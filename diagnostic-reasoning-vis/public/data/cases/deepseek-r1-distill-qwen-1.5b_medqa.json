Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable.
