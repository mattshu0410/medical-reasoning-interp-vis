Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds.

Her past medical history is notable for morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, a sleeve gastrectomy 1 month ago, and depression with multiple suicide attempts. Her temperature is 98.0\u0412\u00b0F (36.7\u0412\u00b0C), blood pressure is 104/54 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her physical exam is notable for generalized confusion. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 22 mg/dL\nGlucose: 41 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2
