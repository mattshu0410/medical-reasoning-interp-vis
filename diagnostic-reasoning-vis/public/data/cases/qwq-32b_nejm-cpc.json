[{"id": "ec6731a6f3265c552fc9ad26d3d2345d", "qid": 260, "prompt": "A 31-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustular rash. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white \u201cbumps\u201d around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started. During the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation. Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, with raised borders (Figure 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicular lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter, were filled with clear fluid, and had surrounding erythema (Figure 2A and 2B). Photographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission.Panel A shows a tender perianal ulcer, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. Panel B shows an ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that is similar in appearance to the perianal ulcer. Panel C shows that the ulcer has heaped margins around a central dry base. In all panels, the patient\u2019s hands are shown. Photographs of the Rash.Panels A and B show scattered papulovesicular lesions on the chest that were present 2 days before admission. The lesions measure 2 mm in diameter, are filled with clear fluid, and have surrounding erythema. Panel C shows a lesion on the right palm that was present at the time of admission. Panel D shows a papulovesicular lesion on the left second finger, which was one of the last skin lesions to develop, approximately 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens forNeisseria gonorrhoeaeandChlamydia trachomatisnucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started. During the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis (Figure 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital. Photograph from Anoscopic Examination.A photograph obtained during anoscopy, performed on the day of admission, shows intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm (Figure 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.

The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when sore throat, subjective fever, malaise, and diffuse myalgias developed. On evaluation by his primary care physician on the second day of illness, a clinical diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis was made, and a 7-day course of oral penicillin was prescribed. Three days later, the patient was seen in an urgent care clinic because of fatigue and worsening myalgias. He reported that the sore throat and fever had improved. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus was negative, and the patient returned home. Fifteen days later, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic with persistent myalgias and malaise and a 5-day history of increased sore throat and fever. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was positive, and a blood culture was negative. Oral levofloxacin was prescribed, and the patient returned home. Four days later, shortness of breath and pain on the left side of the chest developed. The patient returned to his primary care physician. The chest pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), increased with deep inspiration and radiated to the left shoulder and back. The sore throat had improved, but fever, myalgias, and malaise persisted. The patient appeared ill. The white-cell count was 23,800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4700 to 10,800), the C-reactive protein level was 29.5 mg per deciliter (reference value, <0.8), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 96 mm per hour (reference value, <15), and a blood culture was obtained. The next day, the patient was admitted to a hospital near his home. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, and tachycardia was present. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck and a transthoracic echocardiogram were reportedly normal. Oral azithromycin and intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and hydromorphone hydrochloride were administered. The patient\u2019s pain improved somewhat, but fever and shortness of breath persisted. On the third hospital day, CT of the chest reportedly revealed right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, small bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. A test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Antibodies indicative of past infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus were detected. Over the next 2 days, abdominal pain developed. On the fifth hospital day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed; no abnormalities were noted in the abdomen or pelvis, but moderate bilateral pleural effusions, dependent bibasilar opacities, and a moderate pericardial effusion were seen in the visualized portion of the lower thorax. A transesophageal echocardiogram that was obtained the next day showed a small circumferential pericardial effusion with some fibrinous strands; no vegetations were seen, and the estimated ejection fraction was 65%. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Indomethacin and colchicine were administered orally. Swelling of the shoulders and elbows, stiffness of the shoulders, and a faint erythematous rash on the face, neck, and arms developed. Fever (with temperatures between 38.9\u00b0C and 39.4\u00b0C) and myalgias persisted, and dyspnea progressively increased. The administration of intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen (through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute) was begun. An antistreptolysin O titer was 289 IU per milliliter (reference value, <530). On the 11th hospital day, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large anterior pericardial effusion and a moderate posterior pericardial effusion, as well as marked respiratory variation of tricuspid inflow. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit at this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pain on the left side of the chest and in the left shoulder, dyspnea, diffuse myalgias, anorexia, and loose stools. His parents also reported that he had had jerking movements during sleep over the past 2 days. The patient was a college student and lived with roommates. He was sexually active and consistently used condoms. He had had no exposure to animals and had not traveled outside New England during the previous 4 years. He did not use tobacco, but he smoked marijuana approximately two times per month and drank five or six beers once per week. He had no known allergies. His brother had recently died at 32 years of age from intravenous-drug use that was complicated by fungal endocarditis with an abscess of the mitral-valve ring. On examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. The temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/83 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 14 mm Hg. The heart sounds were distant. The jugular venous pressure was greater than 19 cm of water, and Kussmaul\u2019s sign (distention of the jugular veins during inspiration) was present. There was dullness on percussion at both lung bases, and Ewart\u2019s sign (dullness inferior to the left scapula, with bronchial breath sounds and bronchophony) was present. There was pitting edema of the legs below the knees and mild swelling around the shoulders and elbows, without effusions. There were faint pink macules on the forearms and the right antecubital fossa (Figure 1) that were no longer visible after 1 hour. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The results of urinalysis were normal. A blood culture, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained.

An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2A), obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed that the cardiac silhouette was symmetrically enlarged and had an appearance that was consistent with the water-bottle sign (in which the rounded and enlarged cardiac silhouette on frontal chest radiography mimics the appearance of an old-fashioned water bottle); this finding is classically associated with pericardial effusion. There were no signs of specific cardiac-chamber enlargement, although cardiac dilatation could also cause the symmetrically enlarged cardiac silhouette. The presence of cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature, indistinct vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing was consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There was blunting of the costophrenic angles and opacification of the lower lung zones bilaterally; these findings are consistent with bilateral small pleural effusions (larger on the left side than on the right) and associated atelectasis. Imaging and Cardiology Studies of the Chest.An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Panel A), obtained with the patient in an upright position, shows that the cardiac silhouette is symmetrically enlarged; this finding is consistent with the water-bottle sign, which is classically associated with pericardial effusion. The presence of cephalization of pulmonary vasculature, indistinct vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing is consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles and opacification of the lower lung zones bilaterally; these findings are consistent with bilateral small pleural effusions (larger on the left side than on the right) and associated atelectasis. An electrocardiogram (Panel B) shows PR-segment elevation in lead aVR, subtle PR-segment depression in leads I and II, and T-wave inversions in the mid-precordium. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Panel C) shows a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion (asterisks), with right atrial inversion during early atrial diastole (arrow). LA denotes left atrium, LV left ventricle, RA right atrium, and RV right ventricle. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2B) that was obtained on admission showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, PR-segment elevation in lead aVR, subtle PR-segment depression in leads I and II, submillimeter elevation of the J point (the junction between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment) in the lateral leads, and minor mid-precordial T-wave inversions. Ischemic ST-segment changes, PR-segment elongation, concave ST-segment elevations, low QRS voltage, and electrical alternans were absent, but there was minor respiratory variation in QRS voltage. These findings, particularly the resolving PR-segment changes and the first appearance of a minor T-wave inversion, could be consistent with a stage III pericarditic process that had been developing for several weeks.1 A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2C) showed normal biventricular function and chamber size, only trace tricuspid regurgitation, and no other valvular abnormalities. Circumferential pericardial effusion was seen, with maximum diastolic dimensions of 3.6 cm posterior to the right atrium, 2.5 cm at the lateral wall of the left ventricle, and 2.0 cm anteriorly. Fibrin strands were attached to the visceral pericardium, but this layer did not appear thickened or have parallel motion with the parietal pericardial layer on M-mode tracings (a finding that would have suggested constriction). Bilateral pleural effusions were present. The inferior vena cava measured 2.3 cm in diameter and did not collapse with inspiration, and there were exaggerated respirophasic variations in the transtricuspid and transmitral flow velocities that were suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure. Right atrial inversion and intermittent, transient, late diastolic inversion of the right ventricular free wall were seen.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 days before this admission, when burning epigastric pain developed after she ate a meal. Nausea and vomiting occurred 1 hour later; there was no diarrhea. After the pain persisted for 8 hours, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/94 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The abdomen was soft but distended; there was diffuse mild tenderness on palpation, without rebound or guarding. The white-cell count was 12,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the blood lipase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement. The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction. Imaging Studies.An axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo MRI of the abdomen (Panel A) shows bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement (arrows). An axial non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT image of the chest (Panel B) shows irregular cysts in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued. On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast. On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative. On the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care. On arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until she was 3 years of age, when she began to have recurrent falls, difficulty walking, and seizures. A diagnostic evaluation at another hospital included a muscle biopsy, electroencephalography, and electroretinography, as well as analysis of the carnitine profile, visual-evoked potentials, and the enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; the test results were reportedly interpreted as inconclusive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed; T2-weighted images reportedly showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Therapy with carbamazepine and a multivitamin was initiated. During the next 15 years, progressive stepwise deterioration, including worsening dystonia and dysarthria, occurred; cognitive function was not affected. Exacerbations of her neurologic decline were precipitated by acute intercurrent illnesses and recurrent seizures from which she did not have complete recovery. Five years before the current presentation, anticonvulsant medications were stopped for 1 month. During that period, three flurries of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures occurred. During admission to a second hospital, the complete blood count, oxygen saturation, blood levels of calcium and magnesium, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Medications on discharge included carbamazepine,l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin B complex. On follow-up at that hospital 2 months later, the patient reportedly had dysarthria, dystonic posturing of both arms (especially the hands), and an ataxic gait. Strength was 3+/5 in the distal arms and 5/5 in the proximal arms. Approximately 2.8 years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at a third hospital. MRI of the head was performed; T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images again showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally, with mild associated volume loss. The MRI was significantly degraded by susceptibility artifacts that were produced by orthodontic braces. The blood lactate level was 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [4.5 to 19.8 mg per deciliter]), and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate level was 1.2 mmol per liter (10.8 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.6 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5.4 to 19.8 mg per deciliter]). A preliminary diagnosis of mitochondrial cytopathy was made. Between 17 and 11 months before the current presentation, examinations were performed at the second hospital while the patient was receiving levetiracetam and trihexyphenidyl. Speech difficulties, limb rigidity, and spasticity of the left upper leg were noted. She was referred to the epilepsy clinic of this hospital. On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported dysarthric speech and painful dystonia of her hands and limbs (particularly her legs). The dystonia was associated with gait deterioration that had led to use of a wheelchair. Cognitive function was not affected. Her most recent seizure had occurred 1 year before this assessment. The patient was the fourth child of healthy consanguineous parents (first cousins). She had been born after a full-term gestation, with no complications. Her birth weight was 3750 g. Medications were levetiracetam, pyridoxine, thiamine, and trihexyphenidyl. She had no known allergies. She lived with her family in the Arabian Peninsula; she spoke Arabic and some English, attended a regular high school, and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. She had three older brothers who were healthy. She had a 6-year-old sister with a similar illness that had started when she was 3 years of age, when she had an episode of bloody diarrhea and then began to have dystonia of the right foot, difficulty walking, and seizures. On evaluation at that time, the sister had a peak blood lactate level of 11.7 mmol per liter (105.4 mg per deciliter) and a peak CSF lactate level of 2.3 mmol per liter (20.7 mg per deciliter). Genetic testing for the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) and the Leigh syndrome was reportedly negative, and levels of urinary organic acids were normal. The sister underwent MRI of the head during the acute phase of her disease. T2-weighted images showed nonenhancing areas of abnormal, diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalami, midbrain, and cerebellum. Repeat imaging studies obtained 10 months later showed resolution of most of the signal abnormalities, although residual signal abnormalities and volume loss were present in the basal ganglia. On examination at this hospital, which was performed with the assistance of an interpreter, the patient was alert and her mental status was normal. She had severe dysarthria, but her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was intact, and visual acuity was 20/30 in both eyes. She had fluctuating dystonia of the hands, arms, legs, and feet that was more prominent on the left side than on the right side. Strength was normal throughout. The plantar reflex was extensor in the left foot and was mute in the right foot; deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The gait was slow, wide-based, and dystonic, with inversion and internal rotation of both feet. The remainder of the examination was normal. MRI of the head was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted images showed persistent areas of abnormal hyperintensity, volume loss, and subtle abnormal mineralization in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Electroencephalography, which was performed while the patient was awake and while she was asleep, revealed excessive, diffuse beta activity, with no definitive evidence of epileptiform abnormalities. The younger sister was present during the clinic visit and was also examined. She had mild dystonia of the right foot, an extensor plantar reflex in the right foot, and a clumsy gait. The patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic of this hospital (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). She came to the visit in a wheelchair. Her speech was dysarthric in both English and Arabic. She had previously been a fluent Arabic speaker. While the patient was sitting quietly, she had dystonic posturing of the left hand and both feet. During any activation procedure, the dystonic posturing of the left hand and left foot increased. During rapid successive movements, slowness and dystonic posturing were more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. There was no rigidity of the arms or legs. When she walked, dystonic posturing was more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. A pull test revealed good postural stability.

The patient had been in his usual state of health when he was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for a preoperative evaluation of chronic kidney disease, before a transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. Eighteen years before this evaluation, an elevated creatinine level had been found incidentally during an evaluation of fatigue, malaise, and joint stiffness. The patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of another hospital, and biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Pathological examination of the kidney-biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed glomeruli with thickened capillary walls and mild mesangial hypercellularity. A Jones\u2019 silver stain showed \u201cspikes\u201d and \u201cbubbles\u201d in the glomerular basement membrane, features typical of membranous nephropathy. The interstitium had an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils, with tubulitis and without granulomas or neutrophils. Immunofluorescence showed staining of granular deposits for IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium. Other stains (C1q, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and albumin) were negative. Electron microscopy showed widespread amorphous subepithelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium, with surrounding spikes and podocyte foot-process effacement. Arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis were also present. At the other hospital, these findings were interpreted as membranous nephropathy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with eosinophils, and arterionephrosclerosis with global glomerulosclerosis.

Electron microscopy of a glomerulus (Panel D) shows amorphous subepithelial deposits (arrows) with adjacent spikes in the glomerular basement membrane (arrowheads) and in the mesangium (asterisk); these findings are typical of membranous nephropathy. The patient was told that his kidney disease was consistent with a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Prednisone was administered for 6 months and then tapered to a lower dose. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate and furosemide was initiated, as was treatment with losartan, although losartan was intermittently stopped because of hyperkalemia; prednisone was continued. During the next 18 years, the creatinine level gradually increased to 3.28 mg per deciliter (290 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.70 to 1.18 mg per deciliter [62 to 104 \u03bcmol per liter]). Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis complicated by diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. One year later, painless enlargement of the right lacrimal gland occurred. Surgical excision of the right lacrimal gland was performed at the other hospital, and examination of the excised specimen reportedly revealed nonspecific inflammation. The next year, enlargement of the left lacrimal gland and the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands developed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed masslike abnormalities of the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. The abnormalities were hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. The patient declined another glandular biopsy and was told that he probably had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Glandular enlargement resolved, and during the next 23 years, the patient was treated with prednisone for presumptive Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Two years before the current evaluation, shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure on exertion developed; these symptoms usually resolved after approximately 20 minutes of rest. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and aortic stenosis was diagnosed. Four months before the current evaluation, the shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure worsened, such that the patient became unable to carry his groceries a short distance to his house. Additional imaging and cardiology studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the heart, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple large aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with associated mural thrombus (Figure 2A through 2D; andVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was extensive coronary-artery calcification, along with scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, multiple mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and calcification in the tail of the pancreas. Cardiac CT Scans and Coronary Angiography.Curved, multiplanar, reformatted CT images of the left anterior descending artery (Panel A), left circumflex artery (Panel B), and right coronary artery (Panel C) show aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with mural thrombus (white asterisks) adjacent to contrast-enhanced coronary arteries (white arrowheads). There is extensive coronary-artery calcification. A three-dimensional volume-rendered CT image of the heart (Panel D) shows aneurysms involving the left main artery (black arrowhead), left anterior descending artery (white arrowhead), left circumflex artery (white arrow), and right coronary artery (black arrow), with the contrast-enhanced lumen depicted in red and adjacent mural thrombus depicted in yellow. Coronary angiographic images of the left coronary artery obtained in the right anterior oblique cranial view (Panels E and F) and right anterior oblique caudal view (Panel G) show massive aneurysms involving the left main artery (white arrowheads), proximal and middle left anterior descending artery (white arrows), and proximal left circumflex artery (black arrows), as compared with normal segments of the coronary arteries (black arrowheads). Coronary angiography of the right coronary artery obtained in the left anterior oblique cranial view (Panel H) also shows aneurysms in the proximal and middle segments (white arrowhead), as compared with normal segments of the coronary artery (black arrowhead). Echocardiography showed severe tricuspid aortic stenosis, with bulky calcification of the aortic-valve leaflets with restricted motion (Video 2, available at NEJM.org), as well as severe calcification of the aortic root at the sinotubular junction. Coronary angiography revealed large aneurysms with partial calcification involving all the coronary arteries \u2014 specifically, the distal left main, proximal and middle left anterior descending, proximal left circumflex, and proximal and middle right coronary arteries \u2014 and calcified narrowing between the aneurysmal segments (Figure 2E through 2H). The distal lumens were normal in caliber and were not well visualized because of the slow flow through the proximal aneurysmal segments. There was moderate, diffuse disease in the middle left circumflex artery. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed 3 months before the current evaluation, and a subsequent TAVR was planned. During the current evaluation, the patient indicated that the shortness of breath and chest pressure on exertion had abated since the balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Additional history was obtained. The patient had chronic back and neck pain due to severe kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis, and cervical myelopathy; the pain had been treated 2 months earlier with anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. He had hypertension, anemia, gout, osteopenia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included prednisone, metoprolol, aspirin, rosuvastatin, furosemide, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, epoetin alfa, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, pancrelipase, alfuzosin, allopurinol, and gabapentin. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 6 years but had stopped four decades earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. The patient had been retired from his career as a health care professional for 2 years. He was married and lived in a house in a suburban area of New England. His father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died of prostate cancer at 67 years of age, his mother had had pancreatic cancer and had died at 65 years of age, and his younger brother had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died after a myocardial infarction at 46 years of age. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.8. There was a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur that was heard best at the right upper sternal border. The creatinine level was 3.41 mg per deciliter (301 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), which was similar to other levels obtained during the previous 1.5 years. The urinary protein level was 149.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 13.5); the ratio of total protein to creatinine was 2.23 (reference range, <0.15). Results of liver-function tests were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started. Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home. During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later. Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended. Five weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke. On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground. On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation.

The patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fever with a peak temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, fatigue, headache, and mild sore throat developed. Two days after the onset of fever, he came to the medical walk-in clinic at this hospital because of persistent symptoms. He also had atopic dermatitis, which had been treated intermittently with topical glucocorticoids. He had taken aspirin and acetaminophen for the fever, with transient improvement. The patient had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 6 months earlier. He worked in an office and traveled frequently to Europe. Two days before the onset of fever, he had returned from a 3-week trip to Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, during which he had gone mountain biking and hiking. He had not noted any insect bites. He drank alcohol infrequently, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and reported sexual activity only with his wife, who was pregnant. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There were tender lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region; the largest was on the right side and measured 1 cm in diameter. A rapid antigen-detection test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and a throat specimen was obtained for culture. A presumptive diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was made. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic because of fever with a peak temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, diaphoresis, and mild headache; he did not have neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, or gastrointestinal symptoms, and his sore throat had resolved. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/79 mm Hg, and the pulse 102 beats per minute. The conjunctivae were pale and anicteric, and he had mild nasal congestion, a mobile left axillary lymph node (1 cm in diameter) that was not tender, and bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy with supple, small lymph nodes. There were multiple pigmented macules on his trunk that reportedly had been present for decades. The throat culture taken 2 days earlier was negative for group A streptococcus. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, and total bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with 2+ albumin, 1+ blood, and 0 to 2 white cells and red cells per high-power field. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumonia (Figure 1). Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior (Panel A) and lateral (Panel B) radiographs of the chest, obtained 4 days after the onset of symptoms, show a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumonia. After blood cultures were obtained and the administration of doxycycline was begun, the patient returned home. The next evening (5 days after the onset of symptoms), he came to the emergency department at this hospital because of fever with a peak temperature of 40.0\u00b0C and a new rash on his torso that had appeared after the third dose of doxycycline. He reported decreased appetite and had stopped taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen because of gastrointestinal discomfort. He reported having received all recommended childhood vaccinations. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/83 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was present, as were multiple faint, nonpruritic macules on his upper chest, abdomen, and back. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The administration of doxycycline was stopped, levofloxacin was begun, and acetaminophen was continued. Overnight, during a febrile episode, the patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 93% while he was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.7\u00b0C. Levofloxacin was discontinued because of the persistent fever, and the administration of ceftriaxone and azithromycin was initiated. Albuterol was given by nebulizer, and the acetaminophen was alternated with ibuprofen. After 25 hours in the observation unit (6 days after the onset of symptoms), the patient was admitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was a faint, small maculopapular rash on the chest, abdomen, and back; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures obtained 2 days earlier remained without growth. Red papules developed on the patient's forehead and face on the second hospital day and later spread to his arms; the rash was associated with a prickly sensation. The maximum temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A repeat chest radiograph showed that the patchy left basilar opacity had decreased in size from the previous study. The patient received prophylaxis with enoxaparin. The administration of doxycycline was restarted, azithromycin was stopped, and fexofenadine was begun. During the next 2 days, the patient's fever resolved and he felt better. On examination, a few petechiae were noted in the oropharynx. There was a diffuse rash with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules (1 to 3 mm in diameter) on the face, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and feet but not on the palms or soles (Figure 2). Rash.Seven days after the onset of the patient's symptoms, a diffuse rash developed, with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules that were 1 to 3 mm in diameter.

The patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fatigue and malaise developed. The next day, he had multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting, accompanied by abdominal distention and diffuse abdominal pain. He felt feverish, but his temperature was 35.5\u00b0C. He took an unknown nonprescription medication for pain and one dose of ciprofloxacin that was provided by a family member. Three days before admission, his family noted yellowing of the skin and eyes and brought him to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/81 mm Hg, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and had no asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, the sclerae were icteric, and the abdomen was protuberant and not tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of acetaminophen was less than 3 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 25), and tests for hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, hepatitis B virus (HBV) core IgM antibodies, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An interferon-gamma release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas performed, and an abdominal ultrasound was obtained. Laboratory Data. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a patent portal vein and coarse and heterogeneous echotexture of the liver, with no focal lesions. The gallbladder was contracted, with a thickened wall and biliary sludge (Figure 1); there were no gallstones, and testing for a sonographic Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. The renal parenchyma was echogenic in both kidneys. Ultrasonography of the Abdomen.An ultrasound image of the liver shows coarsening of the echotexture (Panel A). An image of the gallbladder reveals gallbladder-wall thickening (Panel B, arrow). The gallbladder is not distended. No gallstones or sludge are present. Apparent internal echoes in the gallbladder lumen are artifactual. N-acetylcysteine was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Nausea and intermittent vomiting persisted; a nonproductive cough developed, but the patient remained afebrile. The oxygen saturation, as measured by means of a pulse oximeter placed on the finger, was intermittently as low as 85%, and supplemental oxygen, adjusted to a rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute to ensure adequate oxygenation, was administered through a nasal cannula. On the second hospital day, computed tomography of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material to assess for the presence of a pulmonary embolism, showed trace pleural effusion in the right lung and dependent atelectasis in both lungs, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The arterial oxygen saturation, as measured by arterial blood gas testing, was greater than 99%, despite low peripheral oxygen saturation levels measured by a pulse oximeter on the finger. On the third hospital day, acute kidney injury developed, the degree of anemia worsened, and the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis, burr cells, spur cells, very few schistocytes, nucleated red cells, and polymorphonuclear cells with toxic granulation. A direct antiglobulin test was negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, and the patient was transferred by ambulance to the medical intensive care unit of this hospital. On admission, the patient reported occasional dark stools and mild, diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by deep breaths. He had hyperlipidemia, and 7 months before admission he had taken an unknown cholesterol-lowering medication for a period of 2 months. He currently took no medications, herbal supplements, or Ayurvedic therapies. He last drank alcohol 6 months before admission, but he previously drank in a binge pattern, consuming 8 to 10 alcoholic drinks at a time, several days per month. He resided in a rural community in northern India, worked as a horticulturalist, and had cattle on his property. Two weeks before admission, he had traveled to New England to visit his pregnant daughter. Before traveling, he had attended several weddings in northern India, where the meals were shared among the guests, but he had had no known contact with persons who were ill. The patient\u2019s father had reportedly died of an unspecified form of liver disease in his sixth decade of life. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented and had no dysarthria or asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, and the sclerae were icteric. The skin was without spider angiomas or palmar erythema. The first and second heart sounds were normal and without murmurs, and the jugular venous pulsation was not distended. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and mildly distended, with minimally diffuse tenderness to palpation. The liver edge was palpable and nontender, with no splenomegaly. There was no edema in his arms or legs. Rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Urinalysis showed 2+ glucose, 2+ bilirubin, 2+ blood, 2+ protein, a specific gravity of 1.010 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), and a pH of 7 (reference range, 5 to 9). In a random urine sample, the urinary sodium level was 67 mmol per liter, and the urinary creatinine level was 36 mg per deciliter. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed after the administration of gadolinium showed mild changes suggestive of diffuse hepatic steatosis, a contracted gallbladder with gallbladder-wall edema, and fluid and fat stranding surrounding the second and third portions of the duodenum; the portal vein was not well visualized (Figure 2). Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Abdomen.Magnetic resonance imaging was performed after the administration of gadolinium. A T2-weighted image reveals changes suggestive of periportal edema (arrows).

The patient was born at another hospital by vaginal delivery after induction of labor at 38 weeks' gestation because of oligohydramnios. The mother had received prenatal care, including obstetrical ultrasonographic testing, the results of which were reportedly normal. Serologic screening tests during pregnancy were reportedly negative. The prenatal course was uncomplicated. The mother took ondansetron for nausea and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and reported that there had been less fetal movement in utero as compared with her previous pregnancy. No meconium was present at delivery. The birth weight was 3.0 kg (25th percentile), the length 48.3 cm (25th percentile), and the head circumference 32.5 cm (10th percentile); the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal nursery. The results of newborn auditory screening were reportedly normal. Tests performed at the New England Newborn Screening Program were negative. She was discharged home on the third day of life. She reportedly fed well and developed and grew normally. She smiled, laughed, and interacted socially, but she vocalized little. At approximately 4 months of age, the infant's parents noted that she startled in response to loud sounds. At 6 months of age, she began rolling over from her stomach to her back and vice versa, reaching out for objects, and sitting with assistance. Her length was 69.9 cm (96th percentile), her head circumference 43 cm (72nd percentile), and her weight 8.5 kg (89th percentile). By 9 months, she could grasp objects and feed herself; however, her pediatrician noted that she sat only in the tripod position (back bent slightly forward, and arms placed forward with the hands near the feet). Two months later, her parents reported that she sat only briefly and then flopped over and that she had stopped reaching for objects and feeding herself. At age 11.5 months, she was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at this hospital. The infant's parents reported that she often appeared tired and less alert than she had earlier in her life. She did not crawl or pull to stand. She consumed dairy-based infant formula and soft baby foods and had maintained expected trajectories on the developmental curves for height, weight, and head circumference. She smiled, made good eye contact, and responded to her name. She drooled frequently and made occasional mouthing movements. She did not choke or have trouble swallowing, she did not have constipation, and she did not have activity suggestive of seizures. She had had an ear infection at 4 months of age. Immunizations were current. She lived with her parents and her brother (3.5 years of age), who were well. Her mother was of Russian Jewish ancestry and her father of Irish and Italian ancestry. Her mother was gravida 4, para 2, spontaneous abortion 2. The family had traveled to the Caribbean and Italy. A paternal cousin had a mild speech problem; there were no other known neurologic conditions in the family. On examination, the infant's facial features were nondysmorphic. The head circumference was 45 cm (50th percentile); the anterior fontanel was soft. Funduscopic examination was unsuccessful. There were two hypopigmented spots on her left thigh; examination with a Wood's lamp was negative, revealing no evidence of neurocutaneous lesions. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. On neurologic examination, she was subdued, appeared alert, and intermittently startled spontaneously. Pupillary reactions were normal, and ocular movements were full and conjugate, with horizontal and vertical eye movements that tracked the examiner's face, bright objects, and light, without saccadic intrusions or nystagmus. Movements of the infant's face and palate were symmetric. There were no tongue fasciculations or macroglossia. She smiled periodically, made brief chewing movements, puckered her lips, and drooled, but she did not vocalize. She turned her head to a bell ring. She opened her hands and moved her fingers. Her legs were extended tonically, with bilateral equinus foot posture (plantar flexion) and curled toes. When pulled to a standing position, she rose onto her toes. Muscle tone was increased, with rigidity; the heel cords were tight. The plantar reflexes were extensor; grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. A few unsustained beats of ankle clonus were present. In the prone position, she lifted her head briefly. Her head and neck drooped anteriorly when sitting. The asymmetric tonic neck reflex was incomplete. On testing of the parachute reflex (abduction of arms, extension of elbows and wrists, and spreading of fingers, elicited when an infant is held in suspension in the ventral position and is tilted abruptly forward toward the floor), she fisted both hands and did not spread her arms. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 159 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80). Other test results, including blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase, were normal, as were a complete panel of plasma amino acids and urinary levels of organic acids. An electroencephalogram showed the absence of sleep spindles during a relatively prolonged stage N2 sleep (a stage of non\u2013rapid-eye-movement sleep characterized by sleep spindles), infrequent low-amplitude spikes in both centroparietal regions during sleep stage N2 (of uncertain clinical significance), and no electrographic or electroclinical features of seizures. Seven days after initial evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed without the administration of gadolinium (Figure 1). The image showed mild diffuse hypomyelination that was most conspicuous in the deep and subcortical supratentorial white matter, with relative sparing of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. T2-weighted images of the posterior thalami and lentiform nuclei showed a subtle increase in signal. The anterior thalami appeared mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the left frontal white matter revealed a slight decrease in theN-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratio; the metabolite ratios were normal on MRS of the region of the left basal ganglia. MRI Image of the Head.Areas of subtly increased T1-weighted signal (Panel A, arrows) and decreased T2-weighted signal (Panel B, arrows) are evident in the anterior thalami.

Nine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. While the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission. Two days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0\u00b0C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer, mycophenolate mofetil, pantoprazole, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog, and he spent time outdoors, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range, 0.00 to 0.49). Tests for Lyme disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A respiratory viral panel that included testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Chest radiography revealed bilateral peripheral reticular opacities that were similar in appearance to those observed in studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier and were consistent with the patient\u2019s reported history of interstitial lung disease, with no new focal consolidation. CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity. There was peripheral reticulation that was unchanged from that seen in the studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, basilar-predominant architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis with evidence of honeycombing in the lung bases. There was a slight decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy as compared with the earlier studies and a single new paraesophageal lymph node on the right side. CT of the Chest on Admission.Axial images obtained with lung windows (Panels A and B) show resolution of peripheral consolidation and multifocal ground-glass opacity, which had been observed on CT scans obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, and new peripheral curvilinear opacity (Panel B, yellow arrows). There is subpleural reticulation with associated ground-glass opacity, architectural distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, and honeycombing (Panels A and B, black arrows). These findings are consistent with a CT pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. The new peripheral curvilinear opacity is consistent with previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. As compared with the CT scans obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, the mediastinal windows show a decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Panel C, arrow) and a new paraesophageal lymph node on the lower right side (Panel D, arrow). Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was initiated. Twelve hours after the patient presented to the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 82/53 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. One liter of intravenous fluids was administered, and the blood pressure increased to 108/52 mm Hg. Owing to the patient\u2019s acute illness, the dose of prednisone was increased, and he was admitted to the hospital. On hospital day 1, fever persisted; the maximum temporal temperature was 39.9\u00b0C. The blood pressure remained stable; treatment with intravenous vancomycin was added. On hospital day 2, pancytopenia developed, and the results of liver-function tests had worsened; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.

He had stopped smoking 2 years before this presentation, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of autoimmune or connective-tissue diseases. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute. A group of five tender lymph nodes, each approximately 1 cm in diameter, was present in the posteroinferior cervical chain on the right side; the lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain on the left side and in both inguinal regions were nontender, and there were no abnormal lymph nodes in the supraclavicular or axillary regions. A systolic ejection murmur (grade 1 out of 6) was heard at the cardiac base; the remainder of the examination was normal. During evaluation, the temperature rose to 39.5\u00b0C and was associated with chills. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of liver and renal function; testing for heterophile antibodies and rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza virus were negative. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. A blood culture was sterile. The administration of acetaminophen alternating with ibuprofen was recommended, as were fluids and rest. The patient returned home but was advised to return to the outpatient clinic if his condition did not improve. Laboratory Data. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic. He reported decreased appetite, chills, sweats related to fevers, mild headaches and body aches, and a new nonproductive cough. On examination, the lymph nodes on the right side were slightly larger than on the previous examination and were slightly confluent; the lymph nodes on the left side and a submental lymph node were soft and mobile. Bronchial breath sounds were heard over the right side of the chest anteriorly, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis revealed hemoglobin D Punjab, an abnormal variant of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, at a level of 91.8%, as well as a hemoglobin A level of 0% (reference range, 95.8 to 98.0), a hemoglobin A2level of 7.0% (reference range, 2.0 to 3.3), and a hemoglobin F level of 1.2% (reference range, 0.0 to 0.9); other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient declined testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged cervical lymph node was performed, and the aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells. Some of the histiocytes contained cellular debris and angular, crescentic nuclei. The polymorphous composition of the aspirate and the mature appearance of the lymphocytes were suggestive of a reactive process (Figure 1). Gram's and acid-fast staining of the aspirate revealed no organisms. Flow cytometry of the aspirate showed no immunophenotypic abnormalities. Fine-Needle Aspirate of a Cervical Lymph Node.Cytologic smears of the fine-needle aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes and histiocytes, including phagocytic histiocytes with crescentic nuclei (arrow). A blood culture and a culture of the aspirate were sterile. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient returned home again, with instructions to return to the clinic if fevers persisted. Two days later, the patient reported persistent fevers and a dull headache and was admitted to the hospital. He reported no night sweats, weight loss, rhinorrhea, neck rigidity, neck pain, vision changes, weakness, or numbness and no respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. On examination, the blood pressure was 106/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was a superficial ulcer on the right side of the lower lip, and the spleen tip was palpable approximately 3 cm below the costal margin; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactic acid, C3, C4, haptoglobin, creatine kinase, and thyrotropin were normal; testing for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, clear fluid, with 1+ occult blood, trace albumin, and few squamous cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. Fluids were administered intravenously, and another blood sample was obtained for culture. The maximal daily temperature was 40.7\u00b0C on the first day. On the second day, the temperature rose to 40.8\u00b0C. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck and chest obtained after the administration of contrast material (Figure 2) showed lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in diameter in the submental, submandibular, and jugular chains and at the posterior cervical level; mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest, at the subcarinal level, measuring 9 mm in diameter; bilateral, clustered axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 10 mm in diameter; a small, anterior pericardial effusion; a soft-tissue nodule, 4 mm in diameter, in the left lower lobe; mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly in the upper lobe; and occasional subcentimeter cystic lucencies, predominantly in the paramediastinal lingula and right upper lobe. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after the administration of contrast material showed splenomegaly, measuring 16.5 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension (normal range, <14 cm); a cystic structure, 3.5 cm by 2.6 cm, in the interpolar region of the right kidney; and no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. CT Scans of the Neck and Chest.A coronal reformatted image from a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck shows multiple bilateral enhancing cervical lymph nodes, the largest measuring 9 mm in diameter (Panel A, arrow). A coronal reformatted image from a CT scan of the chest (Panel B) confirms the presence of scattered small axillary lymph nodes bilaterally (white arrowheads) and subcarinal lymph nodes (black arrowhead), as well as splenomegaly (arrow). Additional test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures remained sterile. Fevers recurred daily. A tuberculin skin test was negative after 48 hours.

On evaluation at the patient\u2019s home, a fingerstick blood glucose measurement was 110 mg per deciliter (6.1 mmol per liter). The patient was combative and disoriented, and he actively resisted being placed in the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency department, he had a witnessed generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, lasting 2 minutes, for which lorazepam was administered intravenously. A limited history was obtained from the patient\u2019s wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The patient had not been ill recently and had no history of seizures or cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or neurologic disorders. His medical history was notable for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. He worked in environmental maintenance at a local business. He lived with his wife, daughter, and son. He had immigrated to Boston from a rural area of Guatemala approximately 20 years earlier. He rarely drank alcohol and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. There was no known family history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disease. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 171/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was using a nonrebreather mask. His eyes were open, and an involuntary upward gaze was noted; the pupils were 4 mm, symmetric, and reactive to light. He did not verbally respond to questions or follow commands. Gag and cough reflexes were normal. He withdrew his arms and legs in response to pain, and a jerking motion of the head was noted. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). The neck was supple. Peripheral reflexes were normal. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. Scant blood was observed in the mouth, without visible lacerations. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood specimen was obtained to test for strongyloides antibodies. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114 beats per minute but was otherwise normal.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve. In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate. Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission. At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home. One week before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested. The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time. Additional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved. Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative. On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A formal neuropsychological assessment revealed impaired executive functioning, marked by disinhibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal fluency, and information processing speed.

One week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patient\u2019s mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours. The patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per microliter (reference range, 1800 to 7000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The nose was packed to control the bleeding, and 1 unit of platelets was transfused. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported a mild sore throat but no other symptoms; epistaxis had resolved with nasal packing. There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate (Figure 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without splenomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative. Clinical Photograph.A photograph obtained on the day of admission shows a palatal petechia.

because of fever and an abdominal mass. The patient had been in her usual good health until approximately 6 days before admission, when she passed a large stool surrounded by clotted blood. During the next 4 days, she had intermittent fevers with associated irritability, as well as decreased oral intake without emesis. She continued to produce 6 to 8 wet diapers per day and to pass soft, brown stools. During the day before admission, a mild cough developed. The patient was evaluated in the office of her pediatrician, and abdominal ultrasonography was scheduled for the next day. That evening, her temperature rose to 40.3\u00b0C; her parents administered ibuprofen and took her to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the patient appeared to be in mild discomfort. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/58 mm Hg, the pulse 170 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.53 kg (93rd percentile). The fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The abdomen was moderately distended, with normal bowel sounds and no apparent tenderness on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Acetaminophen was administered, and the temperature decreased to 36.1\u00b0C. Analysis of a urine specimen obtained by means of catheterization revealed a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity of 1.005, a small amount of blood, and a urobilinogen level of 0.2 mg per deciliter and was otherwise normal. A blood specimen could not be obtained. Abdominal radiography (Figure 1A), performed with the patient in an upright position, revealed the absence of bowel gas in the midabdomen and peripheral displacement of multiple bowel loops, findings suggestive of an abdominal mass; there was a nonobstructive bowel-gas pattern and no free intraperitoneal air or abnormal calcifications. Abdominal ultrasonography (Figure 1B) revealed a large, thick-walled complex cystic mass in the midabdomen that had internal dependent debris and multiple mural satellite cysts. The mass was located predominantly to the left of the midline, displaced the left kidney laterally, and did not have internal vascularity on Doppler imaging. Abdominal Imaging Studies Obtained at the Other Hospital.A radiograph (Panel A) shows the absence of bowel gas in the midabdomen and displacement of adjacent bowel loops. An ultrasound image (Panel B) shows a complex cystic mass in the midabdomen, on the left side, that has internal dependent debris (asterisk) and a thick wall with additional loculations (arrows); the left kidney is displaced laterally (arrowhead). The patient was transferred to this hospital 4.5 hours after her arrival at the other hospital. The patient had been born after an uncomplicated gestation of 41 weeks\u2019 duration. When she was 6.25 months of age (7.5 weeks before this evaluation), she was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because she had four episodes of vomiting over a 3-hour period; she had associated grunting that was suggestive of abdominal pain but had no constipation, fever, or bleeding. On examination at that time, she was afebrile and weighed 8.15 kg (84th percentile); she had mild abdominal distention and voluntary guarding but had no palpable mass or organomegaly. Abdominal radiography revealed a nonspecific bowel-gas pattern. She was able to receive several feedings without complication, and she returned home. The patient\u2019s childhood immunizations were current. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, a sibling, and other relatives. Her maternal grandfather had had colon cancer, and a paternal aunt had died at 20 years of age because of cancer that had been initially manifested by an abdominal cyst; there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the patient was fussy but consolable. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/52 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and distended. On palpation, there was a firm fullness above the pubis but no discrete mass. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, amylase, alpha fetoprotein, and human chorionic gonadotropin were normal, as were the results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. A blood culture was obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure 2A and 2B), performed in accordance with a pediatric (low dose) protocol after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a complex cystic mass (measuring 14.5 cm in greatest dimension) in the midabdomen. The mass filled the left side of the abdomen and was separate from the bowel. Several loculations of the cyst abutted the pancreatic body and tail. The mass did not contain enteric contrast material, and the attenuation values of the contents of the mass were consistent with fluid. Abdominal Imaging Studies Obtained at This Hospital.CT images (Panels A and B), obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, show a multilobulated cystic mass, with several loculations abutting the pancreas (arrows). A fluoroscopic image (Panel C) shows percutaneous drainage of the mass with a catheter. A fluoroscopic image obtained during the injection of contrast material into the cyst cavity (Panel D) shows communication with an adjacent curvilinear structure (arrows). CT images obtained after the injection (Panels E and F) confirm that the structure is the pancreatic duct (Panel E, arrow) and ampulla (Panel E, arrowhead) and show contrast material in the proximal jejunum (Panel F, arrows), findings consistent with pancreatic communication. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the cystic mass was performed with the use of an 8-French pigtail catheter (Figure 2C). A 500-ml sample of cloudy fluid was aspirated and sent for microbiologic, hematologic, and chemical analysis. Then, iodinated contrast material was injected through the drainage catheter to identify sites of communication with the cystic mass. On fluoroscopic images obtained during the injection (Figure 2D), a curvilinear branching structure adjacent to the cyst cavity was filled with contrast material. A CT scan was obtained immediately after the injection (Figure 2E and 2F) to determine the anatomical location of this structure. During CT, only the necessary amount of radiation was used, in accordance with the Image Gently principles outlined by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging.1Because this was a follow-up examination targeted to a specific anatomical region, a specific pediatric (low dose) technique was used; the resultant effective dose was 1 mSv, which is equivalent to less than 1 year of background exposure. The findings on CT confirmed that the curvilinear structure filled with contrast material was the pancreatic duct (Figure 2E). In addition, contrast material was seen in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum (Figure 2F); it had presumably passed through the ampulla. Metronidazole, gentamicin, ampicillin, and fluids were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was administered as needed for fevers.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months. Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes. One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation. At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home. During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week. On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs. Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors. The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400).

The patient was in her usual health until approximately 3 days before admission, when she reportedly began to feel unwell, with weakness, chills, and skin that was abnormally warm to the touch. She self-administered aspirin, without improvement. During the next 2 days, her oral intake decreased. Approximately 22 hours before presentation, vomiting occurred. Nine hours before presentation, she began to travel home to Italy from the eastern United States. During the next 2 hours, increasing abdominal pain occurred, associated with vomiting and shortness of breath, and she took additional aspirin for pain. Approximately 2 hours before presentation, while the patient was in flight, abdominal pain markedly worsened, vomiting increased, and she became confused and unresponsive. The flight was diverted to Boston. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, she was nonverbal and was moaning continuously. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute. The capillary blood glucose level was 116 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter). She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. The patient's history was obtained from her husband through an interpreter. She had non\u2013insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney disease. Medications included enalapril, metformin, glimepiride, nimesulide, imipramine, aspirin, and ibuprofen. She had no known allergies. She was married and had children. She lived in Italy and did not speak English. She had vacationed in North America for 10 days, traveling to urban areas. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and there was no history of unusual ingestions. On examination, the patient was incoherent and appeared agitated and uncomfortable, with frequent groaning. She was oriented to person only and opened her eyes to command. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light; the oral mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. The abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound tenderness, or guarding. The skin was cool. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The neurologic examination was limited because of the patient's inability to follow commands; she withdrew all extremities to pain, and cranial nerves and strength appeared normal. Normal saline was rapidly infused, and dextrose, insulin, ondansetron, and morphine sulfate were administered intravenously. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 beats per minute and a QRS duration of 94 msec, with a tremulous baseline possibly obscuring ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Blood levels of calcium, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and haptoglobin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Placement of an indwelling urinary catheter was followed by placement of intravascular catheters in the right external jugular vein and the femoral artery. Laboratory Data. Within 2 hours after the patient's arrival in the emergency department, tachypnea and increasing somnolence developed; results of venous oximetry are shown inTable 1. The trachea was intubated after the administration of etomidate and rocuronium, and 100% oxygen was administered and bicarbonate was infused. A chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. There were ill-defined calcifications in the soft tissue of the left breast. Approximately 3 hours after the patient's arrival, the rectal temperature decreased to 31.7\u00b0C and the blood pressure to 84/43 mm Hg. Norepinephrine bitartrate and bicarbonate were administered; fluids were warmed before infusion, and a blanket warmer was placed. Dark-brown gastric secretions that were positive for occult blood were aspirated through an orogastric tube; the gastric pH was 5.7. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material (Figure 1) revealed pancreatic edema, peripancreatic fat stranding, a small amount of perihepatic and pericholecystic fluid without biliary ductal dilatation, some thickened walls in several loops of small bowel, and an atrophic left kidney containing a nonobstructing calculus. CT of the chest revealed dependent atelectasis, with no focal consolidation, masses, or effusions, and calcifications of the left breast. CT of the brain was normal. Abdominal Imaging.A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, without intravenous or oral contrast material, reveals pancreatic edema and peripancreatic fat stranding and fluid (arrows), features consistent with acute pancreatitis. No pseudocyst or gallstones were visualized. Cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole were administered intravenously. After laboratory results were known, sodium polystyrene sulfonate was given orally. Toxicologic screening of the blood and urine was negative. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). Vasopressin, propofol, and calcium were added, and additional bicarbonate and glucose were administered. Eight hours after her presentation, continuous venovenous hemofiltration with bicarbonate solution was begun. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Fourteen hours after presentation, the urine sodium level was 136 mmol per liter, and the urine creatinine level was 0.25 mg per milliliter. Echocardiography revealed normal global cardiac function, without pericardial effusion. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed small-volume ascites, nonspecific thickening of the gallbladder wall, and an atrophic left kidney; there was increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys (Figure 2). Renal Imaging.An ultrasonographic study of the abdomen shows an atrophic left kidney (Panel A) and increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys (Panels A and B), features suggestive of chronic renal disease.

She had no chest discomfort but had had discomfort in the right side of her back for a few weeks. Otherwise, she had no constitutional, cardiac, rheumatologic, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. The patient\u2019s medical history included a cesarean section (for arrest of fetal descent and chorioamnionitis), two vaginal births after cesarean section, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (treated with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure), oral herpes simplex virus, supraventricular tachycardia, mild gastroesophageal reflux, a small hiatal hernia (with normal endoscopic results), and muscle fasciculations and paresthesia (which had been evaluated 11 years earlier by a neurologist and had since been quiescent). She was currently up to date on routine cancer screenings and had had normal colonoscopy results and a normal Papanicolaou smear during the previous 6 months. Medications included valacyclovir, as needed. She had allergies to latex, which caused a skin reaction, and sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and had never used illicit drugs; she consumed alcohol rarely, on social occasions. She was employed as a physician-scientist, lived with her husband, and had three healthy daughters. Her family owned a farm in New England, where she had previously worked during the summer. She had two dogs at home but no other environmental or chemical exposures. She had traveled to Africa and to China, where she had visited a panda reserve. In addition to the history of breast cancer among her maternal relatives, her father had had prostate cancer, a paternal cousin had had lymphoma, her paternal grandmother had had colon cancer, and multiple maternal and paternal cousins, aunts, and uncles had had esophageal, gastric, renal, lung, and salivary-gland cancers. Furthermore, her mother had osteoporosis and thyroid nodules, her father had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for normal-pressure hydrocephalus, her paternal grandfather had had Parkinson\u2019s disease, one sister had a ventriculoseptal defect that did not require surgery, another sister had a parathyroid cyst, and a third sister had three adenomatous colonic polyps. On examination at the pulmonary clinic, the heart rate was 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination, including a lung examination, was normal. A basic metabolic profile, a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and results of liver-function tests were normal (Table 1). Pulmonary-function testing revealed normal spirometry and diffusion capacity. Previous imaging studies of the chest were reviewed, and additional studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Review of the patient\u2019s previous imaging studies (Figure 1) revealed a long-standing history of a right pleural effusion, which had first been noticed on MRI of the breasts that had been performed 14 years before the current presentation. Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax, performed as part of her evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, revealed a persistent, small right pleural effusion without abnormal pleural thickening, enhancement, or nodularity. There were several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules that had been unchanged for more than 5 years and were thought to represent noncalcified granulomas or intraparenchymal lymph nodes. The lungs were otherwise normal and had no evidence of cancer. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A right pleural effusion was seen on multiple imaging studies over time. An axial fast spin\u2013echo T2-weighted MRI scan of the right breast, obtained with the patient in the prone position 14 years before the current presentation (Panel A), shows a right pleural effusion (arrow) in the anterior (dependent) right hemithorax. An axial contrast-enhanced CT scan of the midthorax, obtained on presentation to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital (Panel B), shows persistence of the right pleural effusion (arrow). There is no abnormal pleural enhancement or nodularity and no evidence of cancer in the lungs. Several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules (not shown) have long-term stability (>5 years) and therefore are considered to be benign. A radiograph of the chest, obtained with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position during follow-up (Panel C), shows continued persistence of the small right pleural effusion, which is seen layering and extending into the minor fissure (arrow). A chest radiograph, obtained with the patient in the right decubitus position, showed trace layering of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax and in the minor fissure. The amount of pleural fluid was insufficient to sample, but serial images showed evidence of stability and cancer screenings were up to date (with no evidence of cancer on imaging studies of the chest), and thus the plan was to obtain repeat images of the chest in 8 weeks. During ongoing surveillance of the pleural effusion, uterine bleeding, pelvic fullness, bloating, urinary urgency, and dyspareunia developed. Because of the patient\u2019s history of an ovarian mass and her concerns about her strong family history of cancer, additional imaging studies were obtained. A pelvic ultrasound study revealed a solid, hypoechoic pelvic mass anterior to the uterus, measuring 9.9 cm in greatest diameter. The left ovary contained a small simple cyst, and the right ovary was not identified. MRI of the pelvis revealed that the pelvic mass made contact with the right broad ligament but not the uterus. Additional findings included a moderate volume of free fluid, a normal endometrium, and a 3.6-cm intramural uterine fibroid in the posterior uterine body. On both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, the mass was hypointense and showed low-level enhancement throughout (Figure 2). On the basis of the appearance of the pelvic mass on imaging studies, the differential diagnosis was narrow and limited to a fibrous ovarian tumor (e.g., fibroma, fibrothecoma, or cystadenofibroma) or a broad-ligament fibroid. Very few ovarian tumors are both uniformly solid and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging, and thus there is a higher degree of specificity when these features are present.1,2 Imaging Studies of the Pelvis.Axial and sagittal fast spin\u2013echo T2-weighted MRI scans of the pelvis (Panels A and B, respectively) and axial three-dimensional fat-saturated gradient-recalled echo T1-weighted MRI scans of the pelvis, obtained before (Panel C) and after (Panel D) the administration of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast material, are shown. A pelvic mass measuring 9.9 cm in greatest dimension (Panels A through D, black asterisks) is shown in contact with the right broad ligament (Panel A, black arrow). The mass has a low signal on T2-weighted images (Panels A and B) and has heterogeneous, low-level enhancement throughout, indicating that it is solid (Panel D). There is no visible connection between the mass and the uterine corpus. Additional findings include a moderate volume of free fluid (Panels A and B, white arrows), a normal endometrium, a 3.6-cm intramural fibroid in the posterior uterine body (Panels A through D, white asterisks), and a small simple cyst in the left ovary (not shown); the right ovary is not identified. An endometrial biopsy was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a proliferative endometrium and fragments of benign endocervix.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 years before this admission, when she received abnormal results of liver-function tests at another hospital. She underwent a follow-up evaluation that revealed an elevated antinuclear antibody titer. Levels of ceruloplasmin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and antimitochondrial antibodies were normal, and tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies and viral hepatitis were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis was made, and treatment with glucocorticoids was recommended. However, results of liver-function tests reportedly normalized without treatment during the following year. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, malaise, fatigue, and jaundice developed in the patient, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. The alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were elevated at 1844 IU per liter (reference range, 0 to 40) and 1451 IU per liter (reference range, 0 to 37), respectively. She had a bilirubin level of 7.9 mg per deciliter (135.1 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17.1 \u03bcmol per liter]), an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:640 (reference range, <1:160), detectable anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies, and an IgG level of 2584 mg per deciliter (reference range, 700 to 1600). Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver. Prednisone therapy was begun. The patient\u2019s condition improved, and plans were made to transition treatment from prednisone to azathioprine. However, the patient elected to taper the course of prednisone within 4 weeks and started to take natural supplements instead of the prescribed azathioprine. Two weeks later, approximately 7 days before this admission, the patient\u2019s daughter noted that her mother had jaundice. Four days before this admission, the patient was found on the floor of her home and was delirious; she was admitted to the other hospital. She had a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, an albumin level of 2.4 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.2 to 5.2), a total bilirubin level of 15.4 mg per deciliter (263.3 \u03bcmol per liter), an alanine aminotransferase level of 1040 IU per liter, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 738 IU per liter, an ammonia level of 66 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 11 to 51), an international normalized ratio (INR) of 5.2 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.2), a creatinine level of 0.57 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), a lactate level of 9.9 mmol per liter (89 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and a platelet count of 111,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an ill-defined echogenicity of the right lobe of the liver that had not been present 3 months earlier; there was no hydronephrosis. Oral methylprednisone, intravenous vitamin K, lactulose, and rifaximin were administered. Oliguric acute kidney injury developed, with a creatinine level as high as 3.6 mg per deciliter (318 \u03bcmol per liter). Results of an evaluation of the urine sediment were unremarkable. An albumin infusion was administered, but the patient had no improvement in creatinine level or urine output. The patient\u2019s kidney injury was considered to be consistent with the hepatorenal syndrome. Midodrine and octreotide were administered. Fever and leukocytosis (with a white-cell count as high as 27,000 per cubic millimeter [reference range, 4200 to 10,200]) developed, and a blood sample was obtained for culture. After approximately 56 hours of incubation, microbial growth was detected in the aerobic blood-culture bottle, and a Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth showed a corkscrew-shaped gram-negative rod (Figure 1). Empirical vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered; ceftriaxone therapy was discontinued after one dose, and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam therapy was initiated. The patient was then transferred to the medical service of this hospital. Blood-Culture Broth at the Other Hospital.At the other hospital, a blood sample was cultured in an aerobic bottle. A Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth shows corkscrew-shaped (arrow) and curved (arrowhead) gram-negative rods. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that she had had nonbloody diarrhea during the days before the evaluation at the other hospital, without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She also reported that she had coughed up blood-tinged sputum once during the weeks before admission, but she had had no hematemesis, melena, or other bleeding. The patient had a history of heavy alcohol consumption and had undergone a tubal ligation. She had taken no prescribed medications before admission to the other hospital, but she had been taking supplements, including milk thistle and buckthorn. She did not report the use of any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The use of codeine caused nausea and vomiting. The patient was from a city in a neighboring state and lived alone. She worked in the health care field and had an adult daughter who was healthy. For several years, she had consumed 3 to 5 half gallons of distilled spirits per week, but she stopped drinking alcohol after she received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis 6 years earlier. She had a remote history of smoking and did not report the use of any illicit drugs. She had an indoor cat but no other exposure to animals, and had not traveled recently. There was no family history of liver disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/60 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared fatigued but was oriented to person, place, and time, and she could recite the days of the week backward. The sclerae were icteric and the skin was jaundiced, with scattered spider angiomata and faint ecchymoses. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended, with a possible fluid wave. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Clinically significant edema was present from the lower legs to the sacrum. A limited neurologic examination revealed no asterixis. A urinalysis was unremarkable. Tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed multifocal air-space opacities and bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 2A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, central interlobular septal thickening, and a nodular hepatic contour (Figure 2B and 2C). There were multiple prominent portal and perihepatic lymph nodes and small-volume ascites. Imaging Studies.A chest radiograph obtained in a frontal view (Panel A) shows multifocal patchy air-space opacities, as well as indistinct pulmonary vasculature and fluid along the minor fissure, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema. A coronal CT image of the chest, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel B), shows bilateral ground-glass opacities and mild interlobular septal thickening in a predominantly central distribution. An axial CT image of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel C), shows the nodular contour of the liver (arrow). Piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, doxycycline, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were administered, and treatment with lactulose, rifaximin, albumin, midodrine, and octreotide was continued.

The patient had been well until 2 years before this evaluation, when intermittent arthralgias developed in the joints of the hands. Four months before presentation, the pain in the hands became more severe, and new joint pain developed in the wrists, knees, ankles, and shoulders. He had occasional joint stiffness, most commonly in the morning. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The blood levels of electrolytes were reportedly normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests, the complete blood count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A screening test for Lyme disease was reportedly negative. Despite the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the joint arthralgias did not abate, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported the new development of a rash on his hands and feet, as well as pain in his calves that worsened after prolonged standing. He had no fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, several small, nonblanching, petechial lesions were noted on the hands and feet, and four slightly raised, erythematous lesions were seen on the hands and left lower leg. He had tenderness in the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as pain with motion of the hips and knees. The muscles of the calves were firm and tender on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count and differential count were normal. Blood tests for rheumatoid factor and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 11), and the C-reactive protein level was 58 mg per liter (reference value, <8). Blood tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a speckled pattern. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone were prescribed. However, during the next week, the patient had difficulty walking owing to progressively worsening calf pain, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported dry mouth and weight loss of 9 kg over a period of 2 months that he attributed to changes in diet and exercise. Two days before presentation, he had noted redness and mild pain in both eyes but no blurred vision. Five days before presentation, his temperature measured at home had been 37.9\u00b0C. His medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which had resulted in a stricture that required balloon dilation of the distal esophagus. Twenty-two months before this presentation, mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels detected during routine laboratory testing had been attributed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. He had had multiple previous tick bites and had been treated empirically with doxycycline in the past, most recently 14 months before presentation. Medications were hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, omeprazole, ergocalciferol, alprazolam, a multivitamin, and glucosamine. The patient did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol occasionally. He was married with two children and lived in a suburb of Boston. He worked as an executive in a local firm. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/88 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the episcleral vessels was present in both eyes, and a violaceous hue was noted in the underlying sclera (Figure 1A). The patient was able to stand from a seated position without the use of his hands, but ambulation was difficult because of pain in the calves. The calves appeared swollen, without erythema or warmth, and were firm and tender on palpation. There was pain on flexion and extension of the right great toe, with no erythema, warmth, or swelling of the joints. Erythematous papules were present on the left wrist, the left olecranon (Figure 1B), and the right olecranon. Several erythematous lesions were noted on the left lower leg and right foot (Figure 1C and 1D) and on the hands; they were not raised and did not blanch with pressure. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood (reference value, negative), 1+ protein (reference value, negative), 50 to 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). Examination of the urine sediment revealed dysmorphic red cells and red-cell casts that were too numerous to count. Blood tests for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibody, anti-Ro antibody, and anti-La antibody were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies of the left leg were obtained. Clinical Images.Images were obtained during the initial evaluation at this hospital. Panel A shows diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the episcleral vessels in both eyes and a violaceous hue in the underlying sclera. Panel B shows erythematous papules on the left olecranon. Panels C and D show several erythematous, nonblanching lesions that are not raised (some of which measure 4 mm in diameter) on the left lower leg and right foot.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower leg (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, revealed nonspecific, diffuse muscle edema, which was most prominent in the posterior compartment of the calf, with mild associated contrast enhancement. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, myonecrosis, bony involvement, or drainable fluid collections. MRI of the Left Lower Leg.An axial T2-weighted, fat-suppressed image (Panel A) and an axial T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced image (Panel B) of the left mid-calf show diffuse edema (Panel A, asterisk) and enhancement (Panel B, asterisk) of the muscles, most pronounced in the posterior compartment of the calf. An axial T1-weighted image of the left mid-calf without fat suppression or gadolinium (Panel C) shows normal muscle bulk, without radiographically significant fatty muscle atrophy. A sagittal short-tau inversion recovery image of the left lower leg (Panel D) shows that the signal abnormality in the muscle spans essentially the entire length of the lower leg (asterisk).

The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when night sweats developed, which he attributed to the summer heat. Three days before admission, episodes of sharp abdominal pain developed; the pain was greatest at the costal margin on the right side, and the patient rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted up to 2.5 hours, increased with deep breaths, was worse 1 to 2 hours after meals, and was associated with mild nausea, belching, hiccups, bloating, and loose, gray stools. The symptoms did not improve with simethicone or ibuprofen. On the day of admission, the pain recurred with increased severity, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. Two weeks before admission, the patient had had a sharp frontal headache for several days after having traveled to a coastal region in the northeastern United States. He had had psoriasis since 10 years of age and, during the previous year, a few episodes of vertigo with ear fullness, for which he took meclizine, with improvement. A diagnosis of erythema nodosum had been made 3 years before admission, when he presented with raised, painful nodules on the shins and ankle pain; 1 month later, he had an episode of pain and erythema in the right knee (a synovial-fluid aspirate reportedly showed low cell counts and negative cultures). He also had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus,an appendectomy, a herniorrhaphy, and a turbinectomy. He reported no fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, new rashes, or bruises. His only medication was topical clobetasol. He was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and hydrocodone. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and worked in a medical facility. His mother had diverticulitis, and his father had hypertension. His siblings were healthy; he had no children. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, without distention and with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The spleen tip was palpable. There were matted, firm lymph nodes in the inguinal region and hyperpigmented, scaly plaques on the lower legs and waist; the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with 73% neutrophils (reference range, 40 to 70), 14% lymphocytes (reference range, 22 to 44), 6% monocytes (reference range, 4 to 11), and 7% eosinophils (reference range, 0 to 8); the blood level of C-reactive protein was 9.7 mg per liter (reference range, <8.0, negative for inflammation), and the blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 55 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). The remainder of the complete blood count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a urinalysis were normal, as were results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and lipase. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen was negative; testing for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, with a borderline early-repolarization abnormality and T-wave inversions in leads V1and V2. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed multiple rounded, hypoechoic areas in the spleen, which was not enlarged, with no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed numerous ill-defined, hypoattenuating lesions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, in the spleen (Figure 1), as well as bilateral, dependent atelectasis in the lungs. A hypoattenuating lesion in the liver, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, was slightly increased in size from a study 8 years earlier and was thought to represent a cyst; small, nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes were also seen. A chest radiograph showed an ill-defined opacity in the left apex, overlying the end of the first rib, and a rounded opacity in the left hilar region. An ultrasound examination of the legs revealed benign-appearing enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1.5 cm by 0.6 cm. Image of the Abdomen.An axial image from a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen, which was obtained on admission, shows multiple hypoattenuating nodules (arrows) in a normal-size spleen. The patient's abdominal pain improved, and he was discharged on the second hospital day. At a follow-up visit 2 days after discharge, a CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes as large as 1.8 cm in diameter. The CT scan also showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, an enlarged anterior diaphragmatic lymph node (1.2 cm in diameter), clustered nodular opacities within the lung in a perilymphatic distribution (Figure 2), multiple splenic lesions, a hypervascular lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver, and a hypodense lesion (0.6 cm in diameter) in the left lobe of the liver, which was thought to represent a hepatic cyst. Images of the Chest.A CT scan of the lung shows bilateral peribronchovascular nodules (Panel A, arrows), with a cluster in the left upper lobe (Panel B, arrow).

Approximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3\u00b0C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol. Three weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with \u201ccoughing fits\u201d and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal. The next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. He reported a 1-month history of \u201cstabbing\u201d back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal. Laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown inTable 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On the systems review, the patient reported that he had recently measured heart rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute on his home pulse oximeter; his baseline heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute. He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attributed to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection,Helicobacter pyloriinfection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Figure 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism. Initial Cardiac Imaging Studies.A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained shortly after presentation to this hospital (Panel A) shows normal sinus rhythm with second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block. The P waves are indicated by asterisks. The QRS complexes show variation; the fourth, fifth, and eighth complexes are conducted with a right bundle-branch block aberrancy in a typical rSR\u2032 pattern in lead V1, which is indicated by arrows. A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained approximately 20 minutes earlier (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block. There is atrioventricular dissociation, which is defined as the absence of an apparent relationship between the P waves (asterisks) and the QRS complexes. The sinus rate of approximately 80 beats per minute is faster than the ventricular rate. The ventricular escape rhythm is junctional, as evidenced by the relatively narrow QRS complexes and an escape rate of approximately 50 beats per minute. A transthoracic echocardiogram in the parasternal long-axis view with color Doppler (Panel C) shows mild diastolic mitral regurgitation, a finding consistent with atrioventricular block. Intravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1There was no evidence of valvular vegetations. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and anaplasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia. On the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2,Bartonella henselaeandB. quintanaantibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas positive.

The patient had been well until she was 16 years of age, when bilateral thyroid nodularity developed, with normal thyroid function. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration at another hospital reportedly showed cytologic features that were suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Near-total thyroidectomy (100% of the right lobe and 80% of the left lobe) was performed. Postoperatively, levothyroxine was administered. Fourteen years later, a mass developed in the left side of the neck. Ultrasonography performed at a second hospital reportedly showed a nodule, 9 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the thyroid. On cytologic examination, a sample of the nodule obtained by core needle biopsy reportedly was suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. A completion thyroidectomy with dissection of the strap muscles was performed. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, hypoparathyroidism developed. Six months later, a mass recurred in the left side of the neck. During the next year, hot flashes developed, and a diagnosis of primary ovarian failure was made when the patient was 32 years of age. When the patient was 33.5 years of age, ultrasonography of the thyroid reportedly revealed a small amount of thyroid tissue on the right side and a new echogenic thyroid nodule on the left side, which displaced the carotid artery. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirate from the nodule was reportedly suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. She was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The patient reported no hoarseness, dysphagia, shortness of breath, or neck pain. She had a history of fibrocystic breast disease and had undergone multiple, benign breast biopsies, and she had been exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero. She had undergone a right ovarian cystectomy, stripping of varicose veins, and tonsillectomy, as well as excision of skin lesions on the face, with unknown histopathological findings. There was no history of neck irradiation. Medications included levothyroxine, calcitriol, estradiol (administered by a transdermal patch), and oral progesterone (12 days per month). She had an allergy to shellfish (manifested by angioedema) and had no known allergies to medications. She was married, had no children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had thyroiditis, her father had had colonic polyps, and a sister had had a small goiter at 31 years of age. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the weight 95.3 kg. The patient was obese, with facial acne. There was a healed surgical scar on the neck and a mobile, rubbery nodule, 4 cm in diameter, in the upper left thyroid bed. A positive Chvostek's sign (brisk twitching of the lips) was elicited on percussion of the homolateral masseter region, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Eight months later, the left thyroid nodule measured 6 cm in diameter on examination; computed tomography (CT) of the neck, performed without the administration of contrast material, and ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass, 48 mm in diameter, with central calcification at the level of the left thyroid bed. Completion thyroidectomy of the left lobe with partial strap-muscle resection was performed. Pathological examination showed an adenomatous goiter and no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, liothyronine (l-isomer of triiodothyronine [T3]) was administered. The blood level of thyrotropin was 26.4 \u03bcU per milliliter (normal range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the level of thyroglobulin 1.8 ng per milliliter (normal range, 4 to 40). The thyroglobulin antibody and urinary iodine levels were normal. The 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine (iodine-123) was 9%, and the scan of the thyroid with iodine-123 showed a single focus of intense uptake in the left thyroid bed and a subtle focus of uptake in the right thyroid bed. Whole-body scanning performed 3 days after an oral dose of 49.9 mCi of iodine-131 and immediately after the intravenous injection of 39.6 MBq of technetium-99m pertechnetate, with multiple dual-photon images of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showed iodine uptake in the midline and the right side of the neck, findings suggestive of a remnant of thyroid tissue. When the patient was 35.5 years old, analogue mammography performed at another hospital revealed abnormalities in the left breast. Pathological examination of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-biopsy specimens of separate lesions in the left breast reportedly showed intraductal sclerosing papilloma and benign ductal hyperplasia. One month later, the patient returned to this hospital. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Focused ultrasound examination of the left breast showed a dilated duct (5 mm by 8 mm in cross section) that consisted of mixed echotex-tures. During the next 5 months, four excisional biopsies of lesions in the left breast were performed. Pathological examination of the specimens showed ductal carcinoma in situ (grade 2) spanning at least 1.2 cm; a low-grade phyllodes tumor, 1.1 cm; a hamartoma, 1 cm, with benign ductal hyperplasia; intraductal papilloma; atypical ductal hyperplasia; atypical lobular hyperplasia; atypical apocrine hyperplasia; and proliferative fibrocystic changes. The ductal carcinoma in situ cells expressed both estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins. Treatment with estrogen and progesterone was stopped, and a course of radiation therapy was administered to the left breast. At the age of 36.5 years, the patient returned to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital for follow-up. On examination, there were micronodular lesions on the gingiva and tongue (Figure 1A and 1B); the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small hypoechoic region of the left thyroid bed that measured 6 mm in maximal dimension, an increase from 3 mm 1.5 years earlier. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal.

The patient was referred for a lymph-node biopsy but chose not to pursue it. Three weeks before this admission, the patient was again evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. The size of the enlarged lymph nodes had not changed, and there were no new symptoms. He was again referred for a biopsy. Three days later, a core-needle biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed necrotic tissue with fibrosis and lymphohistiocytic inflammation; no definitive lymph-node tissue was present. Staining for acid-fast bacilli, Brown\u2013Hopps staining, and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver staining were negative. No malignant cells were identified. Biopsy Specimen of Left Inguinal Lymph Node.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen is shown at low magnification (Panel A) and at high magnification (Panels B, C, and D). The specimen shows extensive necrosis (Panel B, arrow) with some inflammatory cells; giant cells of Langerhans type (Panel C, arrows) adjacent to histiocytes and necrosis; and lymphohistiocytic inflammation (Panel D), with no evidence of lymphoma or other cancers. Three days before the current admission, a nosebleed developed and resolved spontaneously. The morning of admission, a petechial rash developed on both legs, and the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported 3 months of nonproductive cough that had been attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had no fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, headache, or palpable masses other than the inguinal lymphadenopathy. He had a history of \u03b2-thalassemia trait and deficiencies of vitamin B12and folate. For the past 15 years, a chronic pruritic rash on the thighs had occurred intermittently. Two months before this admission, he had received a diagnosis ofHelicobacter pyloriinfection and had been treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole. Current medications included cyanocobalamin, folate, albuterol, fluticasone nasal spray, and clotrimazole cream. There were no known drug allergies. The patient worked as a scientist and his research involved mice, but he had no pets. He was married and monogamous with his wife. Eleven years earlier, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England from northeast India, where he was born. He had last traveled to India 6 years earlier; family members had visited 4 years earlier. The patient had also traveled throughout all regions of the United States during the past 11 years. He drank one alcoholic beverage weekly and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s mother had hypertension, and his father had died from valvular heart disease. One of his sisters had received treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 1 year earlier, and a second sister had latent tuberculosis; a third sister had diabetes. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. He appeared well. Purpura, including a hemorrhagic blister 1 cm in diameter, was noted in the oral mucosa. There were diffuse petechiae on the legs and some petechiae on the torso, flanks, and forearms. There were enlarged, nontender inguinal lymph nodes, which were nonmobile and up to 4 cm in diameter on the left side and were mobile on the right side; no other palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. The platelet count was 0 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- and renal-function tests and urinalysis. Screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed very few platelets and no platelet clumps. There were target red cells and elliptocytes; the morphologic features of the lymphocytes were normal.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Ultrasonography of the palpable abnormality in the left groin (Figure 2A) revealed a well-circumscribed mass superficial to the iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind and central necrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2B, 2C, and 2D), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a conglomerate lymph-node mass, measuring 4.0 cm by 2.1 cm by 3.1 cm, in the superficial left inguinal region, with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity. There were similar-appearing lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and the left iliac chain. There was also mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in diameter, as well as a small lymph node in the right minor fissure. The spleen measured 13.5 cm in length (reference range, <12.2 cm). Positron-emission tomography (PET) from the skull base to the thighs (Figure 2E and 2F), performed after the administration of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed extensive areas of intense FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as physiologic uptake in the pharyngeal and mandibular areas. Imaging Studies.An ultrasonographic image of the left inguinal lymph node, obtained with color Doppler (Panel A), shows a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass (outline) superficial to the left iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind. The center of the mass is markedly hypoechoic and has scattered echogenic foci that are indicative of debris. An axial computed tomographic (CT) image (Panel B) shows a nodal mass (outline) with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity, a finding that corresponds to the abnormality observed on ultrasonography and physical examination. Coronal and sagittal reconstructed CT images (Panels C and D, respectively) show enlarged lymph nodes with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity in the retroperitoneum (arrows) and left iliac chain (arrowheads), in addition to the dominant nodal mass in the left groin (outline). A fused axial18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomographic (PET) image (Panel E) and a whole-body maximum-intensity-projection FDG-PET image (Panel F) show marked FDG uptake in the left inguinal nodal mass (outlines), as well as moderate FDG uptake in multiple mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes (black arrows), retroperitoneal lymph nodes (white arrow), and lymph nodes in the left iliac chain (arrowhead). Prednisone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, prednisone was stopped and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered. During the next 3 days, the platelet count increased and the petechiae abated. On the sixth hospital day, the platelet count was 83 per microliter.

B-cell lymphoma was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of abdominal pain. The patient had been generally well until 12 years before this presentation, when lymphadenopathy in the axillary and inguinal regions developed and a diagnosis of stage III follicular lymphoma was made. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were administered and induced a clinical response; rituximab maintenance therapy was initiated. Seven years before this presentation, recurrent disease developed; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone were administered. The patient again had a clinical remission, and rituximab maintenance therapy was resumed. Two years before the current presentation, the patient transferred his oncologic care to this hospital. Swelling was noted in the right inguinal region, and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive FDG uptake throughout the body. Biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node revealed high-grade follicular lymphoma. Salvage chemotherapy with cisplatin, gemcitabine, rituximab, and dexamethasone was administered, and the patient had an early clinical remission. Four months later, and 20 months before the current presentation, the patient underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation after the administration of carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan. After transplantation, his clinical course was complicated by acute deep-vein thrombosis of the left leg; treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin sodium was initiated but was discontinued after 1 week owing to severe thrombocytopenia. Five months later, clinical signs of lymphoma relapse were observed, and biopsy of an enlarged axillary lymph node revealed transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was subsequently treated with several therapies, including blinatumomab, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and pembrolizumab, none of which induced a sustained clinical response. Because of the lack of clinical response, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was considered. Two and a half weeks before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital for severe pain in the epigastrium and bilateral inguinal regions. Laboratory studies revealed a lactate dehydrogenase level of 1560 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210), an alanine aminotransferase level of 127 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), an aspartate aminotransferase level of 143 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), an alkaline phosphatase level of 1506 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100), and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.0). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed several clustered small pulmonary nodules, progressive hepatosplenomegaly with normal-appearing bile ducts, multifocal enlarging lymph nodes, and new small-volume ascites. Oral methadone and morphine sulfate and a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone were administered, resulting in alleviation of pain and improvement in liver function. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day. Two weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for recurrent severe, sharp pain in the bilateral inguinal regions, as well as diffuse abdominal pain in the upper quadrants that was no longer responsive to oral analgesic agents. He also reported night sweats, decreased energy, poor appetite, nausea, and constipation. He did not have fevers, chills, headache, vision changes, shortness of breath, cough, or dysuria. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, nystatin oral elixir, methadone, morphine sulfate, citalopram, omeprazole, simethicone, and a multivitamin, as well as lorazepam and laxatives as needed. He had no known allergies to medications. The patient was born and raised in central Mexico and often returned to visit family. He had moved to the United States 2 years before this presentation. He lived with his wife and two adolescent daughters in an urban neighborhood in New England. He worked in the information technology industry. He had previously smoked one cigarette daily and had quit 4 years earlier; he drank one beer every other week and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had breast cancer, and his father had had coronary artery disease, hypertension, and alcohol use disorder. His children were healthy. On examination in the oncology clinic, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 138 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/84 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 61.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 20.0. He had cachexia and was in moderate distress from pain. The mucous membranes were dry, and thrush was present in the oropharynx. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; the right and left upper quadrants were moderately tender on palpation. Painful lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, supraclavicular, and inguinal chains was present. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time, and no confusion was noted. There was no rash. Blood levels of electrolytes and results of renal function tests and urinalysis were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On arrival at the oncology unit, the patient was observed to be in severe pain. Intravenous morphine and normal saline were administered. A platelet transfusion was begun. Thirty minutes later, shaking chills and diaphoresis developed. On examination, the temperature was 39.1\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation was 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was somnolent and oriented to self but not to location or time, and he had slow, nonsensical speech. Blood cultures were obtained. Oxygen, intravenous cefepime and meperidine, and oral metronidazole and acetaminophen were administered; the administration of fentanyl with a patient-controlled analgesia pump was begun for pain control. By the following morning, the patient\u2019s mental status had returned to baseline. On the second hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fever persisted. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Filgrastim was administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed heterogeneous liver parenchyma, diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, and no dilatation of the bile ducts. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new, poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver and new bilateral pleural effusions. There was gradual reduction in the multifocal abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and stable splenomegaly with hypodense splenic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was recommended for further characterization of the lesions. Imaging Studies.Axial, contrast-enhanced CT images (Panels A and B) show multiple poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver (arrows). A coronal, contrast-enhanced CT image (Panel C) shows multifocal abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy (asterisks) and splenomegaly. An axial, T2-weighted MRI (Panel D) and axial, gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRIs (Panels E and F) show multiple lesions in the liver (arrows) and spleen (arrowheads), with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appreciable enhancement. On the third hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fevers persisted and intermittent episodes of somnolence and confusion, including inability to respond to questions, recurred. Laboratory studies revealed an ammonia level of 59 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 12 to 48), a lipase level of 260 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60), and an amylase level of 187 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. MRI of the liver (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F) with cholangiopancreatography, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, confirmed the presence of multiple ill-defined foci throughout the liver, with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appreciable enhancement, and also showed focal lesions of a similar appearance throughout the spleen.

Mammography that was performed at the time of the initial presentation, 6 years previously, revealed extremely dense breast tissue but was otherwise normal (Figure 1A and 1B). Targeted ultrasound evaluation of the palpable mass in the left breast revealed an irregular, hypoechoic mass, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 0.9 cm (Figure 1C), which was consistent with cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated, enhancing mass in the central superior left breast that measured 2.5 cm by 2.3 cm and had irregular margins (Figure 2A), which corresponded to the ultrasound finding and was consistent with cancer. No additional suspicious findings were seen in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the mass was performed. Imaging Studies Obtained at the Patient\u2019s Initial Presentation.Craniocaudal and mediolateral-oblique digital mammograms of the left breast (Panels A and B, respectively) show a radiopaque marker indicating a palpable lump; the breast tissue is extremely dense, and no mammographic abnormality is evident.

Breast MRI Scans Obtained at the Initial Presentation and 6 Years Later.A fat-suppressed, T1-weighted image of the breasts that was obtained after the administration of gadolinium, at the initial presentation (Panel A), shows a lobulated, enhancing mass in the central superior left breast (circle) that measures 2.5 cm by 2.3 cm and has irregular margins; this finding correlates with the ultrasound finding and is consistent with cancer. An image of the breasts obtained on routine screening 6 years later (Panel B) shows post-treatment changes of the left breast and two enlarged, enhancing left internal mammary nodes, measuring 1.5 cm (circle) and 1.8 cm in maximal dimension. Pathological examination of the core-biopsy specimen revealed invasive carcinoma. A lumpectomy of the left breast, with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and subsequent axillary-lymph-node dissection, was performed. Examination of the lumpectomy specimen revealed a tannish-pink irregular mass, measuring 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 2 cm; on microscopic examination, the mass was composed of irregular nests of malignant epithelial cells infiltrating the stroma (Figure 3A). The tumor cells contained enlarged, atypical nuclei with distinct nucleoli and showed a moderate degree of mitotic activity (Figure 3B). The histologic features were those of a moderately differentiated, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (grade 2 of 3), with associated ductal carcinoma in situ (grade 2 to 3 of 3). There was extensive lymphatic invasion in the surrounding tissue (Figure 3C). One axillary sentinel lymph node had evidence of macrometastatic disease with extracapsular tumor extension, but an additional 10 axillary lymph nodes did not have evidence of cancer. The breast tumor was positive for estrogen receptor (ER), less than 1% positive for progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. The hormone-receptor (HR) status was consistent with a luminal B genetic subtype of breast carcinoma.1Invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ was located less than 0.2 cm from several margins. Reexcision was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed multiple foci of lymphatic invasion, with possible foci of stromal invasion located less than 0.05 cm from the surgical margin in the left lateral breast. Lumpectomy and Lymph-Node\u2013Biopsy Specimens (Hematoxylin and Eosin).At the initial presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. A lumpectomy specimen shows the tumor infiltrating the collagenous stroma and fat to form a confluent mass (Panel A, right side); the tumor grows in angulated nests and has enlarged, atypical nuclei (Panel B) and is present within a lymphatic vessel (Panel C). A specimen of a left internal mammary lymph node, obtained on fine-needle aspiration 6 years later, shows clusters of malignant cells that are similar in appearance to cells of the previous breast carcinoma (Panel D). A diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast was made. The disease was ER-positive, minimally PR-positive, and HER2-negative and had a clinical stage of T2\u2013N1\u2013M0 (according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer). A combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC chemotherapy) was administered for four cycles, followed by paclitaxel for four cycles, and the patient received radiation therapy (a total of 6000 cGy over a period of 5 weeks) to the left breast and supraclavicular region. Eight months after the diagnosis was made, anastrozole therapy was begun, along with routine serial surveillance with digital mammography (later in combination with tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography), alternating every 6 months with MRI of the breasts. After 5 years, anastrozole therapy was stopped. Five days before the current evaluation, routine MRI of both breasts was performed. Bilateral breast MRI, performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed stable post-treatment changes of the left breast and no abnormality of the right breast. However, since the last study, there had been development of two internal mammary lymph nodes of the left breast; they measured 1.5 cm by 1.0 cm and 1.8 cm by 1.0 cm (Figure 2B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed several indeterminate pulmonary nodules (4 to 5 mm in diameter) in the right lung and postsurgical changes in the left breast and axilla. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the liver that were consistent with benign cysts. A bone scan showed no evidence of skeletal metastases. A complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, and cancer antigen 15-3 and results of renal- and liver-function tests. The patient was referred to the cancer clinic of this hospital. Menarche had occurred at 13 years of age, and menopause at approximately 53 years of age. The patient had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years in her fourth decade. She had gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteopenia, and sciatica. Surgical procedures included resection of a stage IA melanoma (0.46 mm in greatest thickness) on the right arm 3 years before the current evaluation, of a melanoma in situ on the right calf 1 year before the current evaluation, and of squamous-cell and basal-cell carcinomas of the skin, as well as a myomectomy for fibroids. Medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D, and a calcium supplement. The patient had no known allergies. She was divorced, had no children, lived with a male partner, and worked in an office. She had stopped smoking 23 years earlier (after 20 pack-years), drank 1 to 2 alcoholic beverages per week, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had had hypertension and had died of heart disease in her late eighties, her father had dementia and emphysema, a paternal aunt had had breast cancer at 70 years of age and had died in her nineties, and a brother had metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus, ovarian cancer, or colon cancer. On examination, the skin of the left breast showed changes consistent with radiation exposure, without a dominant nodule. The examination was otherwise normal. Cytologic examination of a biopsy specimen of an enlarged internal mammary lymph node of the left breast, obtained on CT-guided fine-needle aspiration, revealed clusters of malignant cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei (Figure 3D). The cytologic features were similar to those of the patient\u2019s prior breast carcinoma, but the possibility of a metastasis from the patient\u2019s prior melanoma could not be entirely ruled out. The remaining tumor sample was insufficient for further diagnostic testing, and a diagnosis of a malignant epithelioid-cell neoplasm, most likely carcinoma, was made.

Three months before admission, the patient was again evaluated by her primary care provider at the other hospital. The weight was 84.4 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm). Two and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis. Treatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital. In the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister. On examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue. On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton. Imaging Studies.A CT image of the abdomen (Panel A), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows moderate splenomegaly, with the spleen (S) measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension and with its inferior margin extending beyond the inferior margin of the liver (L). There are also gallstones (arrow) in the gallbladder. A maximum-intensity-projection positron-emission tomographic image with injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (Panel B) shows increased FDG uptake in the spleen, as compared with the liver, and diffuse FDG uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton. On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute.

Eight months before the current evaluation, at a physical examination performed for employment, the patient was told he had high blood pressure; no further evaluation was performed. One month before the current evaluation, he was seen by his primary care physician at another institution for a routine physical examination. A review of systems was reportedly negative. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/100 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the skin revealed a rash consistent with rosacea and a small cyst on the back; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 14.0 to 18.0), hematocrit 31.5% (normal range, 40.0 to 54.0), urea nitrogen 37 mg per deciliter (13.2 mmol per liter; normal range, 9 to 20 mg per deciliter [3.2 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), creatinine 3.1 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range, 0.7 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [62 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), potassium 4.5 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.5 to 5.1), albumin 3.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 3.3 to 5.0), and glucose 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; normal range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Amlodipine therapy was started. Six days later, dark urine developed. After 4 days, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported no dysuria, urinary frequency, obstructive urinary symptoms, antecedent trauma, or vigorous exercise. Examination was notable for a blood pressure of 148/100 mm Hg. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 46 mg per deciliter (16.4 mmol per liter), creatinine 3.5 mg per deciliter (309 \u03bcmol per liter), and potassium 5.7 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results were essentially unchanged from 10 days earlier. A urinalysis was notable for yellow, cloudy urine, with 3+ blood (normal value, negative), 3+ protein (normal value, negative), 0 to 5 erythrocytes per high-power field (normal range, <5), and 10 to 20 leukocytes per high-power field (normal range, <2). Urine was obtained for culture. The dose of amlodipine was increased. The patient was referred to the outpatient nephrology clinic of this hospital. At this hospital, the patient reported that he had had intermittent hematuria and episodic foamy urine during the previous 10 months. He had new pedal edema that was greater on the right side than on the left side. Since the last visit with his primary care physician approximately 2 weeks earlier, he had had 2 days of coryza but no other respiratory symptoms. There was no anorexia, weight change, pruritus, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, visual or auditory disturbances, headache, neurologic symptoms, or other bleeding symptoms. The medical history was notable for rosacea and childhood asthma. Medications included amlodipine. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was in a long-term monogamous relationship. He worked in maintenance but had not been exposed to inhaled chemicals or environmental allergens. He had not traveled outside Massachusetts. He drank three beers per week and had last smoked marijuana 10 years earlier; he had never used tobacco or other illicit drugs. There was a history of systemic hypertension in his paternal grandfather and a paternal aunt, as well as a history of cancer in multiple maternal relatives, including his mother, who had had brain cancer, and his maternal grandmother and a maternal aunt, who had had breast cancer. There was no known family history of kidney disease. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 71 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 160/102 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.2. There was 1+ pedal edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of liver-function tests, blood levels of creatine kinase and glycated hemoglobin, the international normalized ratio, and the prothrombin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1andTable 2. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigens and surface antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative. Examination of urine sediment revealed fine granular casts, dysmorphic red cells, and rare white-cell casts.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this evaluation, when he noted while showering that the right testicle was approximately 3 times larger than the left testicle. The testicle was soft and nontender on palpation, and the enlargement had not been present the previous day. The next day, the patient was evaluated at a local urgent care clinic. He reported no trauma, heavy lifting, recent sexual intercourse, testicular or scrotal pain, abdominal or back pain, skin changes or rash, obstructive urinary symptoms, hematuria or dysuria, or discharge. He had no constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, the right testicle had a large, soft, mobile posterior mass; the left testicle was normal. A presumptive diagnosis of a hydrocele was made, and the patient was advised to use scrotal support and, if pain occurred, to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Testicular ultrasonography was scheduled for the following day. The next day, ultrasonography (Figure 1) revealed marked asymmetric enlargement and hypervascularity of the right testicle. A hypoechoic region in the mediastinum testis was most likely related to edema due to infection or inflammation. The epididymis was also enlarged and hypervascular. An associated complex hydrocele, with septations and internal debris, was present on the right side. These findings were compatible with right epididymo-orchitis. The left testicle had normal echotexture and no focal lesion. There was an incidental left varicocele. Initial Ultrasound Images.A transverse ultrasound image of the scrotum shows asymmetric enlargement and edema of the right testicle (Panel A, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows asymmetric hypervascularity of the right testicle (Panel B, arrow). A sagittal ultrasound image of the right hemiscrotum shows enlargement of the right epididymis (Panel C, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows diffuse hypervascularity of the right testicle and epididymis (Panel D). A 10-day course of oral levofloxacin was prescribed. Six weeks later, at a follow-up visit with his primary care physician, the patient reported persistent testicular swelling. He noted that there had been a mild decrease in the swelling after he had completed the levofloxacin course but that the testicle continued to enlarge thereafter, causing inconvenience owing to its bulk and the pressure in the right groin, which made it difficult for him to sit and to flex his upper leg. There were no additional symptoms, such as pain or fever. The patient had long-standing benign prostatic hypertrophy with associated nocturia, as well as Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, mild normocytic anemia, peptic ulcer disease, colonic diverticulosis, hypercholesterolemia, hearing loss, and cataracts. An episode of syncope had occurred after exercise on a hot and humid day 3 years earlier, and he had undergone left inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh placement 13 years earlier. Medications were aspirin, omeprazole, tamsulosin, finasteride, nifedipine as needed for symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and pravastatin. The patient had no known allergies. He performed aerobic exercise daily. He was married, had no children, and had immigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was 20 years of age. He was a retired health care professional; he reported that he had had at least one negative tuberculin skin test in the past. More than 40 years earlier, he had smoked cigarettes for 5 years; he did not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He had traveled to Canada, Western Europe, and the Caribbean in the past. His mother had died in her 70s after a stroke, his father had lived beyond 90 years of age, a brother had prostatic hypertrophy, and a sister had multiple sclerosis. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the heart rate 54 beats per minute, the blood pressure 119/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.3. A firm, nontender right scrotal mass (7 cm in diameter) was located in the posterior region, protruding superiorly to the external inguinal ring. The mass transmitted light on transillumination. The scrotal skin was normal, with no erythema or peau d\u2019orange (orange peel) changes. The left testicle had changes consistent with a varicocele. The prostate was small and benign on palpation. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis showed yellow, clear urine, with a specific gravity of 1.011 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), a pH of 6.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0), and no evidence of leukocyte esterase or occult blood. A culture of the urine was sterile. Repeat testicular ultrasonography (Figure 2) revealed further enlargement of the right testicle. The right testicular volume was approximately 33 ml; it had been approximately 19 ml on an image obtained 6 weeks earlier. The hypoechoic region in the right mediastinum testis had increased in size. The right testicular parenchyma and epididymis remained hypervascular. Multiple new nonspecific hypoechoic areas were scattered throughout the remaining testicular parenchyma. The left testicle was normal. Additional Ultrasound Images.Repeat ultrasonography was performed approximately 6 weeks after the first ultrasound examination, at the time of the current evaluation. A transverse ultrasound image of the scrotum shows persistent asymmetric enlargement of the right testicle and worsening edema in the mediastinum testis (Panel A, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows persistent hypervascularity of the right testicle (Panel B, arrow).

The week before this presentation, the patient, who was a lawyer, had traveled alone to Mexico for vacation. His family reported that he seemed to be in his usual health before the trip but that, when they spoke with him by telephone while he was in Mexico (4 days before this presentation), he seemed euphoric and easily distracted, which were notable changes from baseline. They were then unable to reach him by telephone for 72 hours and became increasingly concerned about his well-being. Ultimately, he was reached by telephone; he was agitated and refused to board his scheduled return flight. The patient\u2019s mother traveled from the United States to Mexico, where she found the patient to be confused and unkempt and to have lost his wallet and passport; he was drinking alcohol and insisting that he needed to travel immediately to New York City to work on an important legal case. His mother escorted him on a flight back to the United States and brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, family members reported that the patient had begun having unexplained weight loss approximately 1 year earlier. The patient reported a history of multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers that had been treated with cryotherapy; he had also adopted a diet low in added sugar, which he believed had led to improvement in the appearance of the skin lesions. He had undergone sigmoidoscopy 12 years earlier to remove a foreign body from the sigmoid colon. He took melatonin and was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone in an urban area of New England, and frequently traveled to Mexico; he had sex with men and used condoms intermittently. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of dementia, stroke, seizure disorder, cancer, depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. On examination, the patient appeared thin and agitated. The temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to which city he was in and to the year but not the month. When he was asked why he was in the emergency department, his response revealed anosognosia and confabulation. He had nonfluent aphasia and perseverated when speaking, but he had no dysarthria and was able to repeat words, name objects and the current president, and pantomime brushing his hair and teeth. He performed simple calculations accurately but was unable to perform two-part commands; he was slow when he spelled \u201ctable\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d backward and when he counted down from 100 in increments of 7. He could not provide abstract explanations for proverbs. Examination of the function of cranial nerves II through XII revealed left-eye ptosis, a finding that was also visible on the patient\u2019s driver\u2019s license photograph, which had been taken in the remote past. There was intermittent twitching on the right side of the face. Pronator drift was present on the right side of the body; the motor examination was otherwise normal, as were examinations of sensation and deep-tendon reflexes. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger movements were smooth and accurate bilaterally after the patient understood the task. The stance and stride were normal, but the patient walked slowly and was unable to walk with a tandem gait or on his toes or heels. The Romberg test was negative. Examination of the skin revealed a purple-brown scaly papule (0.5 cm in diameter) on the medial left knee (Figure 1A), a nonblanching purple-brown patch (1.5 cm in diameter) on the medial aspect of the left palmar foot (Figure 1B), and purple macules on the hard and soft palates. There were also multiple erythematous scars, including one on the left arm with an area of hard scale at the periphery; a red plaque (3 cm in diameter) on the chest with heaped-up central scale, hemorrhagic crust, and purulent discharge; a red plaque (4 cm in diameter) on the left flank with focal areas of scale and brown crust; gritty papules on the face; a large scaly red plaque on the back; and flaky scale on the scalp. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin. Urinalysis showed 1+ leukocyte esterase, 1+ bacteria, a pH of 6.0, and a specific gravity of 1.014; there were 3 to 5 red cells and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field. Urine and blood toxicology screens were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Clinical Photographs of Skin Lesions.Panel A shows a purple-brown scaly papule (0.5 cm in diameter) on the medial left knee, and Panel B shows a nonblanching purple-brown patch (1.5 cm in diameter) on the medial aspect of the left palmar foot. Photographs courtesy of Computed tomography of the head revealed ill-defined hypodensities in the white matter of the frontal lobes, which extended into the genu of the corpus callosum, and in the posterior periventricular white matter (Figure 2A). There was also an extraaxial calcification (4 cm in diameter) overlying the right frontal lobe that was thought to possibly represent a partially calcified meningioma (Figure 2B). CT Scan of the Head.An axial image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows abnormal hypodensities that involve the subcortical and deep white matter and most prominently involve the frontal lobes (Panel A). A coronal image shows an extraaxial calcified mass adjacent to the right frontal lobe that most likely represents a calcified meningioma (Panel B, arrow). Six hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, he had a 2-minute episode of aphasia. The temperature was 38.2\u00b0C. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and levetiracetam were administered intravenously, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 3). T2-weighted images showed an abnormal hyperintense signal in the frontoparietal white matter that was slightly more prominent in the right frontal lobe than in the left frontal lobe and that extended into the genu of the corpus callosum; there was no local mass effect or abnormal restricted diffusion. There was also a small exophytic hypointense lesion along the inner table of the right frontal bone that was suggestive of a small calcified meningioma, as well as mild bilateral prominence of the parotid glands, which had restricted diffusion. MRI of the Head.An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows abnormal increased signal in the subcortical and deep white matter that predominantly involves the frontal lobes (Panel A). These abnormalities correspond to those seen on the CT scan. An axial, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows no abnormal contrast enhancement (Panel B). After the MRI, the patient had another 2-minute witnessed episode, during which he was staring, twitching, and unable to speak; afterward, he seemed to be more confused than he had been previously. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 9 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, without xanthochromia. Examination of the CSF revealed 4 red cells and 7 white cells per microliter, a white-cell differential count of 80% lymphocytes and 20% monocytes, a protein level of 97 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and a glucose level of 53 mg per deciliter (2.9 mmol per liter [reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter; 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). Gram\u2019s staining revealed moderate mononuclear cells, very rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and no organisms. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

management of hydrocephalus was admitted to this hospital because of headache and fever. The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when he awoke with a severe, diffuse, pounding headache. He noted that the pain was similar to pain he had had in association with the malfunction of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt 24 years earlier. The patient took ibuprofen but had no symptom relief. Fevers, anorexia, fatigue, and mild nausea also developed. The evening before admission, he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On evaluation, the patient rated his headache as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On examination, the temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared well, and the findings on a general physical examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which tunneled across the vertex and inferiorly down the left side of the scalp, without an apparent reservoir, and terminated just superior to the third ventricle. There was no evidence of hydrocephalus; the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles were not apparent, and the right lateral ventricle had a prominent temporal horn that abutted a region of temporo-occipital hypodensity and encephalomalacia. In addition, a series of radiographs, which were obtained to assess the position and function of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, revealed several remnants of the shunt catheter in the left thorax, as well as a large mass in the right hilum. Acetaminophen was administered orally, and normal saline, fentanyl, and ondansetron were administered intravenously. The following day, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further treatment. While the patient was in the ambulance, his temperature rose to 39.2\u00b0C and the headache persisted. Morphine was administered. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported that the severity of his headache had decreased. Several weeks earlier, he had not passed an eye examination for a driver\u2019s license because of poor peripheral vision. He had Tourette\u2019s syndrome and a cyst of the posterior fossa that was associated with hydrocephalus, which had been managed with ventriculoperitoneal shunting since childhood. He had undergone five shunt revisions; the most recent had been performed 24 years earlier because of shunt malfunction. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his girlfriend in New England, where he was employed in the shipbuilding industry; he enjoyed spending time outdoors and worked part-time as a nature guide. He was monogamous with his girlfriend, drank an average of four beers weekly, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He had not recently traveled outside New England and had no known exposure to sick persons or tick bites. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 39.2\u00b0C, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/79 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Left homonymous hemianopsia was present; the remainder of the general examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Morphine and lorazepam were administered intravenously, and a lumbar puncture was performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, with a protein level of 124 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and with three nucleated cells and no blood cells per microliter. Gram\u2019s staining did not reveal any microorganisms; a specimen was sent for bacterial culture. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On physical examination the following morning, nontender lymphadenopathy was noted in the cervical, postauricular, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. The spleen was not enlarged, and the temperature ranged from 36.4\u00b0C to 38.0\u00b0C. The examination was otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine, with a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 5.0, and 2+ urobilinogen by dipstick. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear for parasites was negative. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed several well-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic lesions abutting the pancreatic head that were thought to represent enlarged lymph nodes, as well as an exophytic, hypoechoic lesion (2 cm in diameter) at the lower pole of the left kidney. A single-view radiograph of the chest (Figure 1A) showed a fragmented ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter on the left side. In addition, there was widening of the mediastinum and bilateral hilar nodular thickening. These findings are consistent with underlying mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Imaging Studies.A single-view radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows a fragmented left ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter, as well as mediastinal widening and bilateral hilar nodular thickening (arrows); these findings are consistent with underlying mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Contrast-enhanced CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained. Axial images of the chest (Panels B, C, and D) show mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving the prevascular and right paratracheal regions (Panel B, arrowheads), lymphadenopathy involving the right lower paratracheal and aortopulmonary regions (Panel C, arrowhead), volume loss of the right middle lobe, and consolidation due to right hilar lymphadenopathy, which partially narrows the bronchus intermedius and partially obstructs the bronchus of the right middle lobe (Panel D, arrow). A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel E) shows extensive retroperitoneal and left inguinal lymphadenopathy (arrowheads), and axial images (Panels F and G) show retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, infiltrative left renal lesions (Panel F, arrow), and left external iliac lymphadenopathy (Panel G, arrow). Subsequently, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material (Figure 1B through 1G). Axial images of the chest obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving several nodal stations, including the prevascular, aortopulmonary, right paratracheal, and right lower paratracheal regions. Images of the chest obtained with the lung window setting showed volume loss of the right middle lobe and atelectasis due to right hilar lymphadenopathy, which partially narrows the bronchus intermedius and partially obstructs the bronchus of the right middle lobe. A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed extensive retroperitoneal and left inguinal lymphadenopathy, and axial images showed retroperitoneal and left external iliac lymphadenopathy and infiltrative left renal lesions. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were stopped. The headache persisted, and fevers continued. Morphine and acetaminophen were administered, and the patient had symptom relief. On the third hospital day, the patient continued to feel unwell and had night sweats. Fevers to a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C continued. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Manual review of the peripheral-blood smear by a hematopathologist was requested, and flow cytometry was performed. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed atypical polymorphous lymphoid cells with round-to-irregular nuclei, some with nucleoli, and moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm; a few cytoplasmic granules were present in some of the cells. Plasmacytoid lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells were also present; no blasts were seen. Some neutrophils appeared to be hypogranulated, and large platelets were present. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed a differential count of 35% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 54% granulocytes, as well as 3% polyclonal B cells, 27% CD3+ T cells (with no immunophenotypic abnormalities), 4% natural killer (NK) cells, 1.5% CD3+CD16+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and no myeloid or lymphoid blasts. There was a markedly inverted ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells of 0.08 (Figure 2D). Peripheral-Blood Smear and Flow Cytometry.Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of a peripheral-blood smear shows polymorphous lymphocytes with oval-to-irregular nuclei, some with small nucleoli (Panel A), and moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm. Some cells have plasmacytoid differentiation, with clumped nuclear chromatin, eccentric nuclei, and a paranuclear hof (Panel B). Occasional cells contain cytoplasmic granules (Panel C). Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood (Panel D) shows that the lymphocytes are mostly CD3+CD8+ T cells (arrow) with a markedly inverted CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.08 and intact expression of the pan\u2013T-cell antigens CD2, CD5, and CD7 (not shown).

The patient was in his usual health, with a history of prostate cancer, until approximately 2 months before admission, when urinary frequency and urgency developed. On digital rectal examination at another hospital, the prostate gland was normal. The blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.07 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 4.0 ng per milliliter). Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Five weeks before admission, he saw his primary care provider for routine follow-up; the physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Shortly thereafter, pain in a left lower tooth developed, with numbness of the face and jaw on the lower left side. His dentist prescribed 10 days of amoxicillin, but symptoms persisted. One month before admission, his dentist performed a root canal on a left lower molar, which was completed 10 days before admission. Nine days before admission, the patient returned to his internist; he reported persistent numbness of the lower lip and chin bilaterally, with shooting pain into the area of the left ear. On examination, cranial nerves II through XII were normal; there was slightly decreased sensation to light touch over the chin and lower lip bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory Data. Eight days before admission, cystoscopy was performed at the other hospital, with resection of an identified bladder tumor. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly revealed low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, associated with inflammation. After the procedure, the patient's family reported that he was depressed, with increasing lethargy, weakness, and anorexia. Two days later, extraction of the left lower molar was performed because of presumed infection. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because of persistent hematuria, dysuria, and night sweats. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and the physical examination were normal. Test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood (3+), protein (2+), and nitrites. A urine culture was sterile. Narcotic analgesia and ciprofloxacin were begun, and he returned home. On the morning of admission, his wife noted increasing confusion, and his family brought him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had hypertension, mitral-valve prolapse, and a history of carcinoma of the prostate (Gleason score of 6 [on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis]) that had been treated with brachytherapy 10 years earlier; PSA levels remained normal after therapy. He had had nephrolithiasis decades earlier and a hip replacement. Medications included ciprofloxacin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, phenazopyridine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and aspirin (81 mg daily). He had no known allergies. He was married, lived with his wife, and worked in an office. He exercised daily and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had died of lung cancer at 59 years of age, and his mother at 89 years of age from \u201cnatural causes\u201d; a brother had prostate cancer and alcoholism. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable, and oriented to person and time. The temperature was 36.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 140/61 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy and no palpable organomegaly. There was trace edema in both legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, troponin I, and cardiac isoenzymes were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation; other results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood (2+), protein (1+), and nitrites. There was no occult blood in the stool. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed a wandering atrial pacemaker with occasional nonconducted P waves, a ventricular rate of 91 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular complexes; the rhythm was new as compared with 2 weeks earlier. In the emergency department, the patient's temperature rose to 38.3\u00b0C. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, dalteparin, magnesium sulfate, and acetaminophen were administered, as well as intravenous normal saline and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was admitted to this hospital. Ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed left hydronephrosis and a cyst in the left upper pole. On the second day, computed tomography (CT) of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, was unchanged from previous studies. Testing forClostridium difficiletoxin in the stool was negative. On the third day, CT scans of the chest and abdomen were obtained after the administration of contrast material. CT images of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B) show right axillary lymphadenopathy, a subcarinal mass (5.6 cm in diameter), and superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy, all showing heterogeneous enhancement. CT images of the abdomen (Figure 1C and 1D) show extensive mesenteric, retroperitoneal, periceliac, peripancreatic, periportal, bilateral iliac, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Left hydroureteronephrosis is a result of obstruction by left-sided pelvic lymphadenopathy. In the left kidney is an enhancing, exophytic, lobulated mass, 2.5 cm in diameter. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. CT Images.CT of the chest after the administration of contrast material shows enlarged right axillary lymph nodes (Panel A, arrows) and a subcarinal mass (Panel B, arrowhead). An axial image from an abdominal CT scan (Panel C) shows mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads) and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (arrow). A coronal image from the abdominal CT (Panel D) shows an exophytic mass in the left kidney (arrowhead) and left hydronephrosis resulting from obstructive pelvic lymphadenopathy. The patient's mental status improved, and the temperature returned to normal. During the next 6 days, drenching sweats occurred daily. Hypercalcemia resolved, cultures of the blood were sterile, and the administration of antibiotics was stopped. Additional test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device. Three months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen. Eight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patient\u2019s pain did not abate after these treatments. Initial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.A radiograph of the right foot obtained 8 months before admission (Panel A) shows a nondisplaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow). A radiograph of the right foot obtained 7 months before admission (Panel B) again shows a nondisplaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow), as well as new minimally displaced fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (arrowheads). Long-axis T2-weighted fat-suppressed images from MRI of the right foot performed 3 months before admission (Panels C and D) show a new nondisplaced fracture of the distal second metatarsal (Panel C, arrow) with associated bone marrow edema (Panel C, asterisk) and surrounding soft-tissue edema (Panel C, arrowheads). There is also a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform (Panel D, arrow) and previously identified fractures of the distal third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals (Panel D, arrowheads) with minimal bone marrow edema. A T2-weighted fat-suppressed coronal image from MRI of the sacrum performed on admission (Panel E) shows vertically oriented stress fractures of the bilateral sacral alae (arrows) with surrounding bone marrow edema (asterisks). A T2-weighted fat-suppressed sagittal image of the sacrum (Panel F) shows a horizontally oriented fracture through S2 (arrowhead). Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals. Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography. Four months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9) and in the femoral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended. The pain in the right foot persisted, and additional imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Three months before admission, MRI of the right foot (Figure 1C and 1D) showed a nondisplaced fracture of the second metatarsal metadiaphysis with associated bone and soft-tissue edema, a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform, and healing fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation. During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet. Menarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19. During the following week, the patient\u2019s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range. During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone. One day after discharge, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care. On hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d The patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter. CT of the Head.An axial image, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There is moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter (arrow). Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.

Twenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value, <54). Blood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative. Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Figure 1A and 1B). In addition, there was trace ascites (Figure 1B). Initial Imaging Studies.Thirteen years before the current presentation, CT enterography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material. Axial and coronal reconstruction images (Panels A and B, respectively) show diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel (Panels A and B, arrows) and trace interloop ascites (Panel B, arrowhead). On the current presentation, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material. Axial images (Panels C through F) show multiple new hypoenhancing focal liver lesions (Panels C and D, arrows), diffuse small-bowel mural thickening and hyperenhancement (Panel E, arrow) similar to the findings seen on the previous study, moderate-volume ascites (Panel E, arrowhead), and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Panel F, arrow). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued. Eleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy \u2014 which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stockings \u2014 was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen. Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.

To convert the values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. To convert the values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. On the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There was no history of recurrent infections, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer. The physical examination was limited, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasonographically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1F). Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg.

"prompt": "A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain. The patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake. There was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather. On examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position. Imaging Studies.A sagittal ultrasound image (Panel A) shows a hypoechoic mass (arrow) posterior to the right lobe of the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a mass arising from the right adrenal gland that is isointense on a T2-weighted image (Panel B, arrow) and has diffusion restriction on a diffusion-weighted image (Panel C, arrow). Computed tomographic images obtained before the administration of contrast material (Panel D), during the portal-venous phase (Panel E), and during the 15-minute delayed phase (Panel F) show the density of the mass (arrows and dashed circles); the absolute washout is 71%. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung. The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.

The patient had been well until 10 weeks before admission, when a violaceous rash developed involving the eyelids, elbows, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and knees. One week later, intense generalized muscle pain and weakness developed, including difficulty walking, arising from a squat, and climbing stairs. Two weeks later, examination at another hospital revealed a heliotrope rash (a red-to-purple rash on the eyelids), periungual edema, erythematous papules on the fingertips, and moderate-to-severe weakness of the deltoids, triceps, hip flexors, hamstrings, and quadriceps bilaterally. Muscle bulk and tone, deep-tendon reflexes, and the sensory examination were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies of muscle and nerve reportedly showed evidence of a chronic proximal myopathy with inflammatory features. Prednisone, 80 mg daily, was administered, with transient improvement in weakness and a reported decrease in the serum creatine kinase level, from 6700 U per liter to 4200 U per liter. Twenty-six days before admission, the administration of azathioprine, 150 mg per day, was begun because of the patient's progressive weakness (including difficulty raising his arms) and tenderness on deep palpation of the proximal limbs. Two days later, tests of coagulation and the blood level of total bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Azathioprine was stopped after 2 days because of a rise in the creatine kinase level, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed a small left pleural effusion and anasarca. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the administration of gadolinium reportedly revealed enhancement and edema throughout the major muscle groups of the right thigh. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of skeletal muscle reportedly revealed mildly increased variation in fiber size and occasional degenerating fibers, myonecrosis, vascular injury, and fibrosis. Rituximab and a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. Anemia and hypertension reportedly developed. Red cells (6 units) were transfused and antihypertensive agents were administered. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis and no malignant cells. Fever developed, and a possible pulmonary infiltrate was seen on chest radiographs; vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered. On the 19th day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital. He had progressive weakness and was unable to ambulate. During the next 5 days, worsening cough and increasing sputum production developed. On the fifth day, a modified barium-swallow examination reportedly revealed aspiration of thin liquids. Oral intake was stopped and a nasogastric tube placed. The next morning, respiratory distress developed while the patient was in a supine position; the oxygen saturation decreased to 68% while he was breathing ambient air (from a previous level of \u226590%). A chest radiograph reportedly revealed air-space disease in the left lower lobe and a small, left-sided pleural effusion. Furosemide, vancomycin, piperacillin and tazobactam in combination, transdermal nitroglycerin ointment, and oxygen were administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included hydralazine, fondaparinux, cyclobenzaprine, furosemide, metoprolol, and methylprednisolone. The patient had had a meniscal repair 10 years earlier. He was married and lived with his wife and two young children and worked in a service industry. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension, and two aunts had hypothyroidism; there was no family history of muscle, skin, or other autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 175/90 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing oxygen that was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute. Breath sounds were diminished at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. There were erythematous papules on the extensor surfaces of the fingers, elbows, and knees and a heliotrope rash bilaterally. Nontender erythema of the periungual regions was present. There was pitting edema of the arms and legs. Grip strength and the strength of foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 4\u2212/5, and the patient was unable to lift his arms, legs, or head against gravity (2+/5). Red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of globulin, total and direct bilirubin, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and CA 19-9; direct and indirect Coombs' tests and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Normal saline, metronidazole, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin were administered. CT performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol showed air-space opacities and diffuse stranding in the superficial soft tissues, with no evidence of embolism. In the evening on the day of admission, hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure developed (Table 1). The patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. During the next 2 weeks, a tracheostomy was performed and the patient was weaned from respiratory support to nocturnal pressure-support ventilation. Serum immunoglobulin levels and protein electrophoresis were normal. Examination of a specimen from a second muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed tubuloreticular inclusions within endothelial cells, atrophy of type 2B fibers, and a small area of inflammation. A second 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. Stools became guaiac-positive; endoscopic examination revealed two gastric ulcers, which were cauterized. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the lesions showed no malignant cells or dysplasia. Testing forHelicobacter pyloriwas positive; metronidazole and clarithromycin in a 14-day course and a proton-pump inhibitor were administered. Red cells were transfused intermittently, the levels of creatine kinase returned to normal, and the dose of prednisone was tapered to 7.5 mg daily. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital on the 50th day, breathing 40% oxygen through the tracheostomy with a tracheostomy mask during the day and receiving pressure-support ventilation at night. He was able to sit on the edge of a bed with assistance and was lifted to a chair for chair rest. Prednisone was continued at 7.5 mg per day, and the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was planned. Seven weeks after discharge from this hospital, and approximately 6 months after the onset of symptoms, new erythematous macules and papules appeared on the torso, extremities, and face. Examination of the trunk, limbs, and face revealed discrete, erythematous macules and papules that were too numerous to count (Figure 1). These lesions were characterized by central, white, atrophic and sclerotic centers, violaceous borders, and peripheral hyperpigmentation.

fractures. The patient had been born to a 23-year-old primigravida mother after 40 weeks of uncomplicated gestation. His mother noted that he had intensely blue sclerae at birth; physical examination was otherwise normal. The patient's postnatal course was normal, and he was discharged home. When he was approximately 1 year of age, mild delays in speech and gross motor development were noted by his parents and pediatrician, including weakness of the leg muscles and poor body control. He began walking at 16 to 17 months of age and shortly thereafter had the first of multiple fractures. He had had more than 12 fractures before he started school, and approximately 20 fractures before he was 10 years of age; these fractures resulted from minor trauma, twisting injuries, falls, and collisions that occurred during typical childhood daily activities and play. During early childhood, mild cognitive impairment and speech difficulties were diagnosed and speech therapy was initiated. By the time he started elementary school, his language development had reportedly \u201ccaught up\u201d with that of his peers, and he did not require additional speech therapy. He reportedly had mild cognitive challenges in school, for which he was granted extra time on tests and received special-education services, but he attended mainstream classes and graduated from high school. Ankle tendon\u2013release surgery was performed during childhood to improve the range of motion; contracture of the left ankle persisted. Physical therapy was performed. A bone-mineral-density (BMD) assessment performed in childhood was reportedly normal. An evaluation by a geneticist at another hospital during the patient's early childhood reportedly showed no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. There was a clinical suspicion of the fragile X syndrome, but definitive testing was not available at the time. When he was in his 20s, the patient began participating in a sports activity program for youth with disabilities, and fractures occurred with an increased frequency; he had had a total of approximately 30 fractures by the time he was 27 years of age. Fractures predominantly involved the ribs, hands, feet, and ankles and did not include fractures of the long bones or compression fractures. Laboratory evaluation for secondary osteoporosis, performed at a second hospital, was reportedly negative. Four months before this evaluation, BMD assessment with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) revealed severe osteoporosis. The next month, a 24-hour urine collection contained 120 mg (3 mmol) of calcium and a normal level of creatinine; other test results are shown inTable 1. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, a bone scan performed at another hospital reportedly showed increased technetium uptake in two ribs on the left side, as well as in the right ankle, left hindfoot, and midshaft of both tibias, findings that were thought to represent fractures. He was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. Laboratory Blood-Test Data. The medical history was obtained from the patient and his mother. He had asymptomatic hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and vitiligo. He reported pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), \u201cmuscle cramps\u201d in his groin and knees on weight-bearing, occasional pain in his upper body, and occasional palpitations. In the past, he had had bleeding and infections of his toenails after self-induced trauma, as well as acid reflux. He had no history of hearing loss, joint dislocations, nephrolithiasis, eating disorders, lactose intolerance, or celiac disease. Medications included vitamin D3, atorvastatin, and levothyroxine sodium. He had no known allergies. His diet included dairy products (one or two glasses of milk daily and several servings of cheese per week) and two to three cans of carbonated soft drinks daily. He exercised with light weights and a stationary bike; walking was occasionally limited by leg pain. He lived with his parents and a sibling, had graduated from a community college with an associate's degree, and worked part-time in a service industry. He had casual social contacts through various hobbies. Although he had a few good friends in high school, he was \u201cnot very social\u201d as an adult. He spent time in his room playing online games, worrying, and picking his toenails, which he described as an obsessive behavior. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother was of French Canadian and Native American ancestry and his father of Dutch and English ancestry. His maternal aunt had osteoporosis and had multiple fractures after 45 years of age after falls, his father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his maternal grandmother and uncles had diabetes mellitus type 2, and his sisters were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 125/86 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the height 167 cm (9th percentile), the weight 70 kg (70th percentile), the head circumference 56 cm (73rd percentile), and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The patient looked older than his stated age and had a prominent forehead, lower jaw, and nasal bridge, as well as a thickened nose and receded hairline. The teeth were short, wide-spaced, and discolored (not opalescent), with some periodontal disease, and the palate and uvula were normal. The sclerae were pale blue. There was slight central obesity, some muscle wasting of extremities, and normal virilization and testes. The small joints of the hands and fingers had notable laxity, with a score of 2 out of 9 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility (the two fifth digits could each dorsiflex more than 90 degrees); the large joints were mildly contracted. There were patches of vitiligo, as well as hyperpigmentation that was consistent with sun exposure, with no pigmented striae or bruising. He had truncal hypotonia, mild kyphosis, and no scoliosis or vertebral tenderness. He generally spoke with a flat affect but had insight, made jokes at times, and expressed anxiety about being undressed during physical examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. Calcium supplementation and continuation of vitamin D supplementation and thyroid-replacement therapy were recommended. Exercise with weight-bearing and strength training was also advised.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria. Three weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab forChlamydia trachomatisandNeisseria gonorrhoeaewere negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies toC. trachomatisserovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed. Two days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) ofEscherichia coliper milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU ofKlebsiella pneumoniaeper milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed. The inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed an intrauterine device in an appropriate position, normal ovaries, and trace free fluid in the pelvis. CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis (Panels A and B), obtained without the administration of contrast material, show bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (Panel A, arrows), which is more prominent on the right side than on the left side, and right external iliac lymphadenopathy (Panel B, arrow) with a normal left ovary (asterisk). Axial images through the level of the upper abdomen (Panels C and D) show lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis (Panel C, arrow) and a borderline-enlarged lymph node in the gastrohepatic ligament (Panel D, arrow).

hypertension. One week before admission, the patient had accepted placement in a homeless shelter, after spending the previous 4 years sleeping in a public building. During that time, she had repeatedly declined assistance from outreach workers in finding shelter; she maintained that it was her mission from God to stay outside and watch over people. On evaluation at the shelter, she was disheveled and had disorganized speech and thought content that was focused on spiritual themes. She attributed her impairments to a traumatic brain injury that she had incurred in a motor vehicle accident more than 12 years earlier. She did not think she had a psychiatric illness and refused psychiatric medications but agreed to see an on-site primary care internist at the shelter. A limited physical examination revealed extensive tinea pedis and venous stasis dermatitis of the legs. On the morning of admission, the patient reported a severe headache that had begun the night before. She permitted a nurse to measure her vital signs; the blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg. Emergency medical services were called; on evaluation, the systolic blood pressure measured 212 mm Hg. She was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported feeling \u201coff\u201d and intermittently said she had a frontal headache; she did not report visual symptoms, chest or abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and a psychotic illness of more than 12 years\u2019 duration that was characterized by somatic, paranoid, grandiose delusions, a disorganized thought process, and poor self-care. Five years before this admission, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital; as an inpatient, she had brief symptomatic improvement while she was receiving olanzapine. After discharge, she did not pursue follow-up psychiatric care or continue to take olanzapine. She had taken hydrochlorothiazide 4 years before this admission but currently took no medications; she reported an allergy to nifedipine, which had caused palpitations. She was born in a Caribbean country and had immigrated to the northeastern United States many years earlier. She smoked intermittently and did not use illicit drugs but reported being injected in the thigh with an unknown substance in the past. The family history was unknown. On examination, the patient was obese, malodorous, disheveled, and wearing multiple layers of clothing. The blood pressure was 208/118 mm Hg; a repeat measurement was 240/130 mm Hg. The pulse was 95 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a systolic ejection murmur (grade 1/6) at the right upper sternal border, without rub or gallop. Both legs had 2+ pitting edema to the knees, with changes related to chronic stasis and thickening of the skin. The patient\u2019s attitude was pleasant and cooperative; eye contact was good, with no abnormal movements. Her speech had a low volume and a fast rate. She described her mood as \u201cfine,\u201d and she appeared to be euthymic, with a blunted affect. Her thought process was disorganized, and the content included hyperreligious and grandiose delusions. She reported auditory hallucinations involving the voices of God and Satan, as well as \u201cvisions\u201d that she believed were messages from God. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation; her insight and judgment were poor. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The white-cell and differential counts, results of renal-function and coagulation tests, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, troponin T, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, vitamin B12, and folate. Tests for troponin I and urinary human chorionic gonadotropin were negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (obtained without the administration of contrast material) were all normal. Intravenous labetalol and oral captopril were administered; the blood pressure decreased to 187/111 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Laboratory Data. Additional doses of labetalol and captopril were administered, as were acetaminophen, dalteparin, ferrous sulfate, omeprazole, folic acid, thiamine, and a multivitamin. The blood pressure decreased to 141/65 mm Hg in the left arm and 141/62 mm Hg in the right arm, and the headache gradually resolved. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative. Two weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. The patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125).

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly revealed pericardial and pleural effusions and multifocal lung opacities but no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital. On arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping. Other medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease. The temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. An ECG (Figure 1A) showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1FandVideos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade. Cardiac Studies.An electrocardiogram obtained at the time of the current presentation (Panel A) shows sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. On transthoracic echocardiography performed at the time of the current presentation, a parasternal long-axis view (Panel B) shows a dilated left ventricle (LV) and thickening of the aortic-root walls (arrow). A parasternal short-axis view of the aortic root (Panel C) shows a tricuspid aortic valve (AV) and thickening of the aortic-root walls (arrows). An apical five-chamber view (Panel D) shows a very large jet of severe aortic regurgitation (arrow). A suprasternal notch view with color Doppler (Panel E) shows holodiastolic flow reversal (arrow) in the descending thoracic aorta (DA). Continuous-wave Doppler tracing in the same suprasternal notch view (Panel F) confirms holodiastolic flow reversal (arrow), a finding that suggests severe aortic regurgitation. AA denotes aortic arch, AO aortic root, LA left atrium, RPA right pulmonary artery, and RV right ventricle. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions. CT Angiography of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.CT angiography was performed at the time of the current presentation. A curved planar reformatted image obtained during the arterial phase (Panel A) shows an irregular contour of the descending aorta (yellow bracket). Maximum-intensity-projection images (Panels B and C) show luminal narrowing of partially visualized vessels of the aortic arch, including a mild focal stenosis of the innominate artery and diffuse narrowing of the proximal bilateral common carotid arteries (severe on the right side and mild to moderate on the left side) (Panel B, arrows); a severe focal stenosis is seen in the right renal artery (Panel C, arrow). Axial images obtained during the arterial phase (Panels D, E, and F) show circumferential wall thickening in the aorta at the root (Panel D, arrow) and in the ascending segment (Panel E, arrow). Circumferential wall thickening is also present in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch (Panel F, arrows).

hospital early during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), because of cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when intermittent nonproductive cough and wheezing developed. She had no fever, chills, or shortness of breath. Two days before this evaluation, the cough worsened in frequency and severity and new shortness of breath developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician by telephone call. Humidification, fluticasone nasal spray, and fexofenadine were recommended, as was a follow-up telephone call in 2 weeks. However, the next day, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening shortness of breath with ambulation. A review of systems was notable for rhinorrhea, myalgias, and dizziness. She had no fever, chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leg swelling, or weight loss. The patient had a history of eczema and gestational diabetes. Medications included azelastine nasal spray, fluocinonide cream, folate, and ferrous sulfate; she had not yet begun to use the fluticasone nasal spray and fexofenadine that had been newly recommended by her primary care physician. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was originally from the equatorial region of South America and had moved to the United States 20 years earlier; she had not traveled outside the United States in many years. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her husband and five children. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared to be well and was breathing comfortably. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 4430 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the lymphocyte count was 550 per microliter (reference range, 1000 to 4800). Blood levels of electrolytes and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Posteroanterior and lateral radiography of the chest revealed a 4-cm rounded mass in the right lower lobe (Figure 1A and 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign (Figure 1C). In addition, there were smaller ground-glass nodules at the periphery of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe, with associated right hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). These findings are most consistent with viral pneumonia, although primary cancer of the lung cannot be ruled out. Imaging Studies of the Chest.Imaging studies were obtained on the patient\u2019s initial presentation to the emergency department. Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Panels A and B, respectively) show a rounded mass in the right lower lobe (arrows). Computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest (Panels C, D, and E), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, show a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign (Panel C, arrowhead). Additional, smaller ground-glass nodules are present at the periphery of the right middle lobe (Panel C, arrow) and left upper lobe (Panel D, arrow). There is associated right hilar lymphadenopathy (Panel E, arrow). Additional imaging studies were obtained 3 days later, during the patient\u2019s hospitalization. A portable chest radiograph (Panel F) shows that the discrete mass has evolved into faint patchy opacities in the right lower lobe (arrow). Intravenous fluids were administered, and the dizziness abated. Because there was an initial concern about the possibility of lung cancer, a telephone oncology consultation was requested.

"prompt": "A 29-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of severe dyspnea and chest pain on the right side. The patient, who was a highly trained athlete, had been well until approximately 2.5 weeks before admission, when he was hit in the chest while he was at work; headache and nausea occurred for 3 days thereafter. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, he awoke at night with pain in the right midaxillary region that he described as a \u201cping-pong ball\u201d; the pain radiated to and from the right scapula and was associated with shortness of breath. He arose, and after pacing and calming himself, he was able to sleep again. The next day, he went to an urgent care clinic in another city, where a diagnosis of muscle spasm was made. Muscle relaxants and ibuprofen were administered, without improvement. During the following days, increasing dyspnea occurred with minimal exertion; the pain became localized to the right anterior chest and had a sharp, stabbing quality, and a nonproductive cough developed. Three days before admission, during a 1.5-hour flight to Massachusetts, the patient noted having leg cramps, which was a usual occurrence for him on flights. On the morning of admission, he felt well on awakening, but sudden stabbing chest pain in the sternal area later developed, with associated severe pressure in his chest and transient palpitations. While the patient was walking, he noted severe shortness of breath, with increasing tachypnea and difficulty talking. Chest pain increased with coughing, laughing, and sneezing. In the evening, the patient went to another hospital for evaluation, where he reported sharp chest pain on the right side that worsened with deep breaths; he rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He attributed some of his symptoms to his earlier chest injury. On examination, the patient reportedly appeared to be well. The blood pressure was 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rightward axis. Naproxen and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride were administered, with some improvement. Laboratory Data. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained at the other hospital showed a masslike opacity with ill-defined borders posterior to the right hilum, as well as prominent pulmonary arteries (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) angiography revealed a filling defect in the main and right pulmonary arteries and a mottled, wedge-shaped air-space opacity in the posterior right lower lobe, findings consistent with pulmonary embolism and infarction. However, the embolus was proximally attached to an irregular, enhancing central filling defect that extended into the right ventricle and probably the right atrium. There were signs of right ventricular strain (Figure 1B through 1E). Imaging Studies of the Chest.A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Panel A) shows a masslike opacity in the midlung zone behind the right hilum (arrow) and enlarged pulmonary arteries. Axial contrast-enhanced CT angiographic images were obtained at the lung-window setting (Panel B) and at the mediastinal-window setting (Panels C and D) at the level of the midchest. A mottled, wedge-shaped air-space opacity is present in the periphery of the right lower lobe (Panel B). A smooth, large, central filling defect (Panels B and C, arrows) is present that extends from the main pulmonary artery (MPA) to the right pulmonary artery (RPA). Central filling defects are also present in the interlobar and lobar branches of the right pulmonary artery (Panel D, arrows); the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) contains an irregular central filling defect with central contrast-filling channels rather than enhancement. An axial CT angiographic image (Panel E) shows a dilated right ventricle (RV), with a ratio of RV diameter to left ventricular (LV) diameter of 1.6 (normal, <1); a heterogeneously enhancing filling defect is evident in the RV cavity (arrow), as well as in the right atrium (not shown). Heparin was administered intravenously. Approximately 4 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, he was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for consideration of thrombolysis. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pleuritic chest pain that had improved since earlier in the day. While he had been taking ibuprofen for the muscle spasms, he noted decreased appetite, with associated weight loss of approximately 1.5 kg. He had had traumatic injury with a cleat to the left calf approximately 3 months before admission; the calf had had minor bruising, without pain or swelling. Sixteen years earlier, the patient had had aStaphylococcus aureusskin infection involving his elbow that required d\u00e9bridement. Otherwise, he was healthy and physically active, regularly participating in semiprofessional sports. He had stopped taking ibuprofen more than 1 week before admission and was taking no other medications. He had no known allergies. He lived in another state with a roommate and worked in education. He drank alcohol occasionally and had never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs. He reported no sick contacts or recent hospitalizations. His maternal grandmother had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertension, strokes, myocardial infarction, and a deep venous thrombosis, and his paternal grandparents had had hypertension. His parents and siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/93 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The carotid arteries had no bruits, and the jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water, with a normal waveform. The lung sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally, with crackles involving the lower half of the right lung field but no dullness on percussion. The heart rate and rhythm were regular. The left ventricular impulse was discrete and nondisplaced, and there was a right ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed a normal first heart sound (S1), a second heart sound with a loud P2component, a faint low-pitched diastolic sound, and a systolic murmur (grade 2/6) at the base. There was no swelling, palpable mass or cord, erythema, tenderness, or edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB isoenzymes, troponin T, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen, and total homocysteine were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace albumin and was otherwise normal. An ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute, with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, evidence of right-axis deviation, and no evidence of ischemia. Heparin therapy was continued, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the first hospital day, the blood creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized. On the second hospital day, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2; and seeVideos 1 through 8, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a highly mobile irregular mass, nearly 10 cm in length, with a frondlike appearance and heterogeneous echotexture. The mass moved back and forth between the right atrium and the right ventricle, and there was a suggestion of possible attachment near the tricuspid valve. The ventricular septal geometry indicated right ventricular pressure and volume overload, and the interatrial septum was stretched leftward. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and mildly hypokinetic in a manner that was suggestive of ventricular strain, but the left ventricle was normal. There was trace tricuspid regurgitation, but the other valves were normal. No mass was seen in the inferior vena cava. The echocardiographic appearance of the mass was not typical of a venous thrombus. Echocardiographic Images.These representative images were taken from the bedside transthoracic echocardiogram. The parasternal long-axis view (Panel A) shows an amorphous mass in the right ventricular outflow tract in late diastole (arrow); the left ventricle, left atrium, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aortic root are all normal. The right ventricular inflow view (Panel B) shows an irregular mass in the right ventricular inflow tract in diastole (arrow). The short-axis view at the level of the aortic valve (Panel C) shows the chambers on the right side of the heart, including the right atrium (arrowhead) and right ventricle (arrow); a heterogeneous frondlike mass is seen in the right ventricle in end diastole. An apical four-chamber view (Panel D) shows a mildly dilated right ventricle, deviation of the interatrial septum to the left (arrowhead) that is suggestive of elevated right atrial pressure, and a heterogeneous mass extending from the right ventricle (white arrow) to the right atrium (black arrow).

The patient had been well until 18 months earlier, when intermittent shaking of his right hand developed, which quickly progressed to involve the entire right arm. Evaluation at another hospital included electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed frequent left-sided discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head that revealed no clear atrophy but a lesion in the left motor strip, and a lumbar puncture with normal results on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. A diagnosis of focal motor seizures was made; levetiracetam and glucocorticoids were administered. Approximately 2 months after the onset of symptoms, twitching of the arm and hand became nearly constant and was accompanied by facial twitching; a clinical diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua was made. Intravenous immune globulin was administered, and the twitching in his face and arm almost completely resolved. Approximately 3 months later, however, the symptoms recurred. During the year before this evaluation, the right arm and the right side of the face began to twitch nearly continuously, with more intense focal clonic activity occurring 2 to 20 times per day; there was associated progressive weakness of the muscles of the right arm (more severe distally than proximally) and the right side of the face, increasing spasticity in the fingers and wrist, and subtle weakness of the right leg. There was no history of loss of consciousness, apnea, cyanosis, or seizure activity involving the left side. MRI studies of the head that were performed between 9 months and 3 months before this evaluation reportedly revealed a T2-weighted hyperintense lesion in the left motor strip involving the adjacent white matter and, in more recent studies, the parietal region, with no clear evidence of atrophy. A brain biopsy was recommended. The family sought a second opinion at this hospital. The patient was born at 36 weeks of gestation after the onset of preterm labor and had normal or advanced developmental milestones (including reading at 3 years of age). He had reactive airway disease and had undergone tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and urologic surgery. Medications included levetiracetam (800 mg twice daily), clonazepam (0.5 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening), oxcarbazepine (360 mg in the morning and 420 mg in the evening), valproic acid (375 mg twice daily), lipoic acid, vitamin B6, and coenzyme Q10. Immunizations were current. He had no known drug allergies. He consumed a ketogenic diet (a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet), which helped to control his seizures, and he participated in occupational and physical therapy. He lived with his parents and older sibling, was in second grade, and did well academically. His mother and sibling had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, a paternal aunt had bipolar disorder, and other paternal relatives had depression. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and pleasant. His speech was clear and fluent, with mild dysarthria. He seemed to be intelligent, with good social skills. The pupils and extraocular movements were normal. There was weakness on the right side of the face, the palate was elevated symmetrically, and the tongue protruded along the midline. There was nearly continuous twitching of the right lower facial muscles. Muscle bulk, tone, and strength were normal in the left arm and leg. In the right arm, strength was 4/5 proximally, with little movement of the fingers or wrist and distal-muscle spasticity. Strength in the right leg was 4+/5, with slightly increased reflexes. The gait was mildly hemiparetic. A brain biopsy was recommended, and the family resumed care at the other hospital. During the next 6 months, twitching was constant in the right side of the face and nearly continuous in the right arm. The focal seizures in the right side of the face and right arm and leg (which frequently caused the patient to fall) occurred up to 20 times daily when he was tired or sick or had not adhered to his diet. Weakness of the right leg and arm increased, and his gait became more hemiparetic, despite continued medical therapy with levetiracetam, clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, and valproic acid and general adherence to the ketogenic diet. Six months after the initial evaluation at this hospital, the patient returned to this hospital for care. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed seizure activity in the left frontal lobe, with discharges predominantly in the posterior left frontal cortex, along the frontal operculum of the motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and the area associated with control of the hand, and abnormal somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields in the left hemisphere, findings suggestive of cortical dysfunction. During the MEG recording, there was continuous right facial twitching and some evidence that the right hemisphere was dominant for language. Three months later, the patient was admitted to this hospital. A 24-hour EEG showed that the focus of his continuous right facial twitching was in the left frontal area, with a broad electrical field involving the entire left hemisphere. EEG also recorded six generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (1 to 2 Hz); the site of maximal amplitude was the midline central region, and the duration was approximately 15 to 40 seconds.

The patient had been well until approximately 24 months before this evaluation, when a dry, nonproductive cough developed. Results of laboratory testing, which was performed at another hospital, are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Twenty-one months before this evaluation, when the patient was seen by her physician at another clinic, she reported persistent cough, decreased appetite, and moderate but poorly localized abdominal pain. On examination, her weight was 108.9 kg (decreased from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg 5 months earlier). A proton-pump inhibitor was administered. During the following month, fatigue and myalgias occurred, followed by the appearance of painless \u201cred dots\u201d around her ankles. Evaluation of a skin-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed findings consistent with early pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Blood tests revealed peripheral eosinophilia. Twenty months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at the other hospital because of persistent cough; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening, a finding suggestive of chronic inflammation. Mildly enlarged lymph nodes were present in the paracardiac region, porta hepatis, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. During the following year, multiple evaluations by consultants in allergy, rheumatology, hematology\u2013oncology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology were performed. Nineteen months before this evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, and pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum revealed mild chronic and focally active gastritis. Immunohistochemical staining forHelicobacter pyloriwas negative, and the small-bowel villi were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed at the other hospital 18 months before this evaluation, revealed enlarged periportal lymph nodes. No focal lesions were seen in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, or adrenal glands. There was mild splenomegaly. The pancreas was not enlarged. Sixteen months before this evaluation, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed mild bronchial-wall thickening, lymphadenopathy in the axillae (with the largest node, in the right axilla, measuring 2.3 cm by 1.3 cm), an enlarged right epicardial lymph node (measuring 1.5 cm by 1.1 cm), and enlarged nodes in the portacaval, peripancreatic, and mesenteric regions (with the largest node, in the porta hepatis, measuring 4.2 cm by 2.9 cm). One month later, pathological examination of a right axillary lymph node revealed preserved architecture. Follicular and paracortical hyperplasia was present, along with a polytypic plasmacytosis. Immunostaining for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. The findings were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy; no evidence of hematologic cancer was identified. Therapeutic trials of oral metoclopramide, cetirizine, omeprazole, and budesonide; fluticasone nasal spray; and inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol resulted in no improvement. The patient continued to lose weight. Thirteen months before this evaluation,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET), performed at the other hospital, revealed FDG-avid lymph nodes in the axillae, the paracardial region, and the region of the right internal thoracic artery. The liver and spleen were enlarged and showed diffuse FDG uptake. Examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate revealed hypercellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, increased eosinophils, megakaryocytes, and polyclonal plasma cells, findings that are consistent with a reactive process. Biopsy of the liver was performed to investigate the hepatosplenomegaly and the FDG uptake in the liver and spleen. Pathological examination of a core needle\u2013biopsy specimen of the liver revealed moderate-to-severe portal, periportal, and lobular inflammation that was predominantly composed of plasma cells (with polytypic expression of kappa and lambda light chains on immunohistochemical staining), with occasional eosinophils. Bile-duct proliferation, focal damage, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and scattered apoptotic hepatocytes were seen, and trichrome staining highlighted the presence of sinusoidal fibrosis. A stain for iron deposition was negative. The findings were thought to be consistent with an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and focal sclerosing cholangitis. Treatment with prednisone was begun but was discontinued by the patient for unspecified reasons. Azathioprine therapy was also begun at this time. A decrease in abdominal pain and fatigue was reported. Seven months before this evaluation, an FDG-PET examination with CT for attenuation correction was performed at the other hospital (Figure 1). Splenomegaly was present, and stably enlarged FDG-avid lymph nodes were seen in the axillae, the region of the internal thoracic artery, the right paracardiac region, and the retroperitoneal, iliac, and inguinal regions. There was no hilar lymphadenopathy. There was diffuse, mild, smooth bronchial-wall thickening. No pulmonary nodules or air-space opacities were present. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron-Emission Tomographic (PET) Scan.An FDG-PET examination with CT for attenuation correction was performed 7 months before the patient was evaluated at this hospital. An axial image obtained at the level of the aortic arch shows FDG-avid, enlarged lymph nodes in the region of the internal thoracic artery (arrowhead) and in the axillae (arrows). One month later, an inguinal lymph node was excised. Pathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia and a polytypic plasmacytosis of the medulla and sinusoidal regions. On immunohistochemical studies for IgG and IgG4, a small fraction of the plasma cells were immunoreactive for IgG4. Four months before this evaluation, the patient was evaluated for a nonproductive cough, severe fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, diffuse aches, swelling of the right knee, and night sweats. Further weight loss (to 88.5 kg from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg) was noted. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two months before this evaluation, severe and increasing bitemporal headache developed. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported daily headaches and pain in her jaw when she chewed food. She did not report dry eyes or dry mouth. She had hypertension, anemia, and chronic left-knee pain after an injury that had occurred 6 years previously; she had undergone a hysterectomy and trigger-finger release. A tuberculin skin test that had been performed 2.5 years earlier was negative. Medications included budesonide, azathioprine, omeprazole, metoclopramide, and losartan. Naproxen caused a rash; she had no other known allergies or history of atopy. She was from the Caribbean, lived in a city in New England, and worked in a health-related field. She drank alcohol sparingly and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and her father had had colon cancer when he was 70 years of age. A daughter had systemic lupus erythematosus; her other three children and five siblings were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 35.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 178/96 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 165 cm, the weight 87.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.1. The upper eyelids were prominent, and the lacrimal glands were swollen bilaterally (Figure 2A). The temporal arteries were swollen, indurated, and nodular bilaterally, with strong pulses and no tenderness (Figure 2B). The sublingual glands were hypertrophic bilaterally. A nontender lymph node, measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension, was present in the posterior cervical chain. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a palpable spleen tip. Warm synovial effusions were present in the right knee and left ankle. The left ankle was tender, and there were areas of palpable and nonpalpable purpura on both legs (Figure 2C). The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, and alkaline phosphatase and results of renal-function tests were normal.

The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food. Two months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastroenterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen. A scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88% at 2 hours, 81% at 3 hours, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient\u2019s symptoms. During the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutritional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient described epigastric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esophagus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (\u226413 mm) in the stomach, particularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal (Figure 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (\u22645 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter), as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter). CT Scan of the Abdomen.CT was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial image (Panel A) shows wall thickening at the antrum (arrowhead) and secondary distention of the stomach (arrow). An additional axial image (Panel B) shows circumferential wall thickening at the incisura and pyloric canal (arrowhead). A coronal image (Panel C) shows the antral thickening (arrowhead) and gastric distention (arrow). A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the subsequent week, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On transfer to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diverticulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki\u2019s ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash. The patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of skin lesions, anemia, thrombocytosis, and an elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level. Eleven months before this presentation, the patient traveled abroad; she lived for 2 months in Morocco and then for 2 months in Thailand, and during that time, she also traveled briefly to South Korea. She returned to New England and was well until 5 months before this presentation, when a painful erythematous papule developed on her chin. During the next week, she felt feverish. More papules developed near the initial skin lesion and coalesced into a plaque. A similar, larger skin lesion developed on the right forearm, and a small amount of white fluid drained from it. The patient presented to her primary care physician at another hospital for evaluation. At the primary care clinic, the patient reported myalgias and occasional sore throat. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and the blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg. A 1-cm erythematous plaque with no ulceration was present on the left side of the chin, and a 1.5-cm lesion that was similar in appearance was present on the right forearm. Cephalexin was prescribed. Three days later, the skin lesions had not improved, and a new lesion had developed on the left forearm. The patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, the lesion on the right forearm was fluctuant. Incision yielded a small amount of bloody fluid; a culture of this fluid had no growth. A blood culture was also negative. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased echogenicity of the hepatic parenchyma (a finding suggestive of fatty infiltration) with no focal lesions of the liver. The gallbladder was normal, with no gallstones, and there was no dilatation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin were prescribed, and the patient was referred to a gastroenterologist because of the elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level. Laboratory Data. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported intermittent fatigue but no pruritus, abdominal pain, or arthralgias. Tests for antimitochondrial antibodies and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Results of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed that the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary systems, and size and contour of the liver were normal. The elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level was thought to be related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; weight loss was advised. The patient returned to the primary care clinic for follow-up after completing the 7-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin for treatment of the skin lesions. She reported that the lesions had decreased in size but continued to be painful. On examination, the lesion on the left forearm had resolved, and the lesion on the left side of the chin had decreased in size, flattened in appearance, and faded. The lesion on the right forearm remained erythematous and raised, with an overlying serous crust. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation. On examination in the dermatology clinic, there were well-demarcated, atrophic, depressed plaques on the left side of the chin. The appearance of the lesion on the right forearm was unchanged, and Gram\u2019s staining and culture of that lesion were negative. Cephalexin and topical clobetasol were prescribed. During the next week, the lesion on the chin recurred, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, a 2-cm circular, erythematous plaque was present at the site of the previous chin lesion, and the lesion on the right forearm had increased in size to 2 cm in diameter. A shave biopsy of the lesion on the chin was performed. Histologic examination reportedly revealed a perifollicular granulomatous and mixed inflammatory infiltrate that included neutrophils and eosinophils. No organisms were seen on periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining, Gram\u2019s staining, or staining for acid-fast bacilli. Doxycycline was prescribed. The patient traveled to Jordan and stayed for 4 weeks; during that time, the lesion on the left side of the chin receded, the lesion on the right forearm doubled in size, and the lesion on the left forearm recurred. Clusters of painful vulvovaginal ulcers developed; these waxed and waned. On her return to New England, the patient was referred by her primary care physician to an infectious disease specialist at this hospital. In the infectious disease clinic, the patient reported a 5-month history of waxing and waning skin lesions, a 2-month history of episodic vulvovaginal ulcers, and occasional nausea. She had a history of attention-deficit disorder. She took a combination birth control pill daily. Her father had diabetes mellitus, and her mother had hypertension and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient was of European descent. She was a graduate student and traveled abroad frequently for internships. While she was in Morocco 11 months earlier, she rode on a camel; while she was in Thailand, she petted an elephant and swam in freshwater waterfall pools. She had not visited farms or milked animals and had no known sick contacts. She had been sexually active for several years with one partner, who used condoms. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/52 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. On the left side of the chin, there was a 2-cm area of faded erythema with a depressed, atrophic plaque. On each forearm, there was a 5-cm, well-demarcated, depressed, atrophic plaque with no ulceration or crust. Two 2-mm ulcers were present on the right labium minus and vaginal fourchette. The remainder of the examination was normal. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative, as were tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The biopsy specimen from the left side of the chin that had been obtained 4 months earlier was reviewed at this hospital. Histologic examination of the shave-biopsy specimen revealed a granulomatous dermal infiltrate (Figure 1A) that was composed of macrophages and scattered giant cells arranged in loose clusters. Admixed neutrophils and eosinophils were also seen (Figure 1B). No microorganisms were identified on Gram\u2019s staining, periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining, staining for acid-fast bacilli, or Giemsa staining. These histologic features are consistent with the diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis, an entity that has numerous infectious and noninfectious causes. In this case, the shave-biopsy specimen consisted of only superficial dermis, and many of the features necessary for definitive pathological diagnosis were not present in the specimen. Given the presence of neutrophils, infection should be ruled out before noninfectious causes are considered. Skin-Biopsy Specimen from the Left Side of the Chin.Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows a granulomatous infiltrate in the superficial dermis (Panel A). At higher magnification, scattered neutrophils, eosinophils, and giant cells are seen (Panel B). Additional laboratory tests were performed; the results are shown inTable 2. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was ordered. Microbiologic Data. Four weeks after the patient was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital, fatigue and weakness developed in the left arm, along with associated numbness and tingling. The patient was evaluated in a clinic at this hospital, and the blood pressure could not be obtained in either arm despite multiple attempts at manual sphygmomanometry.

One month before the current evaluation, the patient, who lived in Panama, was seen at a primary care clinic in Colombia for a routine annual physical examination. He was in his usual state of good health, but because of a family history of cancer, he requested that imaging studies be obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a pulmonary nodule (measuring 12 mm by 13 mm) in the right middle lobe. Chest CT.Chest CT was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Images obtained in lung windows show a 12-mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe, abutting the major fissure (Panel A, arrow). The nodule has low attenuation and does not have calcification, macroscopic fat, or intense enhancement (Panel B, arrow). Normal-sized lymph nodes are present in the right hilum, subcarinal area, and right paratracheal region (Panels C and D, arrows). During the next month, follow-up testing was performed. The 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in a 24-hour urine specimen and the chromogranin A level in blood were reportedly normal, as were the results of pulmonary function testing and colonoscopy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (Figure 2) revealed FDG uptake in the right-middle-lobe nodule (measuring 14 mm in diameter), with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.8. There was also FDG uptake in multiple normal-sized right inferior paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes. A right hilar lymph node (measuring 8 mm in diameter) had a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7. PET Scan.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed. Intense FDG uptake is present in the right-middle-lobe nodule (Panel A, arrow) and in right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (Panels B, C, and D; arrows). The patient requested evaluation in the United States and was referred to the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog. The patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother. On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.1. He appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

In the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, andEscherichia coliO157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptosporidium, andClostridioides difficiletoxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. During the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient\u2019s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts. The patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash. The white-cell count was 10,690 per microliter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2020To convert the values for bilirubin to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.1. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed. On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation. Images Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.Images from upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy show two small, cratered ulcers located 30 cm from the incisors (Panel A) and diffuse mild gastritis (Panel B). Images from colonsocopy show no abnormalities in the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon (Panel C) but show a series of nonobstructing, large, dark-violet, protruding lesions farther into the sigmoid colon (Panel D); the mass becomes circumferential, and oozing blood is present (Panels E and F). When the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation. Initial Imaging Studies.Axial and coronal images from a CT scan (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained on hospital day 5, show multiple wedge-shaped areas of hypoenhancement in the kidneys, a finding consistent with ischemic lesions. Additional coronal images (Panels C and D) show an inflammatory pseudomass in the distal descending colon (arrows), with normal enhancement of the superior mesenteric vein and the portal vein (arrowheads). A coronal image from a CT angiogram of the chest (Panel E), obtained 3 days later, shows a large filling defect in a segmental branch of the right pulmonary artery (arrow), a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism. A right pleural effusion is also present. On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the bloodd-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when pain developed in the right posterior region of her throat, which she attributed to recent dental work. Two weeks later, she went to another hospital because of persistent pain; a throat specimen was obtained for culture and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed. The throat culture was reportedly negative for pathogenic bacteria. On evaluation by her primary care physician at a second hospital four days later, she reported severe pain in the right side of the throat and odynophagia. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and there was purulent exudate over the right tonsil and cervical adenopathy on the right side. A repeat throat culture grew normal flora. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was continued. Eleven days later (approximately 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms), the patient was seen by a rheumatologist at a third hospital for routine follow-up of her seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was receiving various immunosuppressive medications, including methotrexate, anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (anti\u2013TNF-\u03b1) agents, and prednisone. She also had diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recurrent aphthous ulcers and had had colon cancer in the remote past (which had reportedly been cured by partial bowel resection). She had no history of exposure to tuberculosis and had a negative purified protein derivative skin test. Medications at home included prednisone, methotrexate, infliximab, metformin, omeprazole, folic acid, and ferrous sulfate supplements, as well as acyclovir daily. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. There was prominent exudate at the right tonsillar bed and pain and decreased range of motion in her cervical spine and shoulders; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was advised to decrease her daily dose of prednisone, and planned doses of methotrexate and infliximab were withheld. The following day, on examination by her primary care physician, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C and there was persistent right tonsillar exudate. Azithromycin was prescribed. Laboratory Data. Three days later, the patient was seen in the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of persistent odynophagia. She reported pain on the right side of her throat, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), and headache. The pain did not radiate. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, malaise, or facial swelling. Otolaryngologic examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations that were consistent with broken vesicles on the right tonsil. The mucous membranes were moist and pink, the salivary secretions were clear, and the floor of the mouth and the tongue were soft and nontender on palpation. There was no trismus, erythema, or pus in the posterior pharynx. Endoscopic examination revealed minimally edematous turbinates in the nasal cavity, shallow ulcerations along the posterior tonsillar wall, and erythema of the right arytenoid complex with overlying shallow ulcerations to the midline. Oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen was administered. The patient returned home, with instructions to return for a follow-up visit in 1 week. Four days later, on repeat evaluation by her rheumatologist, she reported no relief in her throat pain and odynophagia, despite taking narcotic analgesic agents. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The right tonsillar bed and right posterior pharynx were ulcerated and covered with gray exudate. The otolaryngologist was contacted and recommended administration of a short course of prednisone at a dose of 50 mg per day. Three days later, she returned to the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary for a scheduled follow-up visit. She reported persistent pain, which she rated at 10 out of 10, and associated decreasing oral intake. On endoscopic examination, there was decreased exudate on the right tonsil as compared with the amount of exudate seen on the previous examination, as well as resolving mucosal lesions on the posterior oropharyngeal wall and substantial improvement of the mucosal lesion on the right aryepiglottic fold. Prednisone was continued at a dose of 50 mg daily for 5 days and then decreased to a dose of 10 mg daily, and viscous lidocaine mouthwash was added. One week later (2 weeks after her initial presentation at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary), the patient returned for follow-up in the emergency department, as advised. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C and the other vital signs were normal. The right tonsil had persistent ulceration and was firm on palpation. Fiberoptic otolaryngoscopy revealed a tonsillar mass and ulcer extending along the right pharyngeal wall to the aryepiglottic fold, as well as persistent white exudate over the right aryepiglottic fold. An appointment in the head and neck clinic was scheduled for 3 days later. In the clinic, the patient reported burning pain (which she rated at 10 out of 10), pain on swallowing, a globus sensation in the right side of her throat, weight loss of 4.5 to 5 kg since the onset of symptoms, and weakness. An ulcer extended along the right posterior pharyngeal wall to the larynx. The vocal cords were mobile and symmetric bilaterally. The following day, the patient was admitted to this hospital. Medications on admission included prednisone, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, omeprazole, glyburide, metformin, acyclovir, simvastatin, lisinopril, aspirin, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, calcium, and vitamin D. The patient was widowed and lived alone, with her adult children living nearby. She was born in South America and had last visited 15 years earlier. She had traveled to a rural area in New England 3 months before this admission and had worked in a garden in that area for several days. She had no exposures to sick people, pets, or other animals. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of head or neck cancer. The platelet count and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous fluids were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormally thickened and enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus, extending to the right palatine tonsil (Figure 1A). The thickened soft tissue continued inferiorly, involving the right lateral pharyngeal wall (Figure 1B), and extended to the right aspect of the epiglottis (Figure 1C) and the right aryepiglottic fold (Figure 1D). Asymmetrically prominent lymph nodes were present in the right side of the neck (Figure 1E). A few lymph nodes were slightly irregular, with hazy margins. CT Scan of the Neck.An axial, contrast-enhanced image obtained at the level of the palatine tonsils shows thickened, enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus (Panel A, arrows), extending to the right palatine tonsil (arrowhead), which is enlarged. A coronal image shows diffuse thickening of the right pharyngeal wall (Panel B, arrows). An additional axial image shows thickening of the right aspect of the epiglottis (Panel C, arrow) and of the anterosuperior edge of the aryepiglottic fold (arrowhead). At a more caudal level, there is diffuse thickening of the right aryepiglottic fold (Panel D, arrow). A coronal image shows prominent lymph nodes in the right side of the neck (Panel E, arrows); some of the nodes have slightly irregular and hazy margins (arrowheads). Glucose levels ranged from normal values to 263 mg per deciliter (14.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 67 to 106 mg per deciliter [3.7 to 5.9 mmol per liter]), and insulin was administered on a sliding scale, as needed.

personality changes, and odd behavior. Approximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient\u2019s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches. During the next few years, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient\u2019s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations. One year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife\u2019s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine were prescribed. The patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife\u2019s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members\u2019 workplaces and neighbors\u2019 homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances. Approximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the \u03b22-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia was established. Other medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders. On examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini\u2013Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function). Orientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter \u201cF\u201d over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter\u2013number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria\u2019s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, \u201cA train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.\u201d Judgment and insight were markedly impaired. An evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]). On neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word \u201cthing\u201d to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as \u201ca fenco type of thing.\u201d Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control. Visual memory was relatively intact, but verbal memory was impaired in terms of encoding and retrieval.

During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness. On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided. On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance. A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia. On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care. On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure. One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge.

The patient was pregnant with dichorionic, diamniotic twins, and her gestation was complicated by iron-deficiency anemia and hyperemesis. Approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation, mild pruritus of the palms and soles developed. At 32 weeks 5 days of gestation (16 days before this evaluation), the patient was afebrile, had no visible rash, and reported fetal activity; both fetal hearts were heard on auscultation. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A spot urinalysis revealed trace protein. A diagnosis of cholestasis of pregnancy was made, and ursodiol was administered. Four days later, at 33 weeks 2 days of gestation, the patient reported persistent itching, nausea, and occasional vomiting, along with a new pruritic rash on her abdomen that was thought to be consistent with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. The results of a biophysical profile that assessed fetal well-being were reassuring. The patient returned home. Laboratory Data. On the afternoon of the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics staff and reported that she had felt \u201ccrummy\u201d during the previous week and had noticed decreased fetal activity that day, with a maximum of four movements in 1 hour, despite hydration. She was advised to come to the labor and delivery triage unit for evaluation. On arrival, she reported nausea, decreased appetite, frequent urination (which was unchanged from baseline), subjective fevers, and chills; she did not report bleeding, dysuria, or loss of fluid. She also reported contractions that had occurred during the previous 2 days and had resolved spontaneously. The patient\u2019s medical history included the presence of the sickle cell trait, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and exercise-induced asthma, and she had had dysmenorrhea, a stress fracture of her left tibia,Clostridium difficileinfection after clindamycin use, and pancreatitis. Prenatal testing was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Her current medications were ursodiol, iron polysaccharide, a prenatal vitamin, doxylamine for sleep, ranitidine, and an albuterol inhaler. She was black and married and worked in the medical field. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She did not eat lunch meat or soft cheeses during pregnancy but noted that she consumed well-boiled hot dogs and frequently ate commercial-brand hummus. Her father had had deep venous thromboses; her husband did not carry the sickle-cell trait. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/71 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The two fetal heart rates were 140 and 150 beats per minute, with accelerations and moderate variability; no decelerations were noted. On tocodynamometry, uterine contractions were noted to occur every 4 minutes initially, and the frequency decreased to every 8 minutes after intravenous hydration. The platelet count and urinalysis were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A urine culture was obtained. Acetaminophen was administered, and the infusion of intravenous fluids and fetal monitoring were continued. The fetal heart patterns remained reassuring, and the patient reported increased fetal movement. She was discharged home later that evening and advised to monitor her temperature, to return in 2 days for an evaluation, and to call if symptoms worsened. Induction of labor was scheduled for 5 days after this evaluation. The next morning, the temperature was again 38.1\u00b0C, and the patient self-administered acetaminophen. She spoke with her obstetrician and was referred to the labor and delivery triage unit. On presentation, she reported feeling tired and ill and having nausea, loose stools, rigors, arthralgias, and myalgias. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C initially and rose to 38.4\u00b0C within 30 minutes after her arrival; the blood pressure was 133/71 mm Hg, and the pulse 75 beats per minute. The abdomen was nontender but was noted to be warm to the touch. The cervix was closed and soft, although the uterus was contracting intermittently. The two fetal heart rates were 170 and 180 beats per minute. There was 1+ leg edema. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Specimens of urine and blood were cultured. Rectal and vaginal swabs were obtained to screen for group B streptococcal colonization. Results of bedside ultrasonography confirmed that both fetuses were in the vertex position. Because the patient was thought to have chorioamnionitis, the decision was made to begin the induction of labor. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit, and ampicillin, gentamicin, and oxytocin were administered. During the course of the induction, cough and pleuritic chest pain developed. A chest radiograph was obtained. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed low lung volumes and patchy right basilar opacities that were thought to most likely represent atelectasis. Pneumonia could not be ruled out. Chest Radiograph.An anteroposterior chest radiograph that was obtained at the time of admission shows low lung volumes and patchy right basilar opacities that were thought to most likely represent atelectasis, although pneumonia could not be ruled out. Labor progressed slowly, despite artificial rupture of membranes. Approximately 15 hours after admission, a cesarean section was performed because of a nonreassuring heart-rate pattern in one of the fetuses, and two healthy infants were delivered.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admission, when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission, fever developed. On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever. Past treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated. Other medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home. There was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neurologic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney-function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed mucosal thickening with layering fluid levels in both maxillary sinuses, but the study was otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature. Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated, but the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 72% lymphocytes, 13% neutrophils, 11% monocytes, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed moderate ascites (Figure 1A) and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking (Figure 1B), findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The ovaries were normal in size, and the uterus appeared enlarged (Figure 1C). Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material approximately 6 weeks before the current evaluation, show moderate ascites (Panel A, arrow) and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking (Panel B, arrow), findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The uterus appears enlarged (Panel C, arrow). Seven days later and 5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology clinic at another hospital. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and cytologic examination of an aspirate of peritoneal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma, a finding that is most consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of a gynecologic origin. One week later and 4 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital. She had a history of colitis, hypertension, type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block, the sick sinus syndrome, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, atopy, chronic upper-airway cough syndrome, osteopenia, vitamin B12deficiency, and glaucoma and had undergone laparoscopy with salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy. Medications included oral budesonide, diltiazem, cetirizine, and probiotics and intramuscular cyanocobalamin. She had allergies to tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and latex; atorvastatin had caused elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The patient lived with her husband in a rural area of New England; she typically traveled to coastal New England during the summer but had not done so during the preceding year. She did not have pets. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the blood pressure 169/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 49.3 kg. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The vaginal mucosa was atrophic, the uterus was anteverted and mobile, and there were no cul-de-sac nodularities or adnexal masses. The anion gap and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Three days later and 3.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient underwent surgical exploration and cytoreduction for a presumptive diagnosis of m\u00fcllerian adenocarcinoma. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered preoperatively; phenylephrine, insulin, calcium chloride, fentanyl, hydromorphone, lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, albumin, and 3 units of packed red cells were administered during the procedure. Operative findings included approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid, tumor nodules in the splenic hilum and parenchyma and studding the right hemidiaphragm, replacement of the gastrocolic omentum by tumor, and obliteration of the cul-de-sac by a large pelvic mass invading and partially obstructing the rectosigmoid colon. Gastrocolic omentectomy, splenectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resections of the pelvic mass and rectosigmoid colon with primary reanastomosis, and plasma energy vaporization of tumor nodules on the right hemidiaphragm were performed. Resection specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. The primary resection specimen consisted of a 15.2-cm aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures that were firmly adherent one to another and contained a 15.0-cm irregular, firm, tan-white mass (Figure 2A). The cervix, the spleen, and portions of the omentum were submitted separately for examination. Microscopic examination revealed high-grade carcinoma in the ovaries, invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel (Figure 2B), and adjacent to the fallopian tubes (Figure 2C). The tumor was also seen adjacent to the uterine serosa and in the omentum, spleen, and mesentery of the transverse colon. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of pleomorphic cells with high mitotic activity (Figure 2D) and had slitlike spaces and psammomatous calcifications (Figure 2E). On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8 (Figure 2F) and negative for p53. The findings were consistent with high-grade carcinoma of m\u00fcllerian origin. M\u00fcllerian carcinoma may most recognizably originate in a pelvic organ, such as the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, but it may also be found multifocally in the peritoneum without clear evidence of a particular site of origin, as was the case with this patient. Specimen of the Resected Pelvic Mass.A gross photograph of the specimen of the resected pelvic mass shows an aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures containing a 15-cm tan-white, firm, ill-defined mass (Panel A). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections shows tumor in the right ovary (Panel B, right side), invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel (Panel B, left side), and present as a serosal nodule adjacent to the left fallopian tube (Panel C). The tumor consists of nests and cords of cohesive, pleomorphic cells with brisk mitotic activity (Panel D); these features are consistent with high-grade carcinoma. The tumor has slitlike spaces and psammomatous calcifications (Panel E). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells is diffusely positive for PAX8 (Panel F). The patient had persistent hypotension after surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, where phenylephrine and mechanical ventilatory support were continued. A right pneumothorax was managed with chest-tube placement. On the first day after surgery, the trachea was extubated. The next day, phenylephrine was discontinued, 2 units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was transferred to the inpatient unit, where the chest tube was removed 1 day later. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, Y, and W), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, andHaemophilus influenzaetype b conjugate vaccine were administered. On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three days after discharge and 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital for follow-up. She was thought to be recovering well, and the staples were removed from her surgical incision. A plan was made to schedule chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin at the other hospital. Eighteen days after discharge and 1 day before this evaluation, the patient returned to the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic because of fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. She had not yet begun chemotherapy. She reported that abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements had been present since surgery and that the night before this presentation, she had tried medical marijuana, which she had obtained from a friend, as a treatment for pain before going to sleep. When she awoke 14 hours later, she felt drowsy and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal imaging was performed. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes that had occurred since she had undergone the peritoneal cytoreduction, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, splenectomy, and rectosigmoid colon resection. Ascites had decreased, and only trace residual perihepatic fluid was present (Figure 3A). No abscesses were identified. There was no evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes of the bowel (Figure 3B), and the rectosigmoid anastomosis was unremarkable in appearance (Figure 3C).", "true_dx": "Transfusion-related

and abdominal pain. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before presentation, when his parents noted that he began to have intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. During these episodes, some of which woke the patient from sleep, he cried and pulled his legs up toward his chest while lying on his back. His parents reported that they palpated his abdomen during some of the episodes and it felt rigid; they suspected that he might be having discomfort related to excessive intestinal gas. He continued to eat and drink normally without vomiting. The next day, the patient had two bowel movements, and the stools had reddish discoloration. With the first bowel movement, the redness seemed to be present in a small amount and only on the outside of the stool; with the second bowel movement, the amount of redness increased. The patient\u2019s mother attributed the stool discoloration to beet consumption, since bowel movements with reddish stools had also occurred in the past after the patient had eaten beets. Intermittent episodes of apparent abdominal pain continued, and between the episodes, the patient behaved normally. On the morning of presentation, he had a third bowel movement with reddish stools. His parents took him to day care, where he continued to have occasional periods of crying and pain, followed by a bowel movement that appeared to consist almost entirely of blood, including a large clot. After this bowel movement, he was reportedly pale and diaphoretic. The day care provider called the patient\u2019s mother, who picked him up and took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 178 beats per minute, the blood pressure 95/52 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.1 kg. On palpation of the abdomen, there was diffuse tenderness, which was greater on the right side than on the left, and no masses. There were no external anal fissures, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Two hours after arrival at the other hospital, the patient passed a dark-red stool that was described as resembling currant jelly. Intravenous normal saline (5 ml per kilogram) was administered, and he was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient had a history of infantile colic and gastroesophageal reflux, which had previously been treated with ranitidine. He received a low-lactose cow milk\u2013based formula. Pureed fruits and vegetables had recently been introduced into his diet, after which constipation developed, his stools became more firm, and daily bowel movements were associated with straining. He received cholecalciferol, and he had begun using an unspecified over-the-counter teething gel and unspecified homeopathic teething tablets 1 week earlier. Immunizations were current through 4 months of age; vaccines (including the second dose of live, oral human\u2013bovine reassortant pentavalent rotavirus vaccine) had been administered 6 weeks earlier. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his parents, attended day care, and had no known sick contacts. His parents were from Brazil; he was born in the United States and had not traveled outside the country. There was no family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared well. Bowel sounds were present; the abdominal examination was otherwise limited because the patient was crying. The diaper contained melena and a small amount of stool. The remainder of the examination was normal. Thirty-five minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, an ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed. There was no evidence of intussusception, appendicitis, a focal lesion, or abnormally dilated bowel loops. Bowel peristalsis was present. On examination after ultrasonography, the pulse was 168 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/36 mm Hg. The patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses, and bowel sounds were present. Results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the anion gap, platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests.

At the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grandfather, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying. The patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which occurred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the patient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he received tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his maternal grandfather had died of acute coronary syndrome at 30 years of age. On evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until approximately 18 months earlier, when a diffuse, pruritic rash developed. During the next year, the rash progressed to total-body erythema. A diagnosis of psoriasis was made; topical glucocorticoids and oral cephaloridine were administered, without improvement. Five months before admission, the rash worsened. On examination at another facility, there was reportedly an extensive erythroderma of the extremities that was thought to be psoriasis; prednisone was administered orally. Shortly thereafter, fever and leg swelling developed, and the patient was admitted to another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, and the pulse 145 beats per minute. Over the extremities was a diffuse, scaly, erythematous rash with a small amount of serous drainage, and there was warm, nonpitting edema of the legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and B-natriuretic peptide were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function; tests for rheumatoid factor, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen of the left leg showed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis, as well as a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis, features suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction. A diagnosis of psoriasis complicated by cellulitis was made, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and prednisone were administered. Cultures of the skin grew methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus,and cultures of the blood were sterile. Fevers resolved, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day, taking dicloxacillin (10-day course, orally) and topical glucocorticoids. Laboratory Data. During the next 4 months, the erythroderma persisted, with intermittent exacerbations attributed to cellulitis. Three months before admission to this hospital, while the patient was taking trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, urticaria developed, associated with peripheral-blood eosinophilia. Levels of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate were normal; testing for antibodies toStrongyloides stercoralis(IgG), tissue transglutaminase antibody, and IgA endomysial antibody were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. The administration of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped, and prednisone and topical glucocorticoids were restarted, with improvement in the urticaria. Eight days before admission, fever to a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C developed, with worsening pruritus, erythema, and swelling of both legs. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. On examination, there was diffuse erythroderma and left axillary lymphadenopathy. Oxacillin, mupirocin ointment, and triamcinolone cream were administered. Blood cultures were sterile. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal; testing for antibodies to SSA (Ro), SSB (La), filaria, trichinella, and cysticercus was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. A hematologist noted very few of what were possibly S\u00e9zary cells on a peripheral-blood smear. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells for theBCR, ABL, CHIC2, PDGFRA,andFIP1L1gene regions was normal, and no clonal rearrangement of T-cell\u2013receptor genes was detected. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1) after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material revealed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (\u22643 cm in the short axis), bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (\u22644 cm), bilateral small pleural effusions, and stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the pelvis, features consistent with the history of bilateral leg edema. No mediastinal, hilar, or intraabdominal lymphadenopathy was identified. CT Images of the Chest and Pelvis from the Other Hospital.Selected images from CT scans of the chest (Panel A) and pelvis (Panel B) show axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy (arrows), as well as subcutaneous edema of the pelvis (arrowhead). Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of an axillary lymph node revealed small lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of an abnormal lymphocyte population. On the eighth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included doxepin, hydroxyzine, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, and lorazepam, with topical triamcinolone and mupirocin. The patient reported pain with walking, diffuse itching, dizziness, weakness, occasional diaphoresis and shaking chills, weight gain of approximately 9 kg in the previous 2 weeks, and chronic headaches. She had no history of blood transfusions. She was allergic to aspirin (angioedema). She was born in Puerto Rico and had moved to the Boston area 5 months earlier to live with relatives and seek medical attention. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of heart disease, her mother had Alzheimer's disease and pancreatic disease, and two nieces had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 126 beats per minute; the respirations and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse confluent erythroderma with superficial scaling and erosions, foci of lichenification, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and follicular prominence on the back (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C). There was madarosis, bilateral small ectropion of the eyelids, and painful pitting edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for syphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen from the left leg showed changes consistent with an eczematous process. Examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node showed dermatopathic lymphadenitis; flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations. Flow cytometry on a specimen of peripheral blood showed 35% T cells with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 10, with 7% CD3+CD7\u2212 cells, which also expressed CD4, and normal expression of other antigens (see Fig. 1A in theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Clobetasol ointment and urea (40%) cream were applied topically, with some improvement. Examination of skin-biopsy specimens of the left and right legs, obtained on the sixth day, showed eczematous and interface dermatitis, dyskeratotic cells, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The patient was discharged later that day. Clinical Photographs of the Patient.There is diffuse erythroderma, alopecia, and edema before treatment (Panels A, B, and C). The erythroderma cleared after three cycles of extracorporeal photopheresis, but after the fourth cycle, new scaly plaques developed (Panels D and E). During the next year, the patient had persistent erythroderma, progressive alopecia, and recurrent infections requiring hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics, topical glucocorticoids, and intermittent high-dose prednisone. Further evaluation included extensive patch testing, which revealed no positive allergens, and multiple additional skin biopsies, which were nondiagnostic. Test results from this period are shown inTable 1; other tests for autoantibodies were negative, and levels of tryptase, IgG, and IgA were normal, as were the results of other screening tests. Eleven months after the patient's initial admission to this hospital, pain and swelling developed around an intravenous catheter site while she was receiving nafcillin intravenously and taking oral prednisone (60 mg) daily, and she was readmitted to this hospital. The catheter was removed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Cultures of the blood were negative.

Approximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued. Four months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter). Four days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed. Blood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.

Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft. Imaging Studies.A radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung (arrowhead) and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung (arrow). Doppler ultrasound images targeting the renal allograft (Panels B through E) show normal renal parenchyma with a trace amount of perinephric fluid (Panel C, arrow) and patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but show elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. CT images of the chest (Panels F and G), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show confluent consolidation with air bronchograms in the lower lobes of both lungs (arrowheads), as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes and the right middle lobe (arrows). A CT image of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel H), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant (arrow), along the renal allograft. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive forStreptococcus pneumoniaein four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally.

On the morning of admission, tachycardia was noted and vomiting increased. On examination at the pediatrician's office, the patient was pale, with mottled skin; the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C. He was referred immediately to the emergency department of a second hospital. On examination, the weight was 3.61 kg, the rectal temperature 38.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/63 mm Hg, the pulse 172 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 64 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. He was pale, listless, and fussy, with mild suprasternal and intercostal retractions, without grunting or nasal flaring. The remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed dark red, cloudy urine, with a pH of 7.0, a specific gravity of 1.015, a large amount of blood, 100 mg per deciliter of protein, and trace leukocyte esterase by dipstick, as well as 0 to 5 red cells and white cells per high-power field and a small amount of bacteria, a moderate number of epithelial cells, and 15 to 20 granular casts per low-power field. Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and a bolus of normal saline were administered intravenously, and a transfusion of leukocyte-depleted, packed red cells (type O, Rh-negative) was begun. Less than 4 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital; en route, clindamycin, crystalloid solution, and the remainder of the red-cell transfusion were administered intravenously, and oxygen was given through a nasal cannula. Laboratory Data. The patient had previously been well, consuming both breast milk and formula. He lived with his parents, his twin, and an older sibling in a suburban, forested neighborhood, where the mother frequently walked. Approximately 2.5 months before the admission, the parents had vacationed on an island off the coast of Massachusetts; years earlier, they had visited the Caribbean, which has been their only international travel. The parents reported that they recently had upper respiratory tract symptoms; the family had a pet dog. On examination, the patient was crying vigorously and had pale and mottled skin. The temperature was 39.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 101/69 mm Hg, and the pulse 176 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 68 breaths per minute, with supraclavicular, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing 1 liter of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The anterior fontanelle was soft and flat, and there was no scleral icterus. A holosystolic-flow murmur, grade 2/6, was heard. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention, and the spleen was palpated 2 to 3 cm below the costal margin. The arms and legs were mottled and slightly cool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, ionized calcium, and creatine kinase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema, and a hazy opacity in the left upper abdomen, a finding consistent with splenomegaly (Figure 1). Results of ultrasonography of the head were normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal for the patient's age, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right shunting. Radiograph of the Chest and Abdomen.An anteroposterior chest and abdominal radiograph obtained on admission shows perihilar vascular congestion, a finding consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is normal. The bowel-gas pattern in the abdomen is normal, and a homogeneous haziness overlying the left upper abdomen is consistent with splenomegaly.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before this transfer, when a dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue developed. Two days later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the emergency department at a local hospital. The temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 94/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, he appeared well, and the lung sounds were clear. The white-cell count was 5600 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,500); 56% of the cells were neutrophils and 33% were lymphocytes. A nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to the Massachusetts State Laboratory for nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed owing to a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small (1 to 1.5 cm in diameter), rounded central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Imaging Studies of the Chest.An axial CT image (Panel A), obtained without intravenous contrast enhancement during the initial emergency department presentation, shows scattered, confluent central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs. A radiograph (Panel B) obtained on admission to the intensive care unit shows extensive confluent parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The endotracheal tube is 7 cm above the carina, prompting subsequent adjustment; the central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein is in an appropriate position, terminating in the superior vena cava, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Sternal wires and right shoulder arthroplasty from the patient\u2019s previous surgeries are visible. Oseltamivir was prescribed for the empirical treatment of influenza, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department and instructed to self-quarantine at home. During the next 4 days, his symptoms persisted; when dyspnea developed, he contacted his primary care physician and was referred back to the emergency department at the local hospital. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/91 mm Hg, the heart rate 108 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed; auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Intravenous propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to an academic health center in Boston for further evaluation and management of symptoms. On the patient\u2019s arrival at the academic health center, his family was available to provide information regarding medical history, surgical history, and a recent review of systems by telephone. The review of systems was negative for conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, anosmia, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, and edema. The patient\u2019s status with respect to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was unknown. His medical history was notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. He had undergone surgical aortic-valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis 1 year earlier; there had been no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on preoperative angiography. Radiofrequency ablation for recurrent atrial flutter had been performed 2 years earlier, and he had undergone right shoulder arthroplasty. Medications included metformin, insulin lispro, atenolol, losartan, and apixaban. Multiple statin medications had previously caused myalgia with elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was a health care worker but had no known sick contacts. No family members were ill. He had not traveled recently or had other environmental exposures. He did not use tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in multiple relatives; there was no history of pulmonary disease. The patient was admitted to a dedicated Covid-19 ICU at the academic health center. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 410 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The patient was sedated. There was no jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the chest revealed a tachycardic rhythm with no murmur and coarse breath sounds with rhonchi in both lungs. His arms and legs were cool and clammy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Catheters were placed in the right internal jugular vein and the left radial artery. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The partial-thromboplastin time and blood levels of phosphorus and magnesium were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for nucleic acid testing for the detection of community-acquired respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Figure 1B) showed extensive confluent central and peripheral parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein was in an appropriate position. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, PR-segment deviations (a depression in lead II and an elevation in lead aVR), and a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 425 msec. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, as well as dysfunction of the right ventricular free wall and the apex (seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). These findings were new relative to an echocardiogram that had been obtained 2 months earlier as part of routine surveillance after aortic-valve replacement, that had shown normal biventricular function. The size of the left ventricular chamber was normal. There was mild symmetric thickening of the left ventricular wall (12 mm; normal thickness, \u226411), a finding that was unchanged from the previous echocardiogram. No evidence of pericardial effusion was observed, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was well seated and appeared to be functioning normally. Electrocardiograms.An electrocardiogram obtained on presentation to the academic health center (Panel A) shows normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, and PR-segment depression in lead II and PR-segment elevation in lead aVR. Territorial ST-segment elevation raises the possibility of a coronary occlusion, but PR-segment deflections may indicate pericardial irritation, possibly consistent with myopericarditis. The corrected QT (QTc) interval is 425 msec. A repeat electrocardiogram obtained 4 hours after presentation (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm with persistent ST-segment elevations in leads I and aVL, with broad inverted T waves in those leads as well, and occasional ventricular ectopic beats that probably originate from the right ventricle. The QTc interval is 462 msec. An electrocardiogram obtained on the third hospital day (Panel C) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 135 beats per minute, as well as persistent ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL; the QTc interval is approximately 475 msec. An electrocardiogram obtained on the seventh hospital day (Panel D) shows normal sinus rhythm, with reduced ST-segment elevations in the lateral leads; however, regional T-wave inversion and a reduction in R-wave voltage in lead aVL are present, findings that could be consistent with transmural necrosis.", "true_dx": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and suspected myopericarditis.", "pred_dx": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)", "correct": true, "sentences": [{"s": "<|im_start|>assistant", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's tackle this case.", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The patient is a 73-year-old man with a recent onset of cough, fever, and fatigue.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He was admitted to the ICU in March 2020 during the pandemic, so SARS-CoV-2 is a big consideration here.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His initial presentation in the ER showed ground-glass opacities on CT, which are classic for viral pneumonias, including COVID-19.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The fact that he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 but also got oseltamivir for influenza empirically because of swab shortages might have delayed the correct diagnosis.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Looking at his lab results, the white cell count was initially normal but on admission to the ICU, it's elevated with a very high neutrophil percentage (82%) and low lymphocytes (11.4%).", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Lymphopenia is a common finding in COVID-19.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The elevated CRP, ferritin, LDH, and d-dimer all point towards a systemic inflammatory response, which is seen in severe cases of COVID-19.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The chest X-ray showing confluent opacities also aligns with the typical bilateral pneumonia seen in the disease.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His ECG changes are interesting.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The ST elevations in I and aVL could suggest myocardial injury, but the PR segment changes might indicate pericarditis.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The elevated troponin T (4.19 ng/ml) is a red flag for myocardial damage, which can occur in severe infections, including COVID-19.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The echocardiogram showing global left ventricular hypokinesis and right ventricular dysfunction could be due to myocarditis or the systemic effects of severe infection.", "t": 4, "c": "0", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "However, given the context of respiratory failure and the pandemic timing, it's more likely that the cardiac issues are part of the multi-organ involvement from SARS-CoV-2.", "t": 6, "c": "9", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He has comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, which are known risk factors for worse outcomes with COVID-19.", "t": 5, "c": "6", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The fact that he's a healthcare worker might increase his exposure risk, even without known sick contacts.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The absence of other specific pathogens (since tests for influenza and RSV weren't done due to shortages) makes me lean more towards the diagnosis that was being tested for initially, which is SARS-CoV-2.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The progression from mild symptoms to acute respiratory failure over days is also consistent with the disease course of severe COVID-19.", "t": 2, "c": "3", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Putting it all together: the imaging, lab markers, clinical course, and the time period all point to SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to severe pneumonia and possibly cytokine storm contributing to the elevated inflammatory markers and cardiac involvement.", "t": 6, "c": "9", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The diagnosis should be COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible myocardial injury.", "t": 6, "c": "9", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "<answer>", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)", "t": 6, "c": "9", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "</answer>", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}]}, {"id": "5f4f88c97f68b24eff3e32467a5f462a", "qid": 103, "prompt": "A 37-year-old woman was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for adult-onset psychosis. The patient had been healthy and studying for a doctoral degree when she began having symptoms of psychosis. Her first symptom was a belief that \u201cpeople were talking about her\u201d as part of a larger \u201cconspiracy\u201d in which family, friends, and random people were part of a \u201cgame\u201d and acting out \u201cscenes\u201d for her. She had had stress associated with her schooling and had contemplated changing schools. However, she had not had other symptoms of anxiety or depression, neurovegetative symptoms, or auditory or visual hallucinations. A few months later, the patient\u2019s apartment was burglarized and vandalized; her parents were the only other people with a key, and she believed they were involved. Because of threats she made against family members, she was admitted to an inpatient state psychiatric facility. A diagnosis of psychotic disorder, possibly paranoid schizophrenia, was rendered. An evaluation for causes of the disorder revealed evidence of marked iron-deficiency anemia, including an iron level of 18 \u03bcg per deciliter (3 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 45 to 182 \u03bcg per deciliter [8 to 33 \u03bcmol per liter]), a ferritin level of 6 ng per milliliter (reference range, 11 to 306), and a transferrin saturation of 3.7% (reference range, 11.0 to 50.0). The evaluation also revealed vitamin deficiencies, including a vitamin B12level of 167 pg per milliliter (reference range, 182 to 803) and a vitamin D2level of 10 ng per milliliter (reference value, >32). Before admission to the state psychiatric facility, the patient had had no history of psychiatric disease. She had a remote history of a left-foot fracture and had undergone a right oophorectomy at 17 years of age for torsion of the ovary. She took no medications. Her mother recalled her being a \u201cperfectionist,\u201d especially during her late teenage years. The patient had reported an unintentional weight loss of 9 kg over an unspecified period of time, despite self-described polyphagia and some hair thinning. She did not have diarrhea. There was no history of head injury or seizure, menopausal symptoms after the oophorectomy, or social withdrawal. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, her sister had hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, her maternal grandfather had diabetes, and an aunt had breast cancer. There was no family history of psychiatric disease. The patient had been previously employed in human resources and had lived alone. She had traveled to the southern United States, coastal Massachusetts, and New York City but not abroad. She followed a pescatarian diet that included dairy foods and an egg daily as part of a lunch salad. She drank one alcoholic beverage per month, did not smoke cigarettes but had used marijuana, and drank two caffeinated beverages daily. After a 1-month inpatient stay at the state psychiatric facility, the patient was discharged. Her medications included risperidone, sertraline, ferrous sulfate, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, and a multivitamin. At a routine follow-up visit 6 weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated by an internist at her primary care physician\u2019s office, who found her to be excessively thin. On examination, a thyroid nodule was identified, which prompted consultation with an endocrinologist. A biopsy of the nodule was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine ablation was suggested, but the patient opted for total thyroidectomy. After the thyroid surgery and despite the administration of escalating doses of oral levothyroxine, the patient\u2019s thyrotropin level reportedly remained high (value not available) and the free thyroxine level was 0.73 ng per deciliter (9 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.80 ng per deciliter [10 to 23 pmol per liter]). Several weeks later, after further dose escalation of levothyroxine, the free thyroxine level was 0.80 ng per deciliter (10 pmol per liter). A limited follow-up examination that was performed by the endocrinologist 6 months after the initial consultation revealed a height of 167.6 cm, a weight of 45 kg, and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 16.1. The patient was afebrile and had a regular pulse of 75 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg. The thyroidectomy scar was well-healed, and the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. However, the patient\u2019s psychiatric symptoms were believed to be poorly controlled by antipsychotic medications, and it was unclear whether her thyroid conditions were related to her psychosis.

Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Images Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.A coronal image from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel A) shows a nodule (arrow) in the paramediastinal apical segment of the upper lobe of the left lung that measures 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm. An axial image from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel B) shows bulky left hilar and left paratracheal mediastinal lymphadenopathy (arrows), with lymph nodes measuring up to 2.9 cm in diameter. An axial image from a positron-emission tomographic\u2013CT fusion scan (Panel C) shows intense radiotracer uptake (arrows) that corresponds to the lymphadenopathy. An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma. Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis. When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker. The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.

CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal. Images Obtained on Current Admission.A coronal image in lung windows from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel A) shows a radiologically significant increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measures 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm. There is new mixed ground-glass opacification and cavitation in the peripheral left upper lobe (arrow). An axial image in soft-tissue windows from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel B) shows enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter, as well as new right hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow), with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.9 cm in diameter. An axial image in soft-tissue windows from CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel C) shows multiple new rim-enhancing lesions involving all segments of the liver. The largest lesion (arrow), in liver segment 8, measures 8.0 cm in diameter. There is also a new lesion (arrowhead) in the body of the left adrenal gland that measures 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged. One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true. The next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long-standing belief that his doctors had administered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma to make money.", "true_dx": "Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from small-cell lung cancer.", "pred_dx": "Ectopic aldosterone secretion (EAS) due to small-cell lung cancer", "correct": true, "sentences": [{"s": "<|im_start|>assistant", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's tackle this case.", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) that was diagnosed six months prior.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He didn't follow up with treatment and instead pursued alternative therapies.", "t": 1, "c": "17", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now he's presenting with hypokalemia, paranoia, and some behavioral changes.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "First, the key points: SCLC is known for paraneoplastic syndromes.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hypokalemia here is a big clue.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "What causes hypokalemia in cancer?

The patient had been well until approximately noon on the day of admission, when a dull, diffuse headache developed; the pain gradually increased in severity until he rated it at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He took ibuprofen, and the headache improved but did not resolve. Between 6 and 7 p.m., he smoked marijuana. At approximately 7 p.m., a friend noted that the patient suddenly leaned forward and held his head in his hands. He then stood and was noted to have heavy breathing and unintelligible speech. He appeared to be frustrated by his inability to communicate. His friends brought him to the emergency department of this hospital; he arrived at 7:43 p.m. On arrival, the patient was unable to name the place or date. He reported that he felt confused and had difficulty thinking of and saying words; he rated the headache at 3 out of 10. He reported no recent trauma, neck pain, fever, chills, chest pain, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had sickle cell anemia, which was monitored at another hospital. It was associated with infrequent crises, the most recent of which had occurred more than a year earlier; his most recent blood transfusion had occurred 22 months before this evaluation. He had been hospitalized for pain crises in the past and for the acute chest syndrome once, 6 years earlier. He had had recurrent headaches during the past 15 months; evaluation at another hospital had revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms, which were reportedly stable on serial imaging studies. He had undergone a cholecystectomy at 12 years of age. His medications included ibuprofen, as needed for headaches, and folic acid. He had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with a friend. He smoked marijuana regularly, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not smoke tobacco or use other illicit drugs. His parents were of African-American ancestry. His biologic father\u2019s medical history was not known; his mother and two of his three half siblings had the sickle cell trait, his mother and her half brother had had myocardial infarctions and her half brother had also had seizures, a maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and a maternal great uncle had reportedly had an aneurysm. There was no known family history of stroke or brain tumors. On examination, the patient was alert and cooperative. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 108/51 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was conjunctival and sublingual icterus. On neurologic examination, his speech fluency was fair, with occasional paraphasic errors, mild anomia, and circumlocution. Comprehension and repetition of spoken language were almost normal, but he had severe alexia and agraphia. He followed simple commands but confused left and right. He identified individual fingers by name but was unable to perform simple arithmetic, which had previously been easy for him. Perseveration occurred when he attempted to copy alternating geometric shapes. On a test of object recall, he was able to recall none of three objects after 1 minute. On a test of semantic fluency, he was able to name four animals in 1 minute. On a test of phonemic fluency, he was able to name no words that begin with the letter F in 1 minute, and this testing resulted in tachycardia at a rate of 145 beats per minute. He had mild constructional apraxia, but praxis was otherwise intact. Coordination, gait, and cranial-nerve, motor, and sensory functions were normal, as were deep-tendon reflexes; the right plantar reflex was mute, and the left was flexor. He had a score of 3 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe deficit. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes and with a J-point elevation in the anterior leads. Urinalysis revealed trace occult blood, with 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, a few bacteria, and a few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin per low-power field. Screening of the urine for toxins revealed cannabinoids. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with a negative antibody screening. Crystalloid fluids were infused intravenously, and oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Laboratory Data.

Approximately 6 years before this presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which had been made by a rheumatologist at another hospital. Two years before this presentation, the patient had had a sudden onset of pain on the right side of the lower back and buttock, with hypoesthesia and weakness in the right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lumbosacral disk protrusion at L5\u2013S1, with moderate-to-severe foraminal encroachment on the right side. Needle electromyography revealed evidence of L5 radiculopathy on the right side. Neurosurgery consultants recommended physical therapy, and two glucocorticoid injections were administered, which improved symptoms. However, 2 months later, electromyography revealed persistent active L5 radiculopathy on the right side that had not improved since the previous study had been obtained. Approximately 1.5 years before this presentation, the patient\u2019s rheumatologist reported that the patient had a persistent right foot drop and persistent tenderness of the paraspinal muscles. In addition, a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was made on the basis of the gradual onset of bilateral hand and wrist discomfort and hand paresthesias. Approximately 5 months before this presentation, the patient noted the onset of a cough that produced thin yellow sputum. During the next month, exertional dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing developed. Six weeks later (9 weeks before this presentation), the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. On examination, rhonchi and wheezing were noted; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A diagnosis of bronchitis was made, and an albuterol inhaler and azithromycin were prescribed. The patient was referred to an allergist, because there were concerns about allergic bronchitis. Laboratory Data. On evaluation by the allergist, epicutaneous and intradermal skin tests revealed no reaction to pollens, molds (including aspergillus), or dust mites. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 2.51 liters (77% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.03 liters (70% of the predicted value), and a ratio of FEV1to FVC of 83%; these results were interpreted to be indicative of a restrictive ventilatory defect. There was no improvement after the administration of a bronchodilator; a methacholine challenge was not performed. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) was 112 ppb (reference range, <25). Budesonide\u2013formoterol was prescribed. Two weeks later, the wheezing and cough had resolved. Repeat pulmonary-function testing revealed improvements, including an FEV1of 3.05 liters (94% of the predicted value), an FVC of 3.55 liters (82% of the predicted value), and a ratio of FEV1to FVC of 86%. The Fenohad decreased to 59 ppb. Ten days before this presentation, lethargy, myalgias, chills, headaches, anorexia, and night sweats developed. Nine days later, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician because of recurrent cough, night sweats, myalgia, and fatigue. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were described as harsh. A urinalysis was notable for the presence of microscopic hematuria; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Doxycycline was prescribed empirically for possible Lyme disease. The next day, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. He reported bitemporal headaches, and he described the pain as bandlike; the headaches had occurred intermittently at first and then constantly during the previous 3 days. He also reported associated neck stiffness and photophobia. He had a fever, aching of the jaw muscles with chewing, and diffuse aches, including joint pain of the hands, fingers, spine, hips, and knees. Nausea with one episode of emesis had occurred after he had taken a dose of doxycycline on an empty stomach; he took a total of three doses and then discontinued the medication when the serologic test for Lyme disease was reported as negative. He had no weight loss, vision changes, or other cardiac, pulmonary, joint, ocular, or neurologic symptoms. The patient had undergone surgery for knee osteoarthritis, had received physical therapy and glucocorticoid injections for rotator-cuff tendinopathies, and had had an appendectomy at 19 years of age. He had neck osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, sleep apnea, and peptic ulcer disease. He had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past. Medications included a budesonide\u2013formoterol inhaler. Allergies reportedly included aspirin, which was noted to cause tightness in the throat. The patient lived with his wife and worked in a health care facility, where he was exposed to patients and multiple sick contacts. He drank alcohol on social occasions; he had smoked two packs of cigarettes per week during college and smoked cigars intermittently thereafter. He had traveled to Florida 1 month before this evaluation and to Europe and the Caribbean during the previous 8 months; he had had no animal or insect exposures. His father had died at 54 years of age from complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus; his mother had had hypothyroidism and had died at 83 years of age from acute leukemia. A sister had systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. On examination, the temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared mildly ill. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There was no tenderness on the scalp or head. The neck was described as stiff. Inspiratory crackles were present in both lungs. There was mild synovial thickening in the hands, a finding consistent with chronic arthritic changes. There was no asymmetry on neurologic strength testing. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, and the IgE level was less than 5 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Portable chest radiography showed clear, well-inflated lungs. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed signs of chronic sinusitis, including opacification and wall thickening in the frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Because of the persistent headache and neck stiffness, a lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. Analysis of the CSF revealed a nucleated-cell count of 1 per cubic millimeter and a protein level of 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). (The glucose level was not checked, and the opening pressure was not recorded.) A Gram\u2019s stain of the CSF showed no polymorphonuclear cells or organisms.

His neck pain had developed at work. Examination of the neck had revealed trapezius muscle spasm; naproxen, acetaminophen, and cyclobenzaprine had been administered, and the pain partially decreased. He also had a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diverticulitis, lumbar disk disease, colonic polyps, ischial bursitis, chronic dyspepsia, nocturnal leg cramps, excessive alcohol use, and osteoarthritis of the shoulders, knees, and hips. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, calcium carbonate for dyspepsia, tamsulosin, n\u20133 fatty acids, glucosamine, and a multivitamin, as well as ibuprofen and naproxen for musculoskeletal symptoms and, as needed, tadalafil and disulfiram. He had no known medication allergies. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 31.2. The posterior neck and occipital region on the left side were tender but had full range of motion, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of glucose, thyrotropin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Examination of the urine revealed turbid yellow fluid that was otherwise normal; urine culture was negative. That evening, after results of the blood tests were known, the patient was contacted and asked to return the next day for additional testing. Laboratory Data. Approximately 26 hours after the initial laboratory tests, the additional testing was performed. The blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Eight hours later, when the test results were known, the patient was advised to go to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation of potentially life-threatening abnormalities, and he was subsequently admitted. In the emergency department, the patient reported residual stiffness of the neck. He had had an influenza-like illness (with subjective fevers, diaphoresis, and nasal congestion) approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation that resolved spontaneously, and he reported chronic constipation that was unchanged. He had stopped drinking alcohol 4 years earlier and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, had adult children, and worked in an office. His father and a grandfather had died of lung cancer, a grandmother had died of a stroke, his mother had died of liver disease, and an uncle had had pancreatic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 159/114 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of 101 beats per minute, a PR interval of 260 msec, a QRS complex of 136 msec, and a ratio of QT interval to QT interval corrected for heart rate of 318:412 msec; first-degree atrioventricular block and right bundle-branch block were present and had not been present 3 years earlier. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and degenerative changes of the spine. The platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, lactic acid, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, troponin T, andN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with a pH of 9.0, a specific gravity of 1.006, and 1+ occult blood by dipstick, as well as 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field; squamous cells were present. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material, revealed no evidence of cancer. CT of the chest revealed an indeterminate sclerotic lesion involving the right eighth rib (Figure 1). A radionuclide bone scan was recommended as a screening study for additional skeletal lesions. The bone scan revealed nonspecific abnormal uptake by the rib lesion and at the left ischium (Figure 2). Because there were concerns about cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was recommended for further evaluation and revealed a high-grade tear of the left common hamstring tendon at the ischial tuberosity attachment site. A fluoroscopically guided glucocorticoid injection had been performed at this location 11 months earlier. CT Scan of the Chest.A CT scan of the chest, obtained on hospital day 1, showed an indeterminate sclerotic lesion located at the anterolateral aspect of the right eighth rib (arrow).

Two months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospital with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1500). A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac and Radiographic Studies.An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at the other hospital (Panel A) shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at this hospital (Panel C) shows mild cardiomegaly that is unchanged from that observed on the image obtained at the other hospital, with increased pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter is appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. An image from three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (Panel D) shows severe mitral regurgitation (orange-red jet and asterisk) due to a perforation at the lateral mitral-valve annulus. This image shows the \u201csurgeon\u2019s view,\u201d with the aortic valve (AV) anterior to the mitral valve (white oval) and the lateral aspect of the mitral valve on the left side of the image. Subsequently, cardiac surgery was performed. An electrocardiogram obtained postoperatively (Panel E) shows atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained postoperatively while the patient was in the supine position (Panel F) shows left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with support catheters and tubes (endotracheal and orogastric tubes, bilateral chest tubes, a mediastinal drain, the tip of a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, and a peripherally inserted central catheter) and median sternotomy wires. Bilateral costophrenic angles were not included in the field of view. No evidence of pneumothorax was observed. At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus(MSSA) in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital. However, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Medical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypothyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furosemide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm. The blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albumin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative.

A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed bilateral pulmonary edema, which was more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, as well as pleural effusions and left atrial enlargement. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Figure 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61%, dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery. On hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine (at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute), norepinephrine (10 \u03bcg per minute), and vasopressin (0.04 U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Figure 1E) showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemodynamic data are shown inTable 1. An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1F) showed left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain. Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued. On postoperative day 2, the trachea was extubated, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%, right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (seeVideo 3).

emergency department of this hospital with chills and sudden worsening of abdominal pain in both lower quadrants. The patient was in her usual good health until 10 days before admission, when, after eating at a restaurant, she had nonbloody, nonbilious emesis that she attributed to food poisoning. The vomiting persisted for 2 days and then resolved. One day later, bilateral abdominal pain developed; the pain waxed and waned for a few days. She then completed a 2-day driving trip as part of her relocation to New England for a new job. During the trip, she had watery, nonbloody diarrhea every time she tried to eat (about four times per day). Her travel companion ate foods that were similar to the foods she ate but was well. After the patient arrived at her final destination, chills, fevers, and \u201csharp\u201d abdominal pain in both lower quadrants, with bloating, developed. She took naproxen every 8 hours for the pain and noted some improvement. She had minimal appetite, and she noted that the frequency of the diarrheal episodes decreased when her eating decreased. However, abdominal pain persisted and intensified until she rated it as 9 to 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Two nights later, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea, and chills. On arrival, the patient reported nausea and increased abdominal pain without further episodes of emesis. There was no hematochezia, melena, vaginal discharge, dysuria, or foul-smelling urine. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age. Her menstrual periods occurred in normal 30-day cycles; her most recent menstrual period had been 2 weeks before this presentation. She had had no known contact with persons who were ill. She had no chest, flank, back, or neck pain, no dyspnea, and no swelling or pain in the calves. She had not lost weight. The patient had a history of a 1-cm ovarian cyst, which had been identified during her early teenage years. She was of East Asian descent, had lived in the Midwest for the previous 10 years, and worked in a medical field. At presentation, she was taking no medications except naproxen, as well as ibuprofen for pain during menstruation. She had no known drug allergies. She did not smoke or use alcohol or illicit drugs. She had never been sexually active. Her father had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 129 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her body was well developed. She appeared to be uncomfortable except when she was lying flat. She appeared to be flushed, but there was no scleral icterus or rash. She had tachycardia, but the cardiac examination was otherwise normal. The abdomen was mildly distended, with tenderness in both lower quadrants that was worst in the midline; there was voluntary guarding on palpation but no rebound, and bowel sounds were diminished. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of magnesium and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Two sets of blood culture specimens and a urine culture specimen were obtained. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar opacities.

The patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. Clinical Photographs.Photographs of the patient\u2019s left hand show violaceous bullae on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth digit (Panel A) and the distal interphalangeal joint of the second digit (Panel B), each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Panel C). On further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the left hand and arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal soft-tissue swelling overlying the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger on the dorsal aspect of the left hand (Figure 2). There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging. Imaging Studies.CT of the left hand was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Sagittal images centered on the second digit and the fourth digit (Panels A and B, respectively) show focal soft-tissue swelling (arrows) overlying the second distal interphalangeal joint and the fourth proximal interphalangeal joint on the dorsal aspect of the hand. Coronal images centered on the second distal and fourth proximal interphalangeal joints (Panels C and D, respectively) show no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, or fluid collection. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the left hand (Panel E) also shows focal soft-tissue swelling (arrows) overlying the second distal and fourth proximal interphalangeal joints. A three-dimensional image of the bones (Panel F) shows no abnormal features. While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history. The patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well. Intravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 3 days before presentation, when epigastric distress and ankle edema occurred. He also reported increased personal stress, difficulty sleeping, dysgeusia, and nausea. On presentation in an outpatient clinic at this hospital, he reported epigastric pain that he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and no weight loss. He had a history of asthma, pain and effusion of the right knee associated with a Baker's cyst, occasional swelling of the right ankle, and varicose veins. He had had normal results on colonoscopy 3 years earlier. His medications were pirbuterol by inhalation as needed for asthma and sucralfate as needed for stomach discomfort; he reported no use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. He lived with his partner and worked in an office. He consumed two or three glasses of wine per night and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/68 mm Hg, the weight 81.8 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.8. There was pitting edema of the ankles and superficial varicosities of both legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were results of renal-function tests and blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase. Other test results are shown inTable 1and revealed a new anemia as compared with test results from 4 months earlier, which included a hematocrit of 42% and a mean corpuscular volume of 88 \u03bcm3. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed 1+ polychromasia and basophilic stippling (Figure 1). A diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, with possible peptic-ulcer disease and a bleeding ulcer. Omeprazole and sucralfate were administered, tests for blood in the stool and for antibodies toHelicobacter pyloriin the blood were ordered, an upper endoscopy was scheduled, and a bland diet was recommended. The patient was instructed to follow up in 3 days, or sooner if his condition worsened. Peripheral-Blood Smear (Wright\u2013Giemsa stain).Review of a peripheral-blood smear reveals several erythrocytes with coarse basophilic stippling (Panel A, arrows), as evidenced by punctate basophilic inclusions that are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Some red cells are enlarged, with a purplish hue (arrowheads); this polychromasia reflects increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes. A few nucleated red cells (Panel B, arrow) are also present. Laboratory Data. The next day, the patient called his doctor's office to report pain in both legs and increasing dysgeusia. He reported that his stools were looser than usual, without hematochezia or melena. The following day, 2 days after presentation, he was seen by his primary care physician in an outpatient clinic at this hospital. He reported increased abdominal pain, pain in the right knee and both shoulders, and fatigue that had lasted for at least 1 week. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/89 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the height 177.8 cm, the weight 80.3 kg, and the BMI 25.4. The abdomen was normal, and the right knee was tender on palpation, with a mild effusion and no erythema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Stool obtained during a rectal examination was negative for occult blood. The patient scheduled a follow-up visit and returned home. That night, the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain that was worse with eating and radiated to the left side of the chest, neck, shoulder, and back. Pain that was initially intermittent had become constant, and he had had constipation for 2 days. On examination, the blood pressure was 187/90 mm Hg; other vital signs, the oxygen saturation, and the remainder of the examination were normal. The blood level of lactic acid and results of coagulation tests were normal, and testing for antibodies toH. pyloriin the blood and for blood in the stool was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and was otherwise normal. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Oxycodone and ondansetron were administered. The patient was advised to avoid acetaminophen and alcohol, and he went home in the early morning hours. Later that morning, the patient returned to the hospital for an outpatient visit and rated the pain at 4 out of 10. He had hypoactive bowel sounds and periumbilical fullness, with no epigastric pain on palpation. The blood level of C-reactive protein was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and HIV antigen was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, upper endoscopic examination revealed a hiatal hernia, a nonobstructing Schatzki's ring at the gastroesophageal junction, and nodularity in the duodenal bulb. That evening, the abdominal pain markedly increased. The next day, 5 days after the patient's initial presentation, he returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported pain in the lower abdomen (rated at 8 out of 10), constipation that had lasted for 4 days, nausea with dry heaves, shortness of breath, and insomnia due to pain. On examination, he was tearful and writhing in discomfort. The temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The bowel sounds were hypoactive, and there was diffuse tenderness in both lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital by wheelchair. On examination, he appeared anxious and uncomfortable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, and he had discomfort on palpation in the lower quadrants. The blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, and routine toxicologic screening of the blood was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the abdomen revealed a dilated colon, with findings suggestive of stool in the right and transverse colon to a transition point in the proximal descending colon.

The patient was born at another hospital to a 25-year-old mother by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a full-term uncomplicated gestation. Results of prenatal ultrasonography at 19 weeks 6 days of gestation were reportedly normal. During labor, the mother\u2019s temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C, and meconium staining of the amniotic fluid was noted. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered. During delivery, meconium was suctioned with a bulb syringe from the infant\u2019s nose and mouth. The baby was limp and blue, without respiratory responses or reflexes. Suctioning of the trachea below the vocal cords produced copious meconium. Positive-pressure ventilation was administered. Spontaneous respirations were noted at 2 minutes but were labored, with retractions and grunting. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 6, respectively. The weight was 4775 g (99th percentile), the head circumference 39 cm (99th percentile), and the length 57 cm (100th percentile). The pulse was greater than 100 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Oxygen saturation at 4 minutes and 5 minutes of age was 78% and 86%, respectively, with the administration of 100% oxygen. Muscle tone improved within 30 minutes after birth. The infant was transferred to the neonatal special-care nursery while he was receiving continuous positive airway pressure. Severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia persisted; the infant was intubated, given surfactant (70 minutes after birth), and placed on mechanical ventilation. Passive cooling was initiated and then was stopped after neurologic status improved. Laboratory Data. Catheters were inserted into the umbilical artery and vein and a vein in the left hand. A blood specimen was cultured, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A bolus of normal saline was administered for hypotension. Morphine (at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight) and midazolam (at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram) were given for sedation because of dyssynchronous breathing and a respiratory rate of greater than 100 breaths per minute. The mean blood pressure ranged from 30 to 39 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation was 80 to 89% with the administration of 100% oxygen. Referral was made to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) transport team of this hospital. The infant was transferred by ambulance, arriving at this hospital approximately 6.5 hours after birth. During transport, the oxygen saturation was 99% with the administration of 100% oxygen. The infant\u2019s mother had previously had a miscarriage at 3 months of gestation and was otherwise well. Prenatal testing revealed that her blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening. Testing for syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, group B streptococcus colonization, hepatitis B virus, and chlamydia was negative. Her medications included iron and prenatal vitamins. She had not smoked, drunk alcohol, or used illicit drugs during the pregnancy. The maternal grandmother had had a brain aneurysm, and a maternal uncle had multiple skin tumors. There was no family history of early infant or childhood deaths, autism, or macrocephaly. The medical and family history of the child\u2019s father was not known. On initial examination, the infant was intubated and sedated but had spontaneous limb movements and was reactive to stimulation. The temperature was 35.2\u00b0C and rose when the infant was placed on an open warmer; the pulse ranged from 121 to 166 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 70 to 80 breaths per minute, with mild subcostal retractions. The head circumference was 41.5 cm (2 SD above the 98th percentile). The skin was pale, with petechiae on the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and had hypoactive bowel sounds. The left hand was edematous at the insertion site of a peripheral intravenous catheter. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. During the first day of life, boluses of intravenous fluids containing glucose were administered when blood glucose levels were between 10 mg per deciliter and 40 mg per deciliter; continuous intravenous administration of glucose was begun. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A chest radiograph showed pneumothorax on the right side, which was aspirated. Subsequent chest radiographs showed streaky perihilar opacities that were thought to be consistent with meconium aspiration. The temperature rose to 39.0\u00b0C; acetaminophen was administered, with improvement. The mean arterial pressure ranged from 38 to 57 mm Hg; dopamine and epinephrine were administered, and the doses were adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 45 mm Hg. Stress-dose hydrocortisone was also administered. Morphine was discontinued, and a continuous infusion of fentanyl was begun. Results of echocardiography confirmed elevation of the pulmonary-artery pressure, and therapy with inhaled nitric oxide was initiated, with improvement in oxygenation. Urine output decreased, and edema worsened. Gentamicin was discontinued because of concern about nephrotoxicity, and cefotaxime was begun. The blood levels of phosphorus and ionized calcium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Fresh-frozen plasma and irradiated, leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. On the fourth day, the patient remained lethargic despite the discontinuation of fentanyl and midazolam, but he had occasional spontaneous movements and a strong respiratory drive, with a respiratory rate of 36 to 56 breaths per minute. Test results are shown inTable 1. Infusions of water, glucose, and potassium chloride were administered. Urine output increased to 6 ml per kilogram per hour. Dopamine and epinephrine were tapered on the fourth day and stopped on the sixth day. The fontanelles were full but soft and not bulging. At the end of the sixth day, episodes of myoclonus occurred in response to external stimulation. A neurology consultation was obtained. Examination revealed severe eyelid edema, precluding assessment of pupils, gaze, and corneal reflexes; the face was symmetric, with normal tone. The patient moved his limbs in response to noxious stimuli. Reflexes were 3+ throughout, with clonus at both ankles (10 to 12 beats). Plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Stimulation induced fast irregular twitches in both arms and sporadically in both legs. Results of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, which was performed continuously overnight and captured episodes of twitching, were normal. During the next 2 days, the patient remained lethargic, with intermittent clonus. On the eighth day, the anterior fontanelle was full, and there was diastasis of the sagittal suture. There was no spontaneous eye opening or tracking when the eyes were opened. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and minimally reactive. Tone was decreased, and reflexes were 4/4 throughout. Whole-body clonus developed when patellar reflexes were elicited.

The patient had been well until 2 years before the current evaluation, when episodes of mild, nonproductive coughing developed and occurred multiple times daily. Between 13 months and 10 months before the current evaluation, three febrile illnesses occurred, with temperatures up to 38.9\u00b0C. After the third illness, the patient noted dyspnea with exertion. She was seen by her physician for an outpatient evaluation; a chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Oral azithromycin and combined inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol fumarate dihydrate were administered. Sixteen days after the outpatient evaluation, dyspnea worsened and was associated with fevers and chest congestion. On evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital, a chest radiograph reportedly showed pulmonary findings suggestive of possible scarring or consolidation; levofloxacin was administered. Ten days later, computed tomography (CT), performed according to a pulmonary emboli protocol, was reportedly negative. An echocardiogram reportedly showed normal left ventricular function and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Seven months before this evaluation, results of pulmonary-function tests were thought to be consistent with obstructive lung disease (Table 1). The level of \u03b11-antitrypsin was normal. During the next 4 months, the patient noted increased dyspnea while she was climbing stairs and walking fast. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were repeated (Table 1). Additional testing revealed allergies to shellfish, dust mites, oak, and birch. Results of Pulmonary-Function Testing. Twenty-seven days before this evaluation, the patient returned to her physician\u2019s office because of increasing dyspnea; albuterol (by nebulizer) and prednisone were administered. One week later, on examination by a pulmonologist at another clinic, the blood pressure was 147/96 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air at rest; the remainder of the examination was normal. Thirteen days before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were performed. The results are shown inTable 1. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the left lower lobe (involving the basilar segments of both lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the inferior lingular segment), with accompanying mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was a small focus of atelectasis or scarring in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, but the lungs otherwise showed no focal abnormality. There was a small hiatal hernia. The patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported increasing dyspnea and fatigue with mild exertion during the previous 3 months that had required rest after she walked one block or climbed one flight of stairs, as well as increasing frequency of upper-airway tightness and, for 4 days before this presentation, a productive cough with green sputum. She also had had fevers and weight loss of 2.5 kg during the previous month. She had hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, hypertensive disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and lichen sclerosus, and she had undergone a total knee replacement. She had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes weekly for 10 years as a young adult. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, montelukast, a multivitamin, and vitamin C (orally); albuterol and budesonide\u2013formoterol (by inhalation); betamethasone dipropionate ointment, clobetasol propionate ointment, and estradiol vaginal cream (by topical application); cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion; and fluticasone furoate nasal spray. She had no known allergies to medications. She was married and had two adult children and two dogs. She was a manager in a medical field and reported no known home or occupational exposures. She lived in a suburban area and had traveled to Europe several months earlier. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, her sister had the left ventricular noncompaction syndrome, and her children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/63 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. The lungs were clear, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, IgA, IgM, IgE, and \u03b11-antitrypsin were normal, as were results of testing for rheumatoid factor, tests of renal and liver function, and serum protein electrophoresis. Testing was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies and antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, Scl-70, Jo, Ro, La,Aspergillus fumigatus, A. pullulans, A. flavus, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, T. candidus, T. vulgaris, Micropolyspora faeni,and pigeon sera. Other test results are shown inTable 2. Laboratory Data. CT of the chest was performed (Figure 1), after the intravenous administration of contrast material, according to an interstitial lung disease protocol (which includes high-resolution scans obtained during inspiration and expiration and with the patient in the prone position). The scans showed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes and mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was no difference in the attenuation of the lung parenchyma on expiratory images, as compared with inspiratory images; this finding is suggestive of air trapping. On the expiratory images, there was no lobular or geographic heterogeneity in lung attenuation, a finding indicative of a diffuse process. Axial CT Scans of the Chest.Contrast-enhanced CT scans, obtained according to an interstitial lung disease protocol, show mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes, with trace accompanying bronchial-wall thickening (Panel A, arrows). There is no difference in lung attenuation between the inspiratory image (Panel B, circle; average attenuation, \u2212908 Hounsfield units) and the expiratory image (Panel C, circle; average attenuation, \u2212904 Hounsfield units), a finding indicative of diffuse air trapping. Eight days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, a bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right middle lobe and lingula revealed clear and colorless fluid, with three nucleated cells per microliter (34% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 6% eosinophils, and 32% macrophages or lining cells) and no evidence of pepsin A or galactomannan antigen. Cytologic examination revealed no viral cytopathic changes, fungal elements, or malignant cells. Gram\u2019s staining revealed very few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and cultures were negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. During the 11 days after the bronchoscopic examination, increased dyspnea occurred, with associated intermittent low-grade fevers. Test results are shown inTable 2. A chest radiograph showed a patchy right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis or aspiration. Albuterol (by nebulizer or by inhaler with a spacer) and a course of azithromycin were administered, and the patient\u2019s condition eventually returned to baseline. Thirty-four days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital, flexible bronchoscopic examination revealed prominent scarring between the arytenoids, marked inflammation in the subglottic space, scattered whitish secretions with marked airway inflammation throughout the trachea and right and left bronchial trees, and mild ectasia of the central airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the right and left lungs was submitted for microbiologic and cytologic examination and revealed no evidence of viral or bacterial infection.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before the current presentation, when a pruritic rash developed below the waist, most prominently on the left upper thigh. The rash was similar to transient rashes he had had in the past. Ten days before this presentation, he was seen in the urgent care clinic at this hospital for evaluation. On examination, there were pigment changes on the face and lower abdomen, scattered small papules involving the lower legs and wrists, purpura on the left thigh, and multiple scattered excoriations. A diagnosis of dermatitis was made, and he was referred to the dermatology clinic. On evaluation at the dermatology clinic the next day, he reported severe itching, including on his ears. He had not used any new soaps or detergents. On examination, there were geometric erythematous-to-violaceous patches and plaques, most notably on the abdomen under the belt buckle and on both legs in the location of the pants pockets, with depigmentation and prurigo nodules, and there was a low density of brown papules (2 to 4 mm in diameter) over the trunk and limbs that were consistent with benign nevi. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of severe contact dermatitis was made and was thought to be caused by coins or nickel on his clothing. A tapered course of prednisone was administered. Nine days later, at 4 p.m. on the day of admission, a headache developed in the patient that was unlike any pain he had had previously and that was associated with increasing agitation and restlessness. He self-administered ibuprofen, without improvement. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by his family. The history was obtained from the patient and his relatives. He rated his pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He reported photophobia and nausea, with no fever, neck stiffness, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, head trauma, or chest or abdominal pain. He had melasma and acne; he had had hidradenitis suppurativa and, during the previous 8 years, recurrent pruritic rashes predominantly around the waist and axillae that were associated with transient eosinophilia (910 cells per cubic millimeter [16%]; reference range, 100 to 300). Four years earlier, the patient had had a partial small-bowel obstruction and underwent resection of a Meckel's diverticulum. Medications included prednisone and hydroxyzine hydrochloride, as needed for itching. He had no known allergies to medications. Vaccination history was not known. He was born in the Dominican Republic, had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier, lived with his wife and children, and worked indoors in a service capacity. He spoke Spanish as his primary language. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He had visited the Dominican Republic 2 months before these symptoms occurred. On examination, the patient was oriented to person, place, and time and was agitated and tearful, holding his head, and moaning. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C to 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and briskly reactive to light. The neck was stiff, with pain on flexion and rotation. Strength was 4/5 bilaterally, the gait was unsteady, and he was unable to stand without assistance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium; other test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. A chest radiograph was normal. Blood specimens were cultured. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Laboratory Data. Lumbar puncture was performed. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown inTable 1. Gram's staining of the CSF revealed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes and very few gram-positive cocci in pairs. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, magnesium, and metoclopramide were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when she had nausea and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. She did not seek medical care, and her symptoms resolved after several hours. Two days before admission, she had nausea and several episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis in the evening, after she had eaten seafood. The day before admission, she had recurrent vomiting associated with eating but was able to drink large amounts of water. Earlier that day, she had normal interaction with friends and participated in sightseeing activities, including long-distance walking. Early in the evening, she was noted to be slightly confused. Later in the evening, her friend had difficulty arousing her from sleep, and she was not able to follow directions or walk. She was carried to a car by two of her traveling companions and taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 94/64 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic and did not respond to questions or commands. Her speech was incoherent, and she cried intermittently. The pupils were 8 mm in diameter and responsive to light. She moved her arms and legs nonpurposefully. The remainder of the examination was normal. On repeat measurement, the blood pressure was 73/54 mm Hg. Intravenous access was obtained, and 700 ml of normal saline was administered intravenously before the laboratory test results were received. The blood level of sodium was 104 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145), potassium 5.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), chloride 74 mmol per liter (reference range, 98 to 107), carbon dioxide 19 mmol per liter (reference range, 24 to 32), and glucose 114 mg per deciliter (6.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the anion gap was 11 mmol per liter (reference range, 3 to 15). The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 37 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 32), and alanine aminotransferase 37 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 35). The blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin and a urine drug screen were negative. The blood level of salicylate was less than 0.2 mg per deciliter (0.01 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.8 to 20.0 mg per deciliter [0.20 to 1.44 mmol per liter]), and acetaminophen 0 \u03bcg per milliliter. Intensive care was not available at the other hospital, and the patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. During the flight, the patient was agitated and unable to lie still. Ketamine was administered, along with normal saline and hypertonic saline. On evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and further history was obtained from her family. She was healthy and used an etonogestrel implant. She was a graduate student, resided in the southern United States, and was visiting New England with friends. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use over-the-counter medications. Her mother had had breast cancer, but there was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/57 mm Hg, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was somnolent and did not respond to commands, but she opened her eyes and withdrew in response to painful stimuli. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light. The mucous membranes were moist. The skin turgor was normal. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The breath sounds were normal in both lungs, without wheezing or rhonchi. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The edge of the liver was not palpable. There was no splenomegaly. The arms and legs had no edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Additional laboratory studies were performed, and the results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or intracranial mass lesions. Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema, a normal cardiac silhouette, and no pleural effusions. Laboratory Data.

One year before this presentation, a ballooning lesion had developed in the patient\u2019s left ear canal that partially occluded the lumen and was associated with pruritus and recurrent bleeding. An unknown medication was administered topically into the ear canal, with improvement in both bleeding and pruritus. Two weeks before this presentation, bleeding from the left ear canal recurred, with associated pruritus of both ear canals. The patient was seen by a physician at another clinic, who prescribed an otic suspension (consisting of neomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) and a 5-day course of oral azithromycin, as well as topical clobetasol propionate ointment (0.05%) for pruritus; the symptoms did not improve, and the bleeding did not resolve. She was referred to the outpatient otolaryngology clinic of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient reported brief episodes of sharp, stabbing otalgia on the left side, with episodes of disequilibrium that lasted for a few seconds and were not associated with vertigo, tinnitus, or changes in hearing. She had not had recurrent otitis media during childhood, exposure to loud noises, or head trauma with loss of consciousness. She took no other medications and had no known allergies. She worked in a health-related field. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. On examination, the patient appeared to be well, with no craniofacial dysmorphism. A light pink raised lesion (approximately 1.0 cm by 1.0 cm by 0.5 cm), with a cobblestone appearance and several prominent vessels, was present on the posterior tragus of the left ear; on examination with an operating microscope, the lesion extended medially along the anterior wall of the external auditory canal. The eardrums, medial left ear canal, and entire right ear canal were normal. There was no tragal tenderness. A 512-Hz tuning fork was used to show that the Rinne test was positive bilaterally (with air conduction greater than bone conduction) and that, on the Weber test, the sound was located along the midline. The remainder of the examination of the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, pharynx, larynx, neck, ears (for hearing acuity for conversational speech), and third through twelfth cranial nerves was normal, and there was no spontaneous nystagmus. A culture of the left external ear canal grew a moderate amount of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. Topical nystatin\u2013triamcinolone ointment was administered to the left ear twice daily for 2 weeks, without improvement. One week later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic.

On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and \u201cweird.\u201d A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Initial Imaging Studies.An axial image from CT angiography of the head (Panel A), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows nonspecific mild white-matter changes (arrowheads) and a nonspecific small right-peritrigonal calcification (arrow). A coronal image from CT angiography of the chest (Panel B), obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows no pulmonary edema, consolidation, or pneumothorax. An axial image from CT angiography of the abdomen (Panel C), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows a left adrenal nodule (arrow) with an attenuation level of less than 10 Hounsfield units, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. MRI of the Head.MRI of the head confirmed the findings on CT, showing no acute or subacute infarction, mass, or acute intracranial hemorrhage. A T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel A) and a susceptibility-weighted image (Panel B) show right-peritrigonal signal abnormalities (arrows) that correlate with the small calcification observed on CT, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. The T2-weighted FLAIR image (Panel A) also shows nonspecific mild white-matter changes (arrowhead). A diffusion-weighted image (Panel C) shows no abnormal restricted diffusivity. The patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal.

The patient had been well until 6 weeks earlier, when painless hematuria had developed, with passage of clots, while he was traveling in a wilderness area. After 2 days, he saw a nurse practitioner at a local facility. Attempts at passing a catheter into his bladder were unsuccessful, and he was referred to a hospital in a larger city. Computed tomography (CT) performed without the administration of contrast material reportedly revealed a multilobulated mass (isodense to hyperdense and measuring 8 cm by 7.5 cm by 6.5 cm) in the urinary bladder, diffuse fat stranding in the perivesical and left periurethral regions, and bilateral intrarenal calculi and cysts. The next day, cystoscopic examination revealed an open prostatic urethra and brisk bleeding, making visualization of the bladder difficult. A fungating lesion at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 o'clock position, with an adherent clot, was partially excised. Laser ablation resulted in hemostasis. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed focal adenocarcinoma in situ that was thought to be of bladder origin and was associated with bland papillary and glandular epithelium, with no evidence of invasion. Five days later, bleeding persisted, and the patient was transferred to a second hospital, near his home. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral renal cysts and bilateral nonobstructing nephrolithiasis. The next day, repeat cystoscopy reportedly revealed a large fungating lesion and clot at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 o'clock position. Flushing of the bladder and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly showed adenocarcinoma; consultation with outside experts was pending. CT of the abdomen, performed the next day, reportedly revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. After decompression of the bladder with a catheter, irregular thickening of the bladder wall was seen, with an irregular, multiloculated gas collection, 2.5 cm by 3.5 cm, in the suprapubic region. The patient was discharged on the fifth day to follow up with his urologist. Nineteen days before this evaluation, transrectal biopsies of the prostate were performed with ultrasonographic guidance. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed adenocarcinoma in one of two cores from the right base, with a Gleason score of 7 (grade 3 plus grade 4) on a scale of 1 to 10 (with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis), involving 30% of the tissue, and adenocarcinoma in a core from the left lateral midportion, with a Gleason score of 6 (3+3), involving 10% of the tissue. The patient was referred to the cancer center of this hospital. He reported that hematuria and clot passage had resolved and that he felt well. He had a history of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention, for which a transurethral resection of the prostate had been performed elsewhere 12 years earlier. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly had shown an area of focal high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Four subsequent prostatic biopsies, the most recent performed 4 years before this evaluation, were negative for cancer. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), measured annually, had been normal until 5 days after the second cystoscopy, 1 month before this evaluation, when the level was 13.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, \u22644.0). The patient also had erectile dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diverticulosis, mild obstructive sleep apnea (for which he used continuous positive air pressure at night), and nephrolithiasis, which was treated with lithotripsy. Results of a colonoscopy performed 1 year earlier were normal. Medications included atorvastatin and verapamil; other medications (doxazosin, amlodipine, valsartan, telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium aminobenzoic acid, oxybutynin chloride, and potassium chloride supplement) had recently been stopped. He was married, had adult children, and was retired from the shipping industry, where he had been exposed to asbestos. He was physically active in outdoor activities. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no family history of urologic cancers. On examination, the pulse was 50 beats per minute and the blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.0. Rectal examination was not performed, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood potassium level was 3.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the urea nitrogen level 15 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]); the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2of body-surface area (reference range, \u226560).

On the morning of admission, she noted increased bruising on his thighs and \u201cbroken capillaries\u201d on his cheeks and eyelids. On examination at another hospital, he was active and behaviorally appropriate. The rectal temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 146 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were multiple scattered petechiae on the face, chest, and legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory results are shown inTable 1. He was transferred to this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient was active and developmentally normal. At 3 months of age, intermittent urticaria had developed when small amounts of a milk-based formula were given, mixed with breast milk. There was no history of trauma, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, or blood in the urine or stool. He was born to a primigravida by cesarean section because of preeclampsia, after full-term gestation. Immunizations were current, excluding influenza A (H1N1) and seasonal influenza vaccines. Acetaminophen had been administered for teething pain until 2 days before this presentation. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and two dogs, did not attend day care, and had no exposures to sick persons. A cousin of his mother had splenomegaly of unknown cause; there was no known family history of hematologic disorders. The vital signs and physical examination were unchanged. The ABO blood type was A, Rh-positive, with negative screening for antibodies to red cells. Blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, direct and total bilirubin, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown inTable 1. Anti-RhD immune globulin (referred to as anti-D) (550 \u03bcg [50 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight]) was administered intravenously. Test results from the next day are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures drawn at the other hospital remained sterile, and the patient was discharged home. Subsequent outpatient evaluation revealed platelet counts of 120,000 per cubic millimeter on the second day after discharge and 32,000 per cubic millimeter on the sixth day after discharge; the hematocrit was 28.1%, the hemoglobin level 9.6 g per deciliter, and reticulocytes 16.6%. Ten days after discharge, the platelet count was 1000 per cubic millimeter. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. The pulse was 139 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the weight 11.2 kg; other vital signs were normal. There were isolated petechiae on the tongue and fine petechiae on the face and thighs. Test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous immune globulin was infused, and the patient was discharged the next day. During the next 9 days, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at a 1:40 dilution and negative at 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions (normal, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions) with a speckled pattern, and testing for antigranulocyte antibodies was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. When the patient was 8 months of age, a diagnosis of milk allergy was made based on the presence of urticaria, diarrhea, and radioallergosorbent testing, and soy-based formula was begun. Diarrhea resolved, but he vomited frequently. Two months after the first admission, when the patient was 8.5 months of age, fever to a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C developed that was unresponsive to outpatient ceftriaxone therapy. This was followed by worsening diarrhea, nonbilious emesis, and increasing lethargy over a period of several days, as well as fever to a temperature of 40\u00b0C. Blood cultures were sterile. He was readmitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 40\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 101/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 11.7 kg. Nasopharyngeal tests for influenza A and B viruses were negative, as were stool tests for enteric pathogens,Clostridium difficiletoxin, rotavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and ova and parasites. Testing for reducing substances in the stool and urine was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Results of renal ultrasonography were normal. Ibuprofen, intravenous fluids, and ceftriaxone were administered. Parenteral nutrition was administered for 3 days; fever and diarrhea resolved. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2020To convert the values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4. During the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held. The patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment. Immunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1). Clinical Photographs.The patient has well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques involving the back, abdomen, arms, and legs (Panels A and B). The evanescent rash is nonpruritic and nontender; it does not affect the palms or soles. The ferritin andd-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries. Imaging Studies.Coronal and axial CT images (Panels A and B, respectively) of the abdomen and pelvis show multiple enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes (arrows) and an enlarged iliac lymph node (arrowhead). The liver and spleen have a normal appearance. There is no evidence of cholecystitis, although a single gallstone was detected (not shown). There is no evidence of cancer. A sagittal ultrasound image (Panel C) shows joint fluid in the right knee (arrow); small effusions involving both knees and hips were detected (not shown). The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count remained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The administration of antibiotic agents was stopped.

Three years before this admission, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in a large hematoma across the chest and umbilicus. He was evaluated at another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, cervical spine, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank, and the fat of the left retroperitoneum (Figure 1); this finding was reported to be consistent with soft-tissue contusion or hemorrhage. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home. CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis Obtained 3 Years before Admission.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, show subcutaneous stranding in the ventral abdominal wall (Panels A and B, arrows). Laboratory Data. Two days later, gross hematuria developed, and the patient was evaluated at the other hospital; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. He was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of thrombocytopenia and hematuria. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (in accordance with a hematuria protocol), revealed no renal or ureteral stones, solid renal masses, or ureteral or bladder filling defects. The stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, left flank, and left retroperitoneum appeared to have been stable since the previous study had been obtained, 3 days earlier. The hematuria resolved without intervention. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis and polychromasia of the red cells, with occasional schistocytes, as well as a reduced number of platelets and normal-appearing white cells. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for IgG and IgM antibodies toEhrlichia chaffeensis,Anaplasma phagocytophilum,andBorrelia burgdorferiwere negative. The thrombocytopenia and anemia were attributed to large soft-tissue hematomas and hematuria, and the patient was discharged home. On follow-up evaluation 1 week after discharge, the platelet count was 242,000 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 150,000 to 400,000); 1 month after discharge, the hematocrit was 44% (normal range, 41 to 53). The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 weeks before the current admission to this hospital, when fatigue, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Four episodes of palpitations, chest tightness, and diaphoresis occurred during the 2-week period leading up to admission; they lasted less than 1 minute each, and the patient attributed them to panic attacks. Five days before this admission, fevers and night sweats developed, and the highest measured temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Three days before this admission, the patient noted an area of erythema in the posterior aspect of the right knee and bruising on both arms. One day before this admission, an episode of weakness and tunnel vision occurred while the patient was standing; he lowered himself to the ground but did not lose consciousness. Severe fatigue persisted after the episode, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. A screening test for antibodies toB. burgdorferiwas positive. Doxycycline, clindamycin, and quinine were administered, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a mild headache, which diminished after the administration of ibuprofen; there was no neck pain or photophobia. He had a history of alcohol-use disorder, peptic ulcer disease, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and anxiety. He had no history of easy bruising or bleeding, despite previous trauma, including a fall from a roof 3 years before admission. Recent medications included diazepam and citalopram. He drank alcohol occasionally in a binge pattern but had not had any during the past 2 weeks. He did not smoke cigarettes, use illicit drugs, or take herbal medications. He resided on an island in New England and worked as a restaurant cook. He noted ticks on his body several times per month and had removed a tick 2 weeks before this presentation. His mother had diabetes, and his father had hypertension. There was no family history of hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/57 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and did not appear ill. The first and second heart sounds were normal, and the lungs were clear. The abdomen was not distended; bowel sounds were present, with no tenderness on palpation or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no swelling in the legs. An area of blanching erythema (6 cm in diameter) was present on the right popliteal fossa (Figure 2A); a similar lesion (5 cm in diameter) was present near the left patella. Areas of petechiae were noted in the erythematous lesions and on the left flank. Clinical Photograph and Peripheral-Blood Specimen Obtained on Admission.Panel A shows a 6-cm lesion with blanching erythema on the right popliteal fossa. Panel B shows a representative field from the initial peripheral-blood smear with evidence of normocytic red cells and thrombocytopenia and with no schistocytes; what appears to be a ring-shaped inclusion in the red cells near the neutrophil is an artifact of the slide preparation. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2B) revealed mostly normocytic erythrocytes, with less than 1 schistocyte per high-power field (i.e., occasional schistocytes were seen, but not in every high-power field), increased reticulocytes, no spherocytes, minor basophilic stippling, and no inclusion bodies in erythrocytes. Platelets were decreased in number but increased in size and had normal granularity. White cells appeared normal and had a normal granulation pattern. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood and 2+ protein, with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal, and examination of the sediment revealed 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused; the hematocrit increased from 17.6% on admission to 22.5% (normal range, 41 to 53), and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Azithromycin and atovaquone were administered, and doxycycline was continued. On the third hospital day, the patient had the sudden onset of expressive aphasia, pronator drift of the right arm, and inability to follow complex commands. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed normal intracranial and neck vessels.

Three years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements. Two years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity. Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep \u2014 including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams \u2014 continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours. The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles). One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3\u2013C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1). MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed 4 months before the current evaluation. Diffusion-weighted images (Panels A and B) and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel C) show a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale (arrows). FLAIR images (Panels C and D) show nonspecific moderate-to-severe background white-matter changes. T2-weighted images (Panels E and F) show chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellar hemisphere (arrows). Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient\u2019s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated. The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation. On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably. In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient\u2019s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation. A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors. Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence. However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient\u2019s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG.

Approximately 1 year before presentation, the patient had had transient tightness in the chest and shoulder on the left side that had prompted a referral to outpatient physical therapy. Five days before presentation, while the patient was packing for a flight to Boston, acute substernal chest pain developed; the pain radiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feeling of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously resolved, and she attributed them to fatigue. On the day before presentation, substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw and shoulders recurred after the patient had been walking, and the pain gradually resolved after a few hours. Before dinner on the evening of presentation, the pain recurred and was associated with light-headedness. The patient attended dinner but had persistent pain, along with dyspnea. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital. On physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/87 mm Hg in both arms, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She did not have carotid bruits or jugular venous distention, nor did she have cardiac murmur, rub, or gallop on auscultation. Her digits were hyperextensible. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. The patient had no history of dysrhythmia, heart-failure symptoms, trauma, or constitutional, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic symptoms. She had undergone a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst, and she had had a miscarriage 1 month before this evaluation. She took no medications. Penicillin and sulfa drugs caused urticaria. She exercised four times weekly with an elliptical machine and walked her dog daily. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; she consumed two alcoholic beverages per week. She had a healthy 11-year-old daughter. Her father had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and an embolic stroke. Her mother, brother, and sister had hypermobile Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome: her mother had joint hypermobility and had received the diagnosis during her first pregnancy because of recurrent hip subluxations; her brother had joint hypermobility and spontaneous pneumothorax and bruised easily; and her sister had joint hypermobility and bruised easily. A maternal second cousin had died at 51 years of age from a cerebral aneurysm. Electrocardiography and cardiac imaging studies were performed. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm and submillimeter downsloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5(Figure 1). The depressions had decreased in magnitude on electrocardiography performed 3 hours later and had fully resolved on electrocardiography performed 8 hours after presentation. Electrocardiogram.An electrocardiogram, which was obtained on presentation, shows a normal sinus rhythm and submillimeter downsloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5. Transthoracic echocardiography showed overall normal left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function. There was a small, focal area of hypokinesis in the left ventricular inferolateral wall (seeVideo 1andVideo 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was no clinically significant valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or pericardial effusion. Although there was increased mobility of the interatrial septum, a color Doppler study showed no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography showed no abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material with the use of a standard aortic-dissection protocol. There was no evidence of aortic dissection or proximal pulmonary embolism. The aorta appeared normal, with a preserved sinotubular junction, and the ascending aorta and descending aorta each had a normal diameter.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 week before this admission, when severe fatigue and generalized weakness developed. He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however, he had also noticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite. During the next week, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness, gait instability, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia, dysphagia, and nausea. On the day of admission, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrology clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath, dark urine, and continued anorexia, nausea, odynophagia, dysphagia, and abdominal discomfort. He reported no chills, night sweats, cough, chest pain, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria. The patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Six months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell\u2013mediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued. One month before the current admission, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection. Two weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]); routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The patient also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Current medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, labetalol, nifedipine, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and belatacept. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. On the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs. The blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest (Figure 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Figure 2) revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Imaging Studies of the Chest Obtained on Admission.A frontal radiograph (Panel A) shows multiple tiny pulmonary nodules (arrows) scattered diffusely throughout both lungs in a miliary pattern. Coronal (Panel B) and axial (Panel C) images from a CT on lung windows show numerous small bilateral nodules (yellow arrows) that are new relative to imaging obtained 6 months earlier. The distribution of nodules is random, a characteristic that is suggestive of a hematogenous origin. There is a small right pleural effusion (Panel C, blue arrow). A coronal CT image obtained with soft-tissue windows (Panel D) shows enlarged bilateral hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes that are partially calcified (arrows). These findings are consistent with the known history of chronic sarcoidosis. CT of the Abdomen and Spleen.Shown are coronal images of the abdomen obtained with soft-tissue windows from CT performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material 6 months before admission (i.e., baseline) (Panel A) and on admission (Panel B). There has been development of splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 16 cm on admission. A small volume of new perihepatic ascites is also present (arrow). While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Within 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 \u03bcmol per liter), the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter), and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter).

The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when he began to have decreased energy and poor appetite, symptoms that were associated with a weight loss of 4.5 kg. The next week, he was evaluated by his primary care physician. The patient reported dyspnea on exertion, diffuse myalgias, and severe fatigue that prevented him from engaging in his usual activities of walking outside, gardening, and swimming in the ocean. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 124/73 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Tests for hepatitis C antibodies, antitreponemal antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A stool test was positive for occult blood, and a diagnostic colonoscopy was scheduled. Laboratory Data. Three days before admission, the patient felt feverish but did not check his temperature at home. Fevers continued, despite the use of acetaminophen. One day before admission, he had one episode of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. On the day of admission, the patient had an unwitnessed fall while he was standing in the bathroom; he reported that he had felt generally weak and had tried to sit down but fell backward and struck his head, without loss of consciousness. He was found on the floor by a family member and was unable to stand up. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported generalized myalgias but no headache, photophobia, or neck stiffness. He had a history of hypertension, non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Medications included lisinopril and aspirin; the diabetes was controlled by diet. He had no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. He had not smoked tobacco in 30 years but had previously smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. He was retired, resided in New England, and had not traveled outside the region in several years. He did not have pets or known exposures to bats. He had recently cleaned out the basement of his home, where he had occasionally seen mice. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 140/64 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was diaphoretic but did not appear ill. He was alert and oriented, and he answered questions appropriately. Examination of cranial nerves II through XII was normal. Strength and sensation to light touch were intact in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal; the plantar reflex was flexor bilaterally. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was no rash. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. A urinalysis was unremarkable; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Imaging studies of the head did not show evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. The lungs were normal, with no pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy. Mild circumferential thickening of the middle and distal esophagus was noted. No focal hepatic lesions, thickening or distention of the gastrointestinal tract, or suspicious lytic or blastic lesions of the bones were noted. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 12 hours, altered mental status developed, with progressive confusion, difficulties with word finding, and inability to consistently follow commands. Several attempts at lumbar puncture for analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were unsuccessful, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. Additional studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed scattered foci of signal abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter, with no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. Electroencephalography revealed intermittent irregular delta slowing that was most prominent in the left frontocentral area and intermittent diffuse theta slowing in the background, with no epileptiform abnormalities. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 19.5 cm of water; other results are shown inTable 1. Doxycycline was administered orally. Fevers continued, despite the administration of acetaminophen. The blood cultures had no growth. Progressive tachypnea developed, and the patient was unable to lie in a recumbent position to undergo repeat MRI of the head. Elective intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. On the fourth hospital day, repeat MRI of the head was performed. FLAIR images showed new mild, diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci, and FLAIR and T2-weighted images showed mild hyperintensity in the medial thalami and medial temporal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed on the fourth hospital day. There is mild hyperintensity in the medial temporal lobes (Panel A, arrows) and the thalami (Panels B and C, arrowheads), as well as mildly increased signal in the sulci, most notably in the sylvian fissures (Panel B, arrows). There are scattered hyperintense foci in the white matter, most prominently in the left corona radiata (Panel D, arrow). Physical examination, which was performed while the patient was not receiving sedation, revealed decreased tone and no spontaneous movements of the arms or legs, findings consistent with flaccid paralysis. There was also no withdrawal in response to nail-bed pressure, and deep-tendon reflexes were absent in the arms, knees, and ankles bilaterally. The patient opened his eyes but did not regard or track the examiner and did not respond to requests. The diameter of the pupils was 3 mm bilaterally and decreased to 2 mm in response to bright light. The corneal reflexes and cough reflex were intact, but there was no grimace in response to pressure in the supraorbital notch. On the 10th hospital day, nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory responses of the left median and ulnar nerves were prolonged and had moderately-to-severely reduced amplitude, and the motor responses of the bilateral median nerves had severely reduced amplitude, normal conduction velocities, and normal durations. Stimulation of the muscles by means of needle electromyography revealed abundant fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in the left deltoid, extensor digitorum communis, first dorsal interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles, as well as increased insertional activity in the left vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius muscles and no voluntary motor units in the left arm or leg.

271, "prompt": "A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss. Two months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient\u2019s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement. Five days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital. In the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist. One month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist. On the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration. On examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye. Funduscopic Images.A funduscopic examination was performed 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photograph of the right eye (Panel A), the optic disk shows pallor as compared with the optic disk of the left eye (Panel B), as well as blurred margins due to swelling (asterisks) and subtle evidence of abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect (arrow). A follow-up funduscopic examination was performed 16 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photograph of the right eye (Panel C), the optic disk shows increased pallor, decreased swelling, and greater prominence of the abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect, a finding consistent with optociliary shunt vessels. The blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later. Six days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4. MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion. MRI of the Head.On admission to this hospital, approximately 9 weeks after the onset of symptoms, MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences (Panels A and B, respectively) show prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with abnormal increased homogeneous enhancement (arrows). A coronal T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence (Panel C) shows diffuse hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without adjacent orbital edema. Approximately 2 months later, follow-up MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences (Panels D and E, respectively) show similar segmental enlargement and abnormal enhancement of the intraorbital right optic nerve (arrows). A coronal T2-weighted STIR sequence (Panel F) shows similar hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without inflammatory changes in the orbital fat. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone. During the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.

Six years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neurologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypodensity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). MRI and CT Angiogram.Six years before the current evaluation, MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A diffusion-weighted image (Panel A) shows subtle foci of hyperintensity in the left medial cerebellum (arrow) and left lateral medulla (arrowhead). On an apparent diffusion coefficient map (Panel B), the corresponding lesions are isointense to hyperintense. On a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel C), the lesions are hyperintense (arrow and arrowhead). These findings are consistent with evolving nonacute infarcts. On the current evaluation, CT angiography of the neck was performed after the administration of contrast material. An axial image (Panel D) shows asymmetric irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the C2\u2013C3 level (arrow), a finding consistent with dissection. A maximum-intensity-projection reformation (Panel E) shows a medially directed 2-mm pseudoaneurysm (arrow) along the dissected left vertebral artery (LVA). In addition, MRI was performed before the administration of contrast material. A T1-weighted image obtained at the C2\u2013C3 level (Panel F) shows a curvilinear mural hematoma with intrinsic hyperintensity (arrow) along the dissection site. The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclovir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic. One month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow. Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test. The patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position. The patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia in both of his parents, as well as early-onset dementia in his father. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests. Urinalysis was also normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 (upper cervical) segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2\u2013C3 level (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection (Figure 1F). The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis.CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of contrast material. An axial image (Panel A) shows a curvilinear filling defect within the right renal artery (arrow), a finding consistent with dissection. A coronal image (Panel B) shows a region of hypoenhancement in the right kidney (arrow), a finding suggestive of infarction.

The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, \u226411), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure. Electrocardiograms.An electrocardiogram obtained 25 years before the current evaluation (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that meets the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Electrocardiographic tracings obtained during the next 15 years showed similar findings. An electrocardiogram obtained 9 years before the current evaluation (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm with complete heart block and escape rhythm with right bundle-branch block and left-axis deviation. During the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema. A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril. Nine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun. During the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Four years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness. At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal. The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication. The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco. On examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis.

Two days before this admission, increasing weakness, lethargy, chills, and diarrhea developed. The patient became less responsive to his family and increasingly irritable and confused. He stopped taking his medications. On the day of admission, his oral intake was 500 ml of liquid. His family reported that he was in an \u201calmost catatonic\u201d state; he was unable to arise from bed, had recurrent epistaxis, and reported pain in his chest and left arm. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been in poor health, with a recent diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin. He had a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac evaluations that had been performed over the previous decade had revealed an exudative pericardial effusion that had spontaneously resolved, as well as heart failure predominantly on the right side (left ventricular ejection fraction, 69%; pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, 61 mm Hg). A biopsy of the right side of the heart did not reveal a cause of the heart failure. The patient had had recurrent epistaxis since childhood, and it had recently worsened. Additional medical history included hyperlipidemia, pancytopenia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and headaches; there was also a possible history of an arteriovenous malformation of the brain, which had been noted on an imaging study obtained 20 years earlier but had not been confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at this hospital 7 years before this admission. He had undergone excision of a basal-cell carcinoma and an appendectomy. One month before this admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of acute confusion and worsening edema. During that admission, ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant was performed. An image of the right lower lobe of the liver showed a communication between the right portal vein and the right hepatic vein, a finding consistent with a hepatic venovenous malformation with portosystemic shunting (Figure 1). Ultrasound Images of the Right Upper Quadrant.An image of the right lower lobe of the liver (Panel A) shows a communication between the right portal vein (arrow) and the right hepatic vein (arrowhead). Doppler ultrasound images show the portal vein (Panel B, arrow) and the hepatic vein (Panel C, arrow). A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was made. The confusion improved after the initiation of treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. On the current admission, medications included warfarin, metoprolol, simvastatin, furosemide, spironolactone, potassium chloride, lactulose, rifaximin, ferrous sulfate, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, and, owing to enrollment in a clinical trial investigating therapies for pulmonary hypertension, either sildenafil or placebo. The patient had had adverse reactions to azithromycin, lansoprazole, and metolazone. He lived with his wife and was retired from a position in higher education. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His parents had died when they were in their 70s; his father had had heart disease, and his mother had had a stroke. His mother and his daughter had a history of recurrent epistaxis and of easy bleeding. On examination, the patient was somnolent but easily roused by vocal stimulation. He was oriented and cooperative, with waxing and waning attention, and he was uncertain about why he was in the hospital. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/61 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and dried blood was noted around the nares. There were multiple telangiectasias on the face, lips, and torso, and there were nonblanching cherry angiomas on the chest. The heart sounds were irregularly irregular; the first and second sounds were otherwise normal. The lungs were clear bilaterally. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds were present. There was no abdominal distention, and the edge of the liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. Testing for Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. No rectal masses were detected on palpation; the stool was brown, with trace blood. There was no asterixis. The legs were dark and discolored, a finding consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, as were levels of vitamin B12and folate, which had been obtained 1 week earlier; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow fluid, with a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 5.5, and trace blood; the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 0 to 2 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, frequent premature ventricular contractions, ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm in leads II, III, and aVF, and downsloping ST-segment depression of 2 mm in lead V6. Laboratory Data. A radiograph of the chest showed evidence of persistent interstitial edema and focal opacities in both lower lobes; these findings could represent alveolar edema, superimposed pneumonia, or aspiration. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed with the administration of oral contrast material, revealed nonspecific pneumatosis of the ascending colon to the level of the hepatic flexure, without associated portal venous gas or other inflammatory changes. Cholelithiasis, atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and mesenteric vessels, and cardiomegaly were also present (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Abdomen.An axial image shows pneumatosis of the hepatic flexure (arrow) and atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta (arrowhead). Intravenous normal saline, vancomycin, cefepime, and oral potassium chloride were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. On his arrival in the inpatient unit, the dose of rifaximin was increased, warfarin and furosemide were discontinued, and lactulose and other outpatient medications were resumed.

The patient had been well until approximately 7 months before admission, when low-grade fevers and fatigue occurred; the fevers were associated with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg. Five months before admission, pain in his right arm and leg developed. Imaging performed at another hospital revealed deep venous thromboses, and analysis of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a white-cell count of 33,000 per cubic millimeter, with 53% blasts. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen reportedly revealed 74% lymphoid blasts. A diagnosis of B-cell ALL was made, and cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL translocation). Induction chemotherapy with a standard multidrug regimen, including cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, and dasatinib, was administered. Six weeks after the diagnosis was made, follow-up examination of another bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed morphologically complete remission. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital for a consultation about allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. He underwent consolidation chemotherapy while an HLA-matched unrelated donor was identified through the National Marrow Donor Program. Plans were then made to proceed with HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. Five months after the diagnosis of ALL and 3 days before the patient's admission for the transplantation, pathological examination of another bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed continued complete remission. One day before admission, a triple-lumen tunneled catheter was placed. The next day, he was admitted to this hospital. The fevers and fatigue that had occurred before the diagnosis of ALL had resolved. The patient had a history of low-back pain and intravenous opiate use. Maintenance chemotherapy, including 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib, was stopped 2 weeks before admission; medications on admission included enoxaparin and oxycodone. Palifermin was administered 3 days before admission, for prevention of mucositis. The patient had no known allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for more than 25 years (and continued to do so), drank alcohol rarely, and stopped opiate use after receiving the diagnosis of cancer. He lived alone in New England, had one child, and was disabled because of this illness. He was of Native American ancestry. His mother and maternal grandmother had died; both had had lung cancer. The patient's maternal aunt had breast cancer, and his father had multiple sclerosis. On examination, the vital signs were normal and the weight was 98 kg. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 1 indicating that the patient is ambulatory but restricted in terms of physically strenuous activity, and 5 indicating death); the score on the Karnofsky performance scale was 90 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 90 indicating that the patient is able to perform normal activities with minor signs or symptoms of disease, and 0 indicating death). The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organomegaly. The skin of the right arm had numerous scars and chronic superficial thromboses, features that were consistent with previous intravenous drug use. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown inTable 1. The administration of allopurinol, famciclovir, ursodiol, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was begun, and narcotic analgesic agents were continued. During the first week, the patient underwent total-body irradiation and the administration of high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. He also agreed to participate in a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), administered 3 days before stem-cell transplantation, for the prevention of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295710). The administration of fluconazole and ciprofloxacin as infectious disease prophylaxis was begun on the day before transplantation, as was tacrolimus for the prevention of GVHD; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. Laboratory Data. On hospital day 9, HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem cells were infused. As expected, pancytopenia occurred and persisted for many days thereafter; test results are shown inTable 1. Severe mucositis and diarrhea developed, and total parenteral nutrition was initiated for nutritional support. On hospital day 13 (day 4 after transplantation) and intermittently thereafter as needed, packed red cells and platelets were transfused. On hospital day 15 (day 6 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 38.4\u00b0C. Fluconazole was continued, ciprofloxacin and famciclovir were stopped, and intravenous cefepime, vancomycin, and acyclovir were begun; the fever resolved within 32 hours. Loperamide was administered for diarrhea. Episodes of epistaxis and melena occurred on hospital day 18 (day 9 after transplantation) and intermittently thereafter; aminocaproic acid was administered for the prevention of bleeding due to refractory thrombocytopenia, despite multiple platelet transfusions. On hospital day 21 (day 12 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 38.4\u00b0C, and fevers with associated episodes of confusion and hallucinations persisted daily thereafter. Fluconazole was stopped, and micafungin was started. The weight was 106 kg, and there was swelling of the face, erythema and ulceration of the throat and mouth, and edema of the arms and legs. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions. Test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were sterile. Furosemide was administered, without improvement. Four days later, abdominal distention and pain that was localized to the right lower quadrant occurred and was associated with guarding and rebound. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in the upper lungs, opacity in the right lower lobe (suggestive of atelectasis), apparent esophageal-wall thickening, mild pulmonary edema, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed changes consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis and inflammation of the cecum, as well as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal edema, free fluid, and innumerable subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Figure 1). Image of the Abdomen.A sagittal reconstruction of a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material on day 16 after stem-cell transplantation, shows cecal-wall thickening, a thickened retrocecal appendix, and periappendiceal inflammatory changes (arrow). A small amount of free fluid is present. Surgical consultants evaluated the patient and determined that he had a very high operative risk, and conservative therapy was recommended. All oral intake was stopped. Metronidazole was administered; however, pain and signs of peritonitis worsened and fevers persisted. Blood cultures remained sterile, and testing of the stool forClostridium difficiletoxin was negative. The next day, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). On examination in the ICU, the temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air, and the weight 108 kg. He appeared uncomfortable and inattentive. The oral mucosa was erythematous, and there were ulcerations of the lips, oral cavity, and throat. The jugular vein was distended above the right atrium, and the jugular venous pressure was 10 to 12 cm of water. Breath sounds were decreased at the right lung base. Bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was distended and slightly firm to palpation, with tenderness to percussion throughout, rebound and guarding in the right lower quadrant, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. There was 3+ pitting edema to the sacrum. The rest of the examination was normal. The plasma lactic acid concentration was normal. Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema. Supplemental oxygen and additional furosemide were administered; infusion of total parenteral nutrition was stopped. On hospital day 27 (day 18 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 40.6\u00b0C. The blood pressure was 139/94 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A repeat CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no substantial change.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as \u201cpins and needles.\u201d Over the course of several days, the paresthesia extended to the feet. Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain. Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1(thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12(cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1) was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material. MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed 5 days before the current presentation. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Panels B and C) show mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter (Panel C, arrow), with a dominant lesion in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata (Panels A and B, arrows). There was no associated abnormal enhancement. The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath. Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer. The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed.

hospital because of abdominal pain and an ovarian mass. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were performed.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a complex, thick-walled cyst in the right ovary. There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized. Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later. After the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants. The patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were performed. Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness. Imaging Studies.MRI of the pelvis was performed. A coronal T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows a large, heterogeneous, round lesion (arrows). The lesion has internal solid, mixed hypointense and hyperintense signal intensity and multiple internal cystic foci. A sagittal T2-weighted image (Panel B) shows endometrial hypertrophy (22 mm in thickness). The lesion is only partially visible anterosuperior to the uterus and the large-volume ascites (Panels A and B, asterisks). CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reconstruction images (Panels C and D, respectively) show the full extent of the large heterogeneous lesion (arrows). The lesion has areas of nodular, solid enhancement. Large-volume ascites in the abdomen and pelvis is also noted (Panels C and D, asterisks), along with endometrial hypertrophy (Panel D, arrowhead). There is no evidence of peritoneal thickening or deposits. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had been well until 5 days before this evaluation, when arthralgias in her fingers, hands, and shoulders developed, along with back pain, neck pain, and a retro-orbital headache. Later that day, fever occurred (temperature, 39.0\u00b0C) and was accompanied by chills, nausea, decreased appetite, sore throat, and mild redness of her eyes. She also noted a vaginal ulcer, ulcers on the side of her tongue, decreased taste sensation, and enlarged, tender lymph nodes in her neck and groin. The next morning, the patient awoke with a rash on her right forearm. The lesions were pink, pruritic, and nonpainful; some were flat and others were raised, resembling hives. Within 1 hour, the rash spread to her torso and both arms and legs. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed on the basis of her clinical presentation; she was discharged home. The following day, the patient\u2019s arthralgias persisted and involved not only her fingers, hands, and shoulders but also her elbows, knees, ankles, and toes. Swelling in her wrists and hands led her to remove a bracelet and her wedding ring. Her gums bled easily when she brushed her teeth. By that evening, her fever, headache, and rash had remitted. Over the next 2 days, the arthralgias persisted but all other symptoms continued to abate. On the fifth day of illness, a new pruritic, erythematous rash developed, beginning on her palms and spreading to her arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs, sparing the soles of her feet. The patient took ibuprofen and diphenhydramine and then presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had a remote history of appendectomy. Her only medication was a daily multivitamin, and she had no known allergies. Immunizations were reportedly current. She lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England, worked as a chemical engineer, and enjoyed running. Three days before the onset of illness, the patient had returned from a 7-day trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands, where she spent time on the beach and received multiple mosquito bites. She was monogamous with her husband, consumed alcohol in moderation, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and had no exposure to sick persons. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. There was subtle swelling of soft tissue in the hands but no joint effusions; movement of the wrists and finger joints caused mild discomfort. There was a diffuse, erythematous, blanching, macular rash involving the abdomen, chest, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1). There were confluent macules on the palms, but the soles of the feet were spared. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The application of a tourniquet to an arm for 2.5 minutes did not precipitate the development of petechiae. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.011, a pH of 5.0, and negative results for occult blood, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, albumin, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen.

The patient had observed routine quarterly surveillance imaging after resection of right axillary melanoma, radiation therapy, and initiation of pembrolizumab therapy 3 years earlier. The most recent imaging was performed 6 days before this evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground-glass halos (Figure 1A through 1D). These findings were new relative to the most recent imaging performed 3 months earlier. Other pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right upper lobe that had been noted on imaging studies obtained during the previous 3 years were stable. Changes in the right upper lobe that had resulted from radiation therapy were also stable relative to previous imaging studies. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe that measured 9 mm in greatest dimension and a cyst in the left hepatic lobe that measured 15 mm in diameter; both were unchanged from previous imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Imaging Studies of the Chest.Six days before evaluation at this hospital, CT of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the scan shows new bilateral hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Panel A), a new peripheral patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe (Panel B), and new bilateral pulmonary nodules (Panels C and D, arrows). Positron-emission tomography and CT had been performed 3 years before the current evaluation; the scan shows a 3.5-cm right axillary soft-tissue nodal mass (Panel E, arrow) with foci of intense18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (Panel F) and no other sites of avidity. The patient was referred by her oncologist for urgent evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no symptoms, specifically no fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, new or changed skin lesions (except a mild traumatic abrasion on the right arm), pruritus, or new masses. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for superficial spreading melanoma on the right upper back that had initially been diagnosed two decades before this evaluation and had been surgically excised, with clear pathological margins. Eleven years later, an in situ superficial spreading melanoma developed on the left upper back and was completely excised. Three years before the current evaluation, locally advanced melanoma in the right axilla was diagnosed on the basis of a positron-emission tomographic and CT image that showed a 3.5-cm right axillary nodal conglomerate mass with multiple foci of intense18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake; no other sites of FDG avidity were seen (Figure 1E and 1F). Multiple pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right lobe and hypodense hepatic lesions, measuring 9 mm in the right lobe and 10 mm in the left lobe, were noted. MRI of the abdomen suggested that the hepatic lesion in the right lobe corresponded to a hemangioma and the hepatic lesion in the left lobe a cyst. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. At that time, dissection of the right axillary lymph nodes was performed, and examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 25 of 39 lymph nodes, with a high degree of extracapsular extension. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation. The patient received radiation therapy to the right axilla and supraclavicular fossa (total dose of 4800 cGy over a period of 5 weeks), followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for the next 12 months. During this course of treatment, lichenoid nodules developed on the fingers of both hands, tenosynovitis developed in the right ankle, and hypothyroidism was diagnosed, for which treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. These findings were attributed to adverse effects of the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The plan for surveillance imaging included CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which was to be performed every 3 months, and MRI of the head, which was to be performed annually. The patient\u2019s medical history also included bilateral ovarian cysts, osteopenia, and a melanocytoma of the left optic disc that had been stable for at least 13 years. A Papanicolaou smear and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus performed 3 years before this evaluation had been negative. Routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this evaluation had revealed dense breast tissue with bilateral calcifications that appeared to be benign; no suspicious lesions were noted. Medications included calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born on the northern coast of South America and had immigrated to the United States as a child. She lived in New England with her husband, two children, and two cats. She worked in the health care industry. She drank one or two glasses of wine per day and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. One month before this evaluation, she and her family had traveled to the northern coast of South America for 1 week. On the trip, the patient spent most her time outdoors, including taking trips to the jungle and swimming in fresh water, and ate local cuisine, such as water chestnuts. When she returned home with her family, her husband and one of her children had generalized myalgias and malaise that resolved spontaneously. The patient\u2019s mother had breast cancer, melanoma, and basal-cell carcinoma; her father had prostate cancer; and her daughter had mixed connective-tissue disease. Her maternal grandfather had colon cancer, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer, and her maternal cousin had melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 123/68 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. She appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. Examination showed fair skin, multiple nevi without suspicious features, and healed scars at the sites of previous surgical procedures. There were lichenoid nodules on the fingers of both hands. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests. The complete blood count and differential count were also normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture.

The patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed. During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm. Initial Imaging Studies.CT of the chest and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A coronal image of the chest (Panel A) shows mediastinal lymphadenopathy (arrow). An axial image of the abdomen (Panel B) shows retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (arrow). MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed image of the orbits (Panel C) shows enhancement of the irises, with greater enhancement in the right globe (arrow) than in the left globe, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3. The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Fundus Photographs.Fundus photographs of the right eye and the left eye (Panels A and B, respectively) show perivascular exudates (arrows) and hemorrhages (arrowheads). During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis. The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forM. tuberculosishad been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when a headache involving the left temple developed. A similar headache had occurred during an episode of shingles 15 years earlier. He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed, and the headache resolved. Four weeks before the current evaluation, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight, and the patient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo, otorrhea, rhinitis, or sore throat. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination, including a cranial nerve examination, was normal. An audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz (Figure 1A). Word recognition was 96% with the right ear and 84% with the left ear (reference range, 80 to 100). Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears. The patient received a prescription for a 12-day tapering course of oral prednisone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormal findings. Audiograms.An audiogram obtained 4 weeks before evaluation in the rheumatology clinic (Panel A) shows sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. The results are asymmetric, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear; the word recognition score (WRS) is 84% in the left ear. An audiogram obtained 3 days before evaluation in the rheumatology clinic (Panel B), after a course of prednisone therapy, shows worsening of hearing loss in both ears and reduction of the WRS to 64% in the left ear. The pure tone average (PTA) is the average of the hearing levels at three frequencies (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) of tonal sounds (reference range, 0 to 25 dB HL). The speech reception threshold (SRT) is the softest hearing level at which the patient can repeat back spondaic words (reference range, 0 to 25 dB HL). The WRS indicates the patient\u2019s ability to repeat back words (reference range [good to excellent], 80 to 100%); the scores were obtained with words presented at a level of 72 dB HL in the right ear and 75 db HL in the left ear. The air-conduction threshold is indicated by a circle for the right ear and an X for the left ear. Bone-conduction thresholds are indicated by brackets and arrowheads, which open to the right for the right ear and open to the left for the left ear. HL denotes hearing level. Four weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affiliated with this hospital. Hearing loss had progressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze tracking was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive, with the patient rotated to the left, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90% with the right ear and 64% with the left ear (Figure 1B). Results of tympanometry were normal. The patient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation. Three days later, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing hearing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermittent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vaccine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone, vitamin B12, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patient\u2019s eyes were open, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examination, including skin, joint, and neurologic assessments, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), and the C-reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The patient was referred for an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital, which was to take place on the same day. On ophthalmologic evaluation, the patient reported no blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, itching, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses, which he changed daily. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. There was evidence of anterior uveitis, with 7 cells per high-power field in the right anterior chamber and 6 to 7 cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber.

Approximately 1.5 years before the current evaluation, while the patient was in the Dominican Republic, she sought medical attention for episodic pain of the right flank, with no other symptoms. At that time, she was told she had microscopic hematuria that may be due to kidney stones, and she received a prescription for unknown oral medications. After she took the medications, the flank pain resolved, and she had no further follow-up. Two weeks before the current evaluation, bilateral back and flank pain developed. She was evaluated at a local health center. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a partially exophytic mass (2.8 cm by 2.6 cm by 2.5 cm) in the lower pole of the right kidney, with mixed echogenicity and internal vascularity. No hydronephrosis or renal stones were visualized, and the sizes of the kidneys were normal. The patient was referred for a consultation with a nephrologist at this hospital. On evaluation in the nephrology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported mild headache, nausea, and constipation; there was no abdominal or pelvic pain, hematuria, foamy urine, weight loss, anorexia, peripheral or facial edema, or rash. She had a history of stage 4 chronic kidney disease (with a baseline creatinine level of 1.8 mg per deciliter [159.1 \u03bcmol per liter]), diabetes mellitus type 2, systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, tinnitus, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and had undergone an appendectomy and a hysterectomy. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, atenolol, chlorthalidone, sitagliptin, and iron sulfate. The patient was from the Dominican Republic and had immigrated to the United States 1 year earlier. She had four children and was retired. She smoked two to five cigarettes daily and had done so for the past 30 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She had no family history of kidney stones, renal disease, or cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed incisions in the right lower quadrant and along the midline of the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable masses. No flank or costovertebral-angle tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or peripheral edema was present. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count and iron studies (including levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin) were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and albumin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.008, a pH of 7.0, 1+ occult blood, 3+ albumin, 5 to 10 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and no glucose, bilirubin, ketones, or nitrite. Laboratory Data. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive (at a dilution of 1:160). Tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B core IgM antibodies, and Bence Jones protein were negative. Levels of C3, C4, and immunoglobulins were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. Lisinopril was prescribed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys was performed without the intravenous administration of gadolinium because of impaired renal function. The images showed a complex, solid mass (measuring 3.0 cm by 2.9 cm by 2.9 cm) in the lower pole of the right kidney. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (Figure 1A and 1B), the lesion had heterogeneous signal intensity. On T1-weighted gradient-echo in-phase and out-of-phase images (Figure 1C and 1D), there was loss of signal at the posterior aspect of the lesion, a finding consistent with the presence of intravoxel fat.

The patient had a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, acne, depression, and drug dependency. She had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when insomnia developed, which she attributed to her loss of a prescription for zolpidem. During the 10 days before this presentation, she reported seeing white \u201cgranular balls,\u201d which she thought were mites or larvae, emerging from and crawling on her skin, sheets, and clothing and in her feces, apartment, and car, as well as having an associated pruritic rash. She was seen by her physician, who referred her to a dermatologist for consideration of other possible causes of the persistent rash, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, which is associated with HCV infection. Three days before this presentation, the patient ran out of clonazepam (after an undefined period during which she reportedly took more than the prescribed dose) and had increasing anxiety and insomnia. The same day, she reported seeing \u201cbugs\u201d on her 15-month-old son that were emerging from his scalp and were present on his skin and in his diaper and sputum. The patient scratched her skin and her child\u2019s skin to remove the offending agents. The day before this presentation, she called emergency medical services and she and her child were transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital. A diagnosis of possible cheyletiellosis was made. She was advised to use selenium sulfide shampoo and to follow up with her physician; the patient returned home with her child. On the morning of admission, while bathing her child, she noted that his scalp was turning red and he was crying. She came with her son to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported the presence of bugs on her skin, which she attempted to point out to examiners. She acknowledged a habit of picking at her skin since adolescence, which she said had a calming effect. Fourteen months earlier, shortly after the birth of her son, worsening acne developed that did not respond to treatment with topical antimicrobial agents and tretinoin. Four months later, a facial abscess due to methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) was successfully treated with oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The patient\u2019s son had had a MRSA-related skin infection, and after antibiotic treatment,Clostridium difficilecolitis developed, which required hospitalization. The patient reported a history of major depression (now in remission) but reported having no symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, during the periods of depression. She was dependent on sedative\u2013hypnotic medications and opiates and occasionally used illicit amphetamine salts; she reported having taken 60 mg of amphetamine salts in recent days. A diagnosis of HCV infection had been made 2 years earlier. She had had diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis, and 4 years earlier, she had a perforated duodenal ulcer that required surgical repair. Medications included buprenorphine and naloxone in combination (8 mg sublingually twice daily, although 20 mg daily was prescribed), sertraline (150 mg daily, until it ran out 2 days earlier), clonazepam (0.5 mg three times daily, until it ran out 3 days earlier), and omeprazole. She had no known allergies. She did not drink alcohol. She had injected oxycodone in the past but reported no opioid use since the birth of her child. She lived with her son, had been unemployed for 2 years, and received transitional food assistance (i.e., food stamps). Her maternal aunt had schizophrenia, and her mother had attempted suicide during the patient\u2019s childhood. On examination, the patient was cooperative, anxious, and disheveled and indicated affected areas of skin to caregivers. The blood pressure was 141/95 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. She was fully oriented. There were excoriations on her face, arms, and legs, but the midback was spared. The remainder of the general examination was normal. On mental-status examination, the patient was irritable and somewhat hostile toward a female interviewer but pleasant and cooperative with a male interviewer. She was convinced that she had a parasitic infestation and thought she might have Morgellons (a condition in which patients describe inorganic material such as fibers emerging from the skin in combination with cutaneous sensations), which she had read about on the Internet. She pleaded with examiners for their help and belief in her concerns. Her thought process was perseverative and occasionally tangential. She intermittently scratched herself. She reported no neurovegetative symptoms of depression other than insomnia. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.9 mg per deciliter (0.61 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.84 to 1.45 mmol per liter]), and the blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 43 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32). The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, and albumin, as well as the results of other tests of liver function. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 3+ occult blood by dipstick, mucin, and 5 to 10 red cells, 0 to 2 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field.

double-unit cord-blood transplantation was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea, hypoxemia, and the presence of infiltrates in both lungs. Thirty months before this admission, the patient presented to another hospital with upper respiratory symptoms, throat swelling, and anemia. On the basis of the results of a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine was administered, followed by consolidation chemotherapy with three cycles of high-dose cytarabine. Subsequently, the patient was in complete remission. One year later, a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia occurred, and mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine were administered. Two months later, fever, fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, and dry cough developed, and the patient presented to a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed multifocal nodular opacities, and the patient was treated with vancomycin. She was transferred to the first hospital, where a CT-guided lung biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed hyphae with septations, a finding that was consistent with invasive aspergillus infection. Micafungin was administered, followed by voriconazole, for a total of 12 months thereafter. Six weeks after the lung biopsy was performed (approximately 14 months before this admission), the patient was admitted to this hospital for bone marrow transplantation. After she received a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and melphalan, a double-unit cord-blood transplantation was performed. The hospital course after transplantation was complicated byStaphylococcus aureusbacteremia, respiratory failure that led to mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury that led to temporary hemodialysis, and duodenal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that was treated with glucocorticoids, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Results of a bone marrow biopsy that was performed 100 days after the transplantation were consistent with complete remission, with no evidence of recurrent leukemia. Four months before this admission, sore throat, odynophagia, and cough occurred and were thought to be caused by recurrent tonsillitis. Three courses of antimicrobial therapy (including cefuroxime and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid) were administered, and 3 months later, a tonsillectomy was performed at an affiliated hospital. Seven days before this admission, after a 2-day summer camping trip in New England, fatigue, progressive dyspnea, and diffuse myalgias occurred, followed by chills, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, rigors, and fever (to a temperature of 38.7\u00b0C). On examination in the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient had hypoxemia, with an oxygen saturation of 85% while she was breathing ambient air. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed new bilateral ground-glass opacities and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Levofloxacin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered intravenously. Approximately 20 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital. During the previous week, the patient had had loose, nonbloody stools and abdominal pain, with no other abdominal symptoms, cough, sputum production, headache, rash, or arthralgias. She had hypothyroidism, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and depression; in the past, she had had a catheter-associated thrombus of the right subclavian vein and had undergone a cesarean section. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, montelukast, amlodipine, aripiprazole, sertraline, levothyroxine, and zolpidem, as well as an albuterol inhaler as needed. She was allergic to house dust mites. She reported that she had had no tick bites or animal exposures during the recent camping trip and had had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in a hair salon and lived with her son. She drank alcohol socially, had smoked cigarettes for 3 years in the past, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had had melanoma, and her paternal grandfather had had rheumatoid arthritis. There was no other family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 90% while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, 92% while she was using a nonrebreather face mask, and 94% while she was breathing high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. She had scattered fine crackles, wheezes, and high-pitched inspiratory \u201csqueaks\u201d and \u201cpops\u201d in both lungs diffusely. There was very mild tenderness in the mid-epigastrium. The remainder of the examination was normal. On admission, vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, furosemide, and methylprednisone were administered intravenously, and ipratropium\u2013albuterol was administered by inhalation. The prothrombin time and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Cultures of the sputum, urine, and blood were performed. Testing for legionella andPneumocystis jiroveciiin the sputum and legionella antigen in the urine was negative, as was nucleic-acid testing for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On admission, chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a faint patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and trace bilateral pleural effusions. Chest CT (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, opacities in small airways of the lower lobes that were consistent with mucous plugging, bronchial-wall thickening, and bilateral pulmonary nodules that had progressed since the previous CT study had been obtained (at the second hospital 2 days earlier). A small nodule in the right upper lobe represented a scar from the previous aspergillus infection. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and trace bilateral pleural effusions were also noted. Imaging Studies of the Chest.An anteroposterior chest radiograph shows a faint patchy opacity in the left upper lobe (Panel A). A chest CT scan shows bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities that are most prominent in the upper lobes (Panel B), opacities in small airways of the lower lobes that are consistent with mucous plugging (Panel C, oval), bronchial-wall thickening (Panel C, arrow), bilateral pulmonary nodules that have progressed since the previous study was obtained (2 days earlier), and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Panel D, arrows). Eight hours after admission, the patient had a dry cough, progressive dyspnea, increased crackles on lung auscultation, and worsened hypoxemia, with an intermittent decline in the oxygen saturation to 75% despite the delivery of high-flow oxygen. Ceftazidime was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Twenty-two hours after admission, an endotracheal tube was placed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Bronchoscopic examination revealed thin, foamy secretions in the left and right bronchi, with mild, diffuse airway erythema.

The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when fatigue, subjective fever, and chills developed. The next day, he began having headaches, nonbilious nonbloody emesis, diarrhea, decreased appetite, low back pain, and dysuria. On the day before admission, he was able to drink only one glass of water without vomiting. His mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported dry mouth, eye pain when he was febrile, and light-headedness. He had a history of exercise-induced asthma and had been hospitalized during early childhood for diarrhea. He took no medications and had no known medication allergies. Immunizations were current. He lived with his mother, stepfather, and brother in an urban area of New England and attended high school. He was born in Central America, had moved to the United States at 15 years of age, and had not traveled outside the country since that time. The family had frequent visitors from Central America. The patient had had a negative interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis 2 months before this evaluation. He was sexually active with one female partner and reported consistent condom use. Two months earlier, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia had been negative. He smoked one cigarette each day, used marijuana three times per week, and drank alcohol intermittently. He had a pet rabbit but no contact with other animals, no history of recent tick or mosquito bites, and no contact with sick persons. There was no family history of renal stones or autoimmune disorders. On examination, the patient appeared to be tired. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/67 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles of the low back were tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 2+ albumin and 1+ ketones by dipstick; there were few squamous cells and very few transitional cells per high-power field, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Cultures of blood and urine were negative, as were tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and urinary nucleic-acid tests forNeisseria gonorrhoeaeandChlamydia trachomatis. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ondansetron, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 4 hours, the fever, tachycardia, and pain resolved, and the patient was able to drink water without vomiting. He was discharged home and advised to continue taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ondansetron, as well as to rest, drink fluids, and follow up with his primary care physician in 2 days. Laboratory Data. The next morning, the patient awoke with severe pain in the abdomen, groin, and scrotum on the left side. Light-headedness, dysuria, diarrhea, and nausea persisted, and he vomited after each attempt to eat or drink. He returned to the emergency department, where he rated his pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He reported that 3 weeks earlier, he had had testicular trauma while attempting a stunt jump on his bicycle; the pain had resolved after approximately 30 minutes. On examination, he appeared to be uncomfortable, lying still on the stretcher. The temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/61 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness of the left costovertebral angle, the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, the left inguinal crease, and the superior aspect of the left testicle; there was no scrotal mass, edema, or discoloration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, and the level of C-reactive protein was 162.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Examination of the urine before and after prostatic massage revealed trace occult blood by dipstick in both samples, with otherwise normal results. Ultrasonography of the scrotum, kidneys, and bladder revealed an 8-mm cyst in the left epididymal head and no acute abnormalities. Ketorolac was administered. The patient\u2019s pain persisted, and the temperature rose to 38.9\u00b0C; acetaminophen was administered, and he was admitted to the hospital. On admission, the patient reported left scrotal pain and headache. His diarrhea had resolved. The temperature was 39.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/63 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild tenderness of the anterior and posterior left thigh; results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged from the assessment in the emergency department. Intravenous fluids, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered. The patient\u2019s urine was strained after each void; no stones were found. On the second hospital day, vomiting resolved but fever persisted and pain of the abdomen and groin worsened; morphine was administered as needed. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material (Figure 1A), revealed an ill-defined low-density material that tracked along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and aorta and into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the right. Low-density material was also seen in the left paracolic gutter. The radiologic differential diagnosis included infectious and inflammatory causes with a possible pelvic, leg, or genitourinary source or traumatic injury to the bladder or ureter. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and other visualized structures in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower thorax were normal. Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel A) shows an ill-defined low-density material that tracks along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and into the left paracolic gutter. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan (Panel B) shows several prominent inguinal lymph nodes, some with central necrosis. On the third hospital day, the patient continued to receive morphine for pain and acetaminophen for fever. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed two enlarged left external iliac lymph nodes (0.8 cm and 0.7 cm in short-axis diameter) and a heterogeneous, ill-defined, mixed echogenic collection located to the left of the bladder, a finding suggestive of loculated fluid or phlegmon. A chest radiograph was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed normochromic normocytic red cells, occasional symmetrical spindle-shaped red cells with smooth contours, very few burr cells, very few teardrop-shaped red cells, normal lymphocytes and monocytes, and normal platelets with occasional large forms. Results of renal-function tests and of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Tests for heterophile antibodies and IgM and IgG antibodies toEhrlichia chaffeensis,Anaplasma phagocytophilum, andRickettsia rickettsiiwere negative, as was a polymerase-chain-reaction assay forA. phagocytophilumDNA; results of tests for antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were suggestive of past infection. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and gentamicin were administered. On the fourth hospital day, the patient\u2019s pain decreased and his fever resolved.

56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough. Six weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home. Six days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient\u2019s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient\u2019s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact. On examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% at rest and 98% during ambulation, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative, as was testing for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus,Bordetella pertussis,B. parapertussis,Chlamydia pneumoniae, andMycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The procalcitonin level was 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.00 to 0.08). Intravenous fluids and acetaminophen were administered, and the heart rate decreased to 93 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to this hospital because of concerns that she had Covid-19. On the second hospital day, the patient had ongoing diarrhea, headache, and cough, along with fatigue. The temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 115/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The administration of intravenous fluids was continued. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a second nasopharyngeal specimen was negative. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 38.7\u00b0C. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed interlobular septal thickening, mild ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 1). CT of the Chest.An axial image in a lung window (Panel A) shows interlobular septal thickening (arrows) and mild ground-glass opacities (arrowhead) in the lower lobes. An axial image in a mediastinal window at the same level (Panel B) shows small bilateral pleural effusions (asterisks). During the next 3 days, the patient had ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. Fever persisted, and the oxygen saturation remained normal. Urine antigen testing for legionella andStreptococcus pneumoniaeantigens was negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and nucleic acid testing of a blood specimen for cytomegalovirus and Epstein\u2013Barr virus. Blood cultures remained negative. On the seventh hospital day, diarrhea resolved, but fever, myalgias, headache, and cough persisted. The physical examination was unchanged, with a normal oxygen saturation during ambulation. Chest radiography revealed no evidence of pneumonia. The procalcitonin level was 0.57 ng per milliliter; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Levofloxacin was administered.

The patient had been well until 5 days before admission, when head congestion, subjective fever, chills, and a nonproductive wet cough developed. He self-administered ibuprofen and acetaminophen, without improvement. One day before admission, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/69 mm Hg, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Rales and wheezing were heard in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A posteroanterior chest radiograph was clear (Figure 1A). Chest Radiographs Obtained at the Other Hospital.A posteroanterior chest radiograph that was obtained 1 day before admission (Panel A) is clear. An anteroposterior portable chest radiograph that was obtained on the day of admission (Panel B) shows new bilateral consolidations with nodular opacification that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, a finding consistent with pneumonia. A diagnosis of bronchitis was made. Albuterol and ipratropium were administered by nebulizer, and a 4-day course of prednisone was begun. The patient\u2019s symptoms reportedly improved, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue the prednisone course, begin therapy with an albuterol inhaler, and follow up with his physician. Approximately 24 hours later, relatives took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital because of cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting; he reported no chest pain. On examination, he was in severe respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 51/33 mm Hg, the pulse 165 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 79% while he was breathing ambient air. His skin was ashen and mottled, and he had diffuse rales in both lungs; the abdomen was soft, and there were no cardiac murmurs or edema. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A rapid influenza diagnostic test of a nasal swab was reportedly negative. Blood cultures were obtained. High-flow oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask and normal saline were administered. The oxygen saturation rose to 89% within minutes. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral consolidations with some nodular opacification that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung; some had nodular contours. The size of the heart was normal, and no pleural fluid or pneumothorax was seen (Figure 1B). An electrocardiogram revealed a ventricular rate of 161 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. A continuous infusion of norepinephrine was begun. Thirty minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, respiratory distress persisted, with labored breathing, nasal flaring, retractions, and diminished breath sounds throughout. Treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the oxygen saturation rose to 100%; the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, the blood pressure 102/85 mm Hg, the pulse 159 beats per minute, and the rectal temperature 40.7\u00b0C. Oseltamivir, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, clindamycin, methylprednisolone, and ketorolac were administered. Three hours 10 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival, the oxygen saturation was 88% while he was receiving treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure. He was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was begun. A triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was transported by medical helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 6 hours after his presentation at the other hospital. Additional history was obtained from family members. The patient had been well and was taking no medications until this illness developed. He had recently started spray painting buildings for work. He had no history of travel. He had visited the home of his adoptive parents the previous week; one relative had felt ill but the condition had since improved. On examination, the patient was unresponsive and cold to the touch. He had poor capillary refill while he was receiving ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen at a rate of 30 breaths per minute, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, a PEEP of 20 cm of water, and a tidal volume of 7 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. He had intermittent agonal spontaneous breaths over the ventilated breaths, and the oxygen saturation was 82% while he was receiving ventilatory support. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, and the femoral pulses were 125 beats per minute; when measurements of systemic blood pressure were attempted, no reading could be obtained. The height was 180 cm, the weight 76.2 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. The lips were blue. The breath sounds were diminished bilaterally, with diffuse rhonchi and poor air movement. The heart sounds were distant and tachycardic, without murmurs. The skin was cool and poorly perfused; there was no peripheral edema, and the abdomen was soft. Bloody respiratory secretions were suctioned. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lactase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed amber cloudy urine, with a specific gravity of 1.013, 2+ occult blood, 1+ glucose, and 2+ albumin; the urine sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 hyaline casts and 5 to 10 granular casts per low-power field, squamous cells, and mucin. Toxicologic screening of the urine revealed cannabinoids; screening of the blood and urine for other toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The rate of infusion of norepinephrine was increased, and dobutamine and vasopressin were added. Sodium bicarbonate, fentanyl, versed, propofol, vecuronium bromide, vancomycin, cefepime, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, and phytonadione were administered. Platelets were transfused. An indwelling catheter was placed transcutaneously into the femoral artery. Transthoracic ultrasonography, which was performed at the bedside, revealed diffuse decreased cardiac function, a decreased ejection fraction, and no evidence of right ventricular enlargement or pericardial effusion; hypotension persisted. Four hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was begun at the bedside. A portable chest radiograph that was obtained shortly after the patient was admitted to this hospital showed slight, gradual progression in consolidations bilaterally and showed the placement of an endotracheal tube, a central venous catheter, and a nasogastric tube (Figure 2A). On a radiograph that was obtained 4 hours later, an ECMO catheter was present in the superior vena cava and other findings were unchanged (Figure 2B). Chest Radiographs Obtained at This Hospital.A portable chest radiograph that was obtained on admission (Panel A) shows slight, gradual progression in bilateral pneumonia; an endotracheal tube is present in the trachea, a central venous catheter is present in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube is present in the stomach. A portable chest radiograph that was obtained 4 hours later (Panel B) shows the presence of a catheter for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation coursing through the inferior vena cava and terminating in the superior vena cava; the other findings were unchanged.

Results of postoperative MRI of the head suggested the presence of a residual tumor that extended into the right side of the genu of the corpus callosum. No adjuvant therapy was administered. The patient was monitored thereafter with serial MRI. On the current evaluation, the patient reported persistent fatigue and mild problems with short-term memory that had not changed over time, with no seizures. On further questioning, she reported that 17 years earlier, 5 years before she received the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, she had had a traumatic subdural hematoma that required evacuation, followed by a brief episode of arm and leg weakness and difficulty speaking. Phenytoin was administered for 6 months, and there were no recurrent events after it was discontinued. She had asthma. Her only current medication was carbamazepine. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and children. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother (who had died) had had cancer involving lymph nodes and had received chemotherapy, a sister (who was living) had had a tumor of unknown type that was removed from her neck, and a daughter had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. There was also a family history of hypothyroidism. The physical examination was normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 119 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100); a complete blood count and results of other routine laboratory tests were normal.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before this presentation, when intermittent fevers to a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C occurred, followed by episodes of cramping in the periumbilical and subumbilical abdominal regions, without vomiting. He had one or two bowel movements daily; the stools were formed, and hematochezia had occurred on one or two occasions. He had reportedly been unable to attend school for 2.5 weeks. Two days before this presentation, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, and urea nitrogen were normal, as were urinalysis and results of liver-function tests. Screening tests for celiac disease and Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed circumferential, moderate thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (with the largest lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in diameter), with no surrounding fat stranding. No dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest bowel obstruction or any other areas of bowel-wall thickening. The appendix was normal, and there was no abscess formation. Abdominal Imaging Studies.Contrast-enhanced axial and coronal CT scans (Panels A and B, respectively) show circumferential, moderate thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure (arrows) and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads). An ultrasound image (Panel C) shows circumferential, marked thickening of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure (arrows) and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads). The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. He reportedly had had intermittent, mild, self-resolving abdominal pain throughout childhood that was associated with diarrhea and was thought to be caused by lactose intolerance. He reported having a stable weight while he was consuming a regular diet (which included dairy) and occasional headaches but no joint pains or mouth sores. He had had frequent bouts of acute pharyngitis (\u201cstrep throat\u201d) during early childhood and had undergone a tonsillectomy at 19 months of age and sinus surgery in the past. His immunizations were current; he took no medications and had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with his parents. His father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his father\u2019s cousin had Crohn\u2019s disease, and a paternal uncle and great-grandfather had had colon cancer at 60 and 65 years of age, respectively. Both grandmothers had diabetes mellitus, and other relatives had heart disease. On examination, the patient appeared to be healthy and was in no distress. The blood pressure was 136/76 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the weight 48.6 kg, and the height 151.4 cm; his weight and height were both at the 96th percentile for his age. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with no organomegaly. An abdominal radiograph, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a normal bowel-gas pattern, and no dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest obstruction. Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1C) revealed circumferential, marked thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Color Doppler imaging studies showed increased blood flow in the affected segment of the colon. Additional follow-up was scheduled. During the next 10 days, the pain became more constant; the patient reported pain that waxed and waned between 5 and 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and occasional, brief pain-free intervals that lasted minutes. The pain varied in quality between cramping and sharp and was located below the umbilicus in both lower quadrants, with occasional radiation to the epigastrium and lower back. Eating increased the pain, and the patient lost approximately 3 kg of weight over several weeks. Hematochezia became more frequent. Intermittent fevers and associated night sweats occurred. There was no improvement with ibuprofen or acetaminophen; the combination of acetaminophen and codeine caused increased stomach distress, and a cold pack occasionally helped to decrease this discomfort. Eleven days after the patient presented to the gastroenterology clinic, his family called because of another episode of abdominal pain and associated low-grade fever. The family declined to have the patient seen urgently in the clinic. Diphenhydramine was prescribed, and the patient\u2019s family was advised to contact the clinician if symptoms worsened. Two weeks after the patient\u2019s initial presentation, he was seen at a scheduled follow-up appointment.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Nine months before this admission,Clostridioides difficilecolitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon. A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage. The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. At the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well. On examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild fullness in the pelvicalyceal system on the right side (Figure 1A) that is probably a physiologic finding in pregnancy. There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B). Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.A color Doppler ultrasound image of the right kidney shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system (Panel A) that is probably a physiologic finding in a pregnant woman. A sagittal color Doppler ultrasound image of the right lower quadrant (Panel B) shows trace fluid; however, the appendix is not visualized. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reveals a normal gravid uterus. A sagittal T2-weighted single-shot fast spin\u2013echo (SSFSE) image of the uterus (Panel C) shows rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity (arrow) that are consistent with focal myometrial contractions. A heavily windowed coronal T2-weighted SSFSE image of the uterus (Panel D) shows a thin band of low signal intensity (arrows) surrounding the fetus that is consistent with chorioamniotic separation, a normal finding in the first trimester. An axial T2-weighted SSFSE image of the abdomen (Panel E) and an axial image of the abdomen obtained with short-tau inversion recovery parameters (Panel F) reveal a normal appendix (Panel E, arrowheads) without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. The rectum, which can be seen in Panel C, shows no wall thickening, mural stratification, or proliferation of mesorectal fat, although evaluation of the bowel is limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material. Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care. The next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started. On the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.

The patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography. Three weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate. Five days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A contrast-enhanced coronal CT image in the pulmonary angiographic phase (Panel A) shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening compatible with pulmonary edema. A contrast-enhanced axial CT image in the pulmonary angiographic phase (Panel B) shows cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis in the lower lobes (arrows). A chest radiograph obtained at the time of transfer to this hospital (Panel C) shows interstitial pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, a trace left pleural effusion, and left basilar atelectasis. The venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) inflow cannula and the tip of a central venous catheter are visible in the right atrium, and an endotracheal tube and enteric tubes are in appropriate positions. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment. On arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit. On arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses.

During pregnancy, the patient\u2019s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother\u2019s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 \u03bcU per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes. Four weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus\u2019s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital (Figure 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6-cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), revealed displacement of the trachea without compression. Prenatal Imaging Studies.Ultrasonography and MRI of the fetus were performed at 35 weeks 6 days of gestation. An ultrasound image (Panel A) shows a 4.6-cm spherical mass on the right side of the neck. T2-weighted MRIs (Panels B, C, and D) show a single fetus in the vertex position (Panel B) with a spherical mass (Panels B and C, arrows; Panel D, asterisk) on the right side of the neck and displacement of the trachea (Panel D, arrow). For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The mother met with providers from Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present. The mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization. The patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay. At 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6. At 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed. At 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 \u03bcU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0).

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2021The neonatal reference range for hemoglobin is 13.5 to 19.5 g per deciliter. On ultrasonography of the head and neck (Figure 2A), the mass on the right side of the neck measured 3.7 cm by 3.8 cm by 3.1 cm and was markedly hypervascular, with lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. On MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the neck, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 2B and 2C), the mass appeared to arise from the sympathetic chain. Postnatal Imaging Studies.An ultrasound image of the neck obtained on the first day of life (Panel A) shows a mass with relatively homogeneous echotexture (left side) and internal color Doppler flow (right side), as well as lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and common carotid artery (CCA).

The patient had a history of a pelvic kidney and had otherwise been well until approximately 2 months before this admission, in the early spring, when high fevers occurred daily for 5 days, stopped for 4 days, and then recurred for 4 to 5 days. On examination by her pediatrician, a slightly erythematous tympanic membrane was reportedly present, as were labial adhesions, which precluded collection of a urine specimen for analysis or culture. A 10-day course of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was administered for possible otitis media or urinary tract infection, and the fevers resolved on the third or fourth day of treatment. Nine days before this admission, fever (with temperatures up to 40.6\u00b0C) occurred at night, with no other localizing symptoms. The patient was seen by her pediatrician the following day. The evaluation included urinalysis and culture of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization; these tests were reportedly negative. The fever recurred during the next 4 days, despite alternating treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and then resolved. Two days before this admission, in the afternoon, the temperature rose again to 40.6\u00b0C, with associated irritability. The next day, the patient returned to the pediatrician\u2019s office. On examination, the pharynx was slightly erythematous; the remainder of the examination, including assessment of the tympanic membranes, was normal. Analysis of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization revealed 1+ blood and trace protein and ketones by dipstick. The pediatrician advised the family to take the patient to the emergency department the next day for further evaluation. The parents reported that the patient had decreased oral intake; she drank only sips of breast milk and a rehydration solution with glucose and electrolytes. She did not have a cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash. She was born after a full-term gestation. Ultrasonography that had been performed while the patient was in utero had revealed a pelvic left kidney; since birth, she had been monitored by a nephrologist. Her growth and development had been normal, and she was crawling without difficulty during this illness. Her immunizations, including the influenza vaccination, were current; she had taken no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, older siblings, and a dog and two cats. She had no exposure to tuberculosis or sick contacts and had not traveled outside the country. Her father had Graves\u2019 disease, her mother had the polycystic ovary syndrome, her sister had had a urinary tract infection, and her brother had esophageal atresia and tracheomalacia. On examination, the patient was alert, had flushed cheeks, and did not have signs of sepsis. The temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The posterior oropharynx could not be visualized. Blood levels of glucose, ferritin, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and 1+ occult blood by dipstick, with 0 to 2 white cells and red cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field and amorphous crystals. Specimens of blood and urine, which were obtained by means of catheterization, were cultured. Screening of the nasal secretions for respiratory viruses was negative. Laboratory Data. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1A and 1B) show mild pulmonary hyperinflation and mild interstitial opacities, without a focal air-space opacity; these findings are consistent with reactive airway disease, or bronchiolitis. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Ultrasound images of the kidneys (Figure 1C and 1D) show that the right kidney (7.2 cm in length, in the renal fossa) and the left kidney (4.7 cm in length, in the left lower quadrant) have a normal appearance. There is no evidence of pyelonephritis, perinephric-fluid collection, abscess, hydronephrosis, or bladder abnormality. Imaging Studies Obtained in the Emergency Department.Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) show mild pulmonary hyperinflation and mild interstitial opacities. Ultrasound images of the abdomen and pelvis (Panels C and D, respectively) show that the right kidney has a normal appearance and location and that the left kidney, located in the pelvis, is ectopic but otherwise normal. In the emergency department, the temperature rose to 40.0\u00b0C. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy (placement of a chest tube for drainage) was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Gram\u2019s staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Two weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patient\u2019s family thought that she appeared somnolent and \u201cclumsy\u201d while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dyspnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 176/101 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter (29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter [35 to 97 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the hematocrit 26% (reference range, 34 to 45).

Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypodensities. Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydralazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency.

The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital. Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter. MRI of the Head.A diffusion-weighted imaging sequence shows foci of restricted diffusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Panel A) and the right frontal lobe (Panel B). Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. During the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazidime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies. Four decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been generally well until 6 years before presentation, when weight loss and pelvic pain developed and she requested HIV testing at a government clinic. HIV-antibody testing was positive. Four years 3 months before presentation, the CD4+ T-cell count was 193 cells per cubic millimeter (Table 1), indicating that the patient was eligible for antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Botswana. The white-cell count was 3400 cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 3900 to 8600), and the blood level of creatinine was 0.41 mg per deciliter (36 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.45 to 0.81 mg per deciliter [40 to 72 \u03bcmol per liter]). Two months later, treatment with a combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz was begun. At a follow-up appointment 1 month later, a gynecologic examination was performed to evaluate vaginal discharge, urinary frequency, and dysuria. Abnormalities were reported, and administration of a 10-day course of amoxicillin was begun. Pathological examination of the specimen obtained during a screening Papanicolaou (Pap) test revealed a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; however, the patient never received this result. Four months after the initiation of ART, the CD4+ T-cell count had improved (Table 1). Laboratory Data. One month later (5 months after the initiation of ART), the patient again reported dysuria; a course of nalidixic acid was administered. During the next 18 months, she continued to have recurrent pelvic pain, dysuria, and vaginal discharge. She sought care from traditional healers for these symptoms and postponed reporting the symptoms to her medical caregivers and undergoing a repeat Pap test, since she believed that the traditional therapies would help; the symptoms did not improve. Approximately 13 months before this presentation, the patient reported vaginal pruritus. Speculum examination revealed white patches on the cervix, and a repeat Pap test revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. One month later, on review of the test results, colposcopic examination with biopsy was scheduled for the next available appointment, which was 14 months later. Approximately 10 months before this presentation, a small amount of vaginal bleeding reportedly occurred each time the patient had sexual intercourse; the patient was referred for gynecologic evaluation. One month before this presentation, the complete blood count, the creatinine level, and tests of liver function were normal; other results are shown inTable 1.

The pulse was 157 beats per minute, with bounding radial pulses, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. The pupils were 5 mm in diameter. The skin was flushed, warm, and diaphoretic. A capillary glucose level was 268 mg per deciliter (14.9 mmol per liter). Soft restraints were applied, and oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital. En route, he suddenly became quiet, and a seizure was suspected. The administration of midazolam was attempted, but the patient pulled out the intravenous catheter. On arrival, the patient was unable to communicate. His history was obtained from his girlfriend. He had a history of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (including heroin, cocaine, and prescription opiates). His only medication was fluoxetine, which he reportedly had not taken for 2 weeks. He was allergic to shellfish and had no known allergies to medications. He smoked cigarettes. He lived with his girlfriend and had recently lost his job at a service station. He had a family history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was agitated, flailing his arms and legs, jerking his head, and making loud incomprehensible sounds. He was unable to cooperate during the examination and required restraining by several security officers. The temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/67 mm Hg, the pulse 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The skin was diaphoretic. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; the gaze was deviated upward, with slow, horizontal ocular movements. The patient's speech was rapid and mostly unintelligible, but he made references to attacking and being attacked by animals, people, and monsters. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity greater than 1.030, a pH of 5.5, 2+ occult blood, 1+ albumin, and trace ketones by dipstick. There were 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, few squamous cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field and few bacteria and 3 to 5 hyaline and granular casts per low-power field; mucin was present. Urinalysis was otherwise normal. The urine creatinine level was 3.50 mg per milliliter. Laboratory Data. The patient was restrained, and midazolam was administered intravenously, followed by lorazepam, but his condition did not improve. Etomidate and rocuronium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun, followed by sedation with propofol. A urinary catheter and an esophagogastric tube were inserted. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and the correct placement of the endotracheal and gastric tubes; changes consistent with pulmonary edema or pneumothorax were not observed. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or mass lesion. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 113 beats per minute, with inverted T waves in the inferior leads and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities in the lateral leads. Fomepizole, sodium thiosulfate, sodium bicarbonate, normal saline, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. The pulse fell to 92 beats per minute, and 290 ml of urine was excreted.

The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic cardiomyopathy and had a history of myocardial infarctions (an inferoposterior myocardial infarction, which had occurred 29 years earlier, and an apical infarction, which had occurred 14 years earlier and for which percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the first marginal branch of the left circumflex artery had been performed). Nine years before the current admission, a cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33% and a reversible anterolateral defect; subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the right coronary artery and in branches of the left circumflex artery. Seven months before the current admission, echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had worsened to 22%, and a subsequent cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging (performed at this hospital) revealed a markedly dilated left ventricle, with large, dense inferior and lateral scars and associated minimal inferoapical ischemia. Eleven weeks before the current admission, transthoracic echocardiography (performed at this hospital) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%, dilatation of the left atrium (anteroposterior dimension, 39 mm) and left ventricle (end diastolic dimension, 55 mm), diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles (mild in the right and severe in the left), mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion. Three weeks later (8 weeks before the current admission), the patient was seen in the cardiac-arrhythmia clinic of this hospital to be evaluated for the placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD). He reported exertional dyspnea that was consistent with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of II. He had no palpitations, presyncopal symptoms, syncopal events, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His weight was stable. His medications were aspirin, irbesartan, carvedilol, hydrochlorothiazide, isosorbide mononitrate, atorvastatin, metformin, sitagliptin, and loratadine. He was allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins, which caused a rash, and he reported cough with the use of angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. He was married and had adult children. He had a smoking history of 45 pack-years but had stopped smoking 29 years earlier, and he had recently decreased alcohol consumption from 10 drinks per week to 4 on the advice of his clinicians; he did not use illicit drugs. Several relatives had diabetes mellitus. On examination at that visit, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm of water; the remainder of the examination was normal, with no cardiac murmur or rub. Placement of an ICD was advised. Ten days before the current admission, a dual-chamber ICD system was inserted through the left axillary vein. Intravenous vancomycin was administered immediately before the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient was admitted to this hospital for routine monitoring. Chest radiographs that were obtained after the procedure and the following morning showed the ICD pulse generator on the left side of the chest, with ICD lead tips projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle, as well as clear and inflated lungs, mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (which was stable, as compared with the silhouette seen on earlier radiographs), and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The morning after ICD placement, repeat device interrogation was performed, and all measurements were within acceptable limits. The patient was discharged home later that day. During the next 9 days, he noted occasional mild positional pain at the ICD placement site that was relieved with acetaminophen. No skin changes or swelling at the ICD placement site were noted. Laboratory Data. At 6 p.m. on the day of the current admission, midsternal chest discomfort and associated diaphoresis and mild dyspnea developed suddenly while the patient was watching television. The pain was exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration, did not radiate, was possibly improved by leaning forward, and was distinct from the pain at the ICD placement site that had been previously reported. The patient had no associated headache, light-headedness, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills. He took two acetaminophen tablets for the pain, and after it lasted for more than 1 hour, he sought medical attention. On arrival in the emergency department, approximately 3.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient rated the pain at rest at 0 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The midsternal pain could be reproduced with deep inspiration; he rated that pain at 7 of 10. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The skin was cool, with no inflammation or hematoma over the ICD placement site. Adhesive strips over the incision were intact. The first and second heart sounds were normal, with no murmur, and the breath sounds were slightly diminished at the bases. The jugular venous pressure was not recorded, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Cardiac telemetry showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1) showed a new left pleural effusion, with no other clinically significant changes, as compared with the chest radiograph that was obtained immediately after the procedure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits, and the ICD leads appeared to be in a position similar to that on the previous radiograph. Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained on the current admission, show a new left pleural effusion. Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside by emergency department personnel, revealed trace pericardial effusion and decreased ventricular contractile function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute, with new ST-segment elevations in ECG leads II, III, aVF, V3, and V4(Figure 2). Aspirin, magnesium sulfate, and insulin were administered. Twenty-six minutes later, approximately 3 hours after the patient\u2019s presentation, severe pain recurred. Fentanyl was administered intravenously. Approximately 30 minutes after the onset of this pain, light-headedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and transient hypotension (blood pressure, 67/44 mm Hg) occurred, with a pulse of 59 beats per minute. These symptoms spontaneously improved within minutes; the systolic blood pressure rose to 92 mm Hg and subsequently ranged between 80 and 92 mm Hg, and the pulse ranged between 57 and 64 beats per minute. Vancomycin was administered. Five hours after presentation, the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. On arrival, the blood pressure was 120/55 mm Hg, and the pulse was 65 beats per minute, with an inspiratory decline in systolic pressure of less than 5 mm Hg. Breath sounds were diminished at the left base, the jugular venous pressure was 9 cm of water, and there were normal heart sounds, with no rubs or murmurs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. A repeat chest radiograph was unchanged, as compared with a radiograph obtained on admission. Electrocardiogram.An electrocardiogram, obtained on the current admission, shows sinus rhythm with 1-mm, concave ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and in leads V3and V4, along with T-wave inversions and flattening in the lateral leads. The changes in ST-segment elevations are new, as compared with the tracing obtained 10 days earlier.

Three days before the current presentation, he awoke at night with a severe coughing spell, with associated post-tussive emesis and trouble breathing. His parents took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, he appeared to be in no distress; the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucosa of the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance and the uvula was midline; there was no tonsillar edema or exudate. Nasal congestion, boggy nasal mucosa, and serous effusions behind both tympanic membranes were evident. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis with the upper-airway cough syndrome (postnasal drip) was made, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and benzonatate (200 mg three times daily) were prescribed. The next day, the patient continued to cough but was able to attend school. That night, he awoke from sleep with an episode of severe coughing that lasted approximately 10 minutes and was associated with two episodes of vomiting. He returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. He reported no chest pain, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, he appeared to be well and was not coughing; the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 151/87 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Mild nasal congestion and erythema of the posterior pharynx were present, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A presumptive diagnosis of bronchospasm was made. A dose of dexamethasone was administered for treatment of possible croup, and an albuterol inhaler was prescribed. The patient was advised to follow up with his pediatrician. During the next 2 days (a weekend), the cough persisted, without paroxysms; the night before the current presentation, the patient had two episodes of severe coughing, followed by inspirations with choking sounds. On the day of the current presentation, he attended school. His parents scheduled an appointment with his pediatrician at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for later that day. The patient reported epistaxis during his coughing episodes; his parents reported that they thought he was choking during the episodes. He did not have headaches, hearing problems, chest pain, shortness of breath other than with coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. He had a history of elevated systolic blood pressure and a body-mass index in the 94th percentile. He took no regular medications. He was fully immunized with childhood vaccines, including five doses of diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, four doses ofHaemophilus influenzaetype B vaccine, three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, and two doses of measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella vaccine (in infancy and early childhood), as well as two doses of meningococcal vaccine (at 11 and 16 years of age), one dose of tetanus toxoid\u2013reduced diphtheria toxoid\u2013acellular pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) vaccine (at 11 years of age), and one dose of human papillomavirus vaccine (at 16 years of age); there was no documentation of pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations.

The patient had been in her usual health until 1 month before this admission, when pain in the right shoulder and discomfort in the left lower abdomen developed. The shoulder pain worsened with inspiration and was associated with nonproductive cough, intermittent fevers (to a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C), sinus pain, nasal discharge, periorbital erythema, and difficulty breathing. Eleven days before this admission, she presented to another health center for evaluation. Physical examination reportedly revealed a new cardiac murmur. A chest radiograph showed a mass in the right middle lobe and a right pleural effusion. Six days before this admission, an axial computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest that was obtained at another hospital showed a homogeneous opacity (5.8 cm by 4.9 cm) extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular septal thickening in the right middle lobe, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, and a loculated right pleural effusion. The patient was admitted to that hospital, and thoracentesis was performed. Results of analysis of the serosanguineous pleural fluid (120-ml sample) are shown inTable 1. Culture of the fluid grewStaphylococcus lugdunensis. The patient was discharged home the next morning, with a prescription for a 5-day course of azithromycin and cefpodoxime. She was referred to the thoracic surgery service at this hospital for further evaluation and bronchoscopy. Pleural-Fluid Analysis. On presentation 5 days later, bronchoscopic evaluation revealed erythema in the right bronchus intermedius and bronchus of the right middle lobe, with no endobronchial lesions or secretions. Microbiologic testing and cytologic examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid from the right middle lobe were nondiagnostic. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported headaches and pain along the diaphragm and right shoulder on deep inspiration. At 17 years of age, she had had hydrocephalus due to a web in the aqueduct of Sylvius that resolved after temporary placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt and performance of an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Temporal-lobe epilepsy later developed and was caused by a right mesial temporal cavernous malformation that was successfully resected. A second cavernous malformation in the cerebellum had been stable on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 8 years earlier. She had visited Switzerland, California, and Michigan during the previous year, and she had visited Cuba 10 years earlier. She was married and worked in a research field, with exposures to yeast and mice 2 years earlier. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma. On examination, the temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the other vital signs were normal. Decreased breath sounds in the right lung and a soft cardiac murmur were present. The examination was otherwise normal. An axial CT scan of the chest, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed a homogeneous opacity (5.8 cm by 4.9 cm) extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular septal thickening in the right middle lobe, a nodule (3 mm in diameter) in the right upper lobe, atelectasis in both lower lobes, and a loculated right pleural effusion that was bigger than that seen on the scan obtained 6 days earlier (Figure 1). CT Scans Obtained on the First Admission.Axial CT scans of the chest, obtained at the lung window setting (Panel A) and the soft-tissue window setting (Panel B), show a homogeneous mass in the right middle lobe that causes occlusion of the bronchi (Panel A, arrow). A small right pleural effusion and relaxation atelectasis in the right lower lobe are also visible. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 2. Vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered for 1 day after the bronchoscopy. Peripheral-Blood Laboratory Data. The next day, a chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space, and 1600 ml of yellow pleural fluid was drained; results of pleural-fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. Cytologic examination of the fluid revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils but no malignant cells. On the fourth day, the chest tube was removed. The patient was discharged home the following day, with a prescription for a 3-week course of ceftriaxone. During the next month, follow-up imaging studies of the chest showed increasing nodular thickening of the right major fissure, a left pleural effusion, and a decreasing right pleural effusion; the findings were otherwise stable. Pathological examination of specimens obtained from a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core biopsy of the large mass in the right middle lobe showed mixed inflammation, with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Microbiologic staining and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. One month after admission to this hospital, symptoms persisted and the patient was readmitted for further evaluation. She reported a dry cough, dyspnea, generalized fatigue, weakness, and pain in her shoulders, neck, and lower back. Medications included narcotic analgesic agents, ranitidine, calcium carbonate, and acetaminophen. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were decreased bilaterally; the decrease was greater on the left side than on the right. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.18 liters (37% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity of 1.40 liters (36% of the predicted value), a peak expiratory flow rate of 4.25 liters per minute (65% of the predicted value), and a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity corrected for alveolar volume of 3.47 ml per minute per millimeter of mercury per liter (62% of the predicted value). Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were normal; other test results are shown inTable 2. Urinalysis was normal. Chest radiographs showed a mass in the right middle lobe, a patchy left basilar opacity that was consistent with atelectasis, a stable right pleural effusion, and a moderate left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the left pleural space. Cytologic examination of serosanguineous pleural fluid (75-ml sample) revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils; other test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, thoracoscopy, lobectomies of the right middle and lower lobes, total pulmonary decortication, and dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes were all performed with the use of video-assisted techniques. Pathological examination revealed evidence of extensive lipoid pneumonia (i.e., the accumulation of lipids in the alveoli) and fibrinous pleuritis. The patient had no complications associated with the procedures and was discharged home 5 days later. During the next 5 months, the patient had persistent dyspnea on exertion and pain in the inferior portion of the chest that was thought to be musculoskeletal. Chest radiographs showed postoperative changes and pleural effusions, without infiltrates. Six months after the first admission to this hospital, examination revealed crackles, for which an antibiotic agent was administered; the symptoms improved. Three weeks later, cardiopulmonary testing with the use of a modified Bruce protocol, performed at rest and after 12 minutes of exercise, revealed pulses of 96 and 151 beats per minute and oxygen saturations of 99% and 88% (while the patient was breathing ambient air), respectively. Two weeks later, at an outpatient visit, the patient reported night sweats, persistent cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 2. A chest CT that was obtained during that visit showed new bilateral, subpleural ground-glass and reticular opacities. Subpleural nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe and consolidation in the medial right lung around the bronchial stump were present (Figure 2). CT Scans Obtained 7 Months after the First Admission.Coronal (Panel A) and axial (Panels B and C) CT scans of the chest show subpleural ground-glass opacities and reticulation (Panels A and B, arrowheads), as well as consolidation in the medial right lung around the bronchial stump and in the left lower lobe (Panels A and C, arrows). Bronchoscopy was performed, and cytologic examination and microbiologic testing of the BAL fluid were nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry revealed 34% granulocytes, a finding consistent with inflammation. Chest pain, which the patient rated at 5 out of 10 at rest and 8 out of 10 with deep inspiration and coughing (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain), persisted despite administration of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, glucocorticoid therapy, and a narcotic analgesic agent. One week later, pain in the right hip developed, without a known injury. The following week, examination revealed pain on active flexion of the right hip. Test results are shown inTable 2. MRI of the hip, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right superior labral tear with a surrounding inflammatory change (2.0 cm by 1.7 cm) along the proximal right iliopsoas muscle and a left adnexal cyst (4.0 cm by 2.5 cm); there was no evidence of fracture or osteonecrosis. MRI of the pelvis was performed; T2-weighted images showed an abnormal signal that extended along the right iliac vessels and involved the adjacent medial right psoas and iliacus muscles, with no fluid collection.

The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Eleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.

The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended. Seven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed, given the patient\u2019s diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloroquine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexamethasone and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pressure gradually decreased (Figure 1A). Sixteen minutes after induction began, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenylephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit. Intraoperative Vital Signs.Vital signs were recorded during two separate episodes of hypotension with concurrent ST-segment elevation after the administration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the induction of anesthesia that preceded the first attempted procedure (Panel A), there was a gradual onset of hypotension over a period of 10 to 15 minutes for which the patient received doses of vasopressors that were higher than those typically used to restore normotension. During the induction of anesthesia that preceded the second attempted procedure (Panel B), there was an abrupt and profound drop in the systolic blood pressure immediately after the administration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. Dexamethasone was administered to treat possible adrenal insufficiency, and epinephrine was administered in escalating doses, followed by an infusion. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer during the first induction and through an arterial catheter during the second induction. Intraoperative Telemetric Monitoring.Intraoperative telemetric monitoring performed during the patient\u2019s hypotensive episodes shows ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF, with reciprocal depressions in leads I and aVR, during the administration of anesthetics before the first attempted procedure (Panel A) and during the administration of anesthetics before the second attempted procedure (Panel B). On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9); 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.

On the day of the current presentation, she was again taken to the operating room to undergo transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative blood pressure, as measured through an arterial catheter, was 118/67 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Sedation with fentanyl and midazolam was started, topical lidocaine was used to anesthetize the airways, and fiberoptic tracheal intubation was performed while the patient was awake.

Approximately 4 months before presentation, the patient was admitted to a hospital in her home state for \u201cpounding\u201d in her chest, nausea, and diaphoresis that persisted for 40 minutes after a routine jog. The heart rate was 65 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 138/72 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. Four serial electrocardiograms were reportedly normal, but the troponin I level was elevated, at 0.055 ng per milliliter, and 11 hours later, it had risen to 0.415 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal biventricular function. Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mm Hg. After discharge (4 days after admission), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed normal biventricular function and size, with no evidence of myocardial edema or fibrosis. Aspirin and a beta blocker were prescribed for presumed exercise-related supraventricular tachycardia. The symptoms did not recur, and the patient returned to jogging and stopped taking the beta blocker. On the day before her transfer to this hospital, she was on a downhill-skiing trip in Vermont. In the morning, she felt fatigued. In the afternoon, palpitations, dyspnea, and weakness developed while she was at the top of a mountain; the ski patrol took her down the mountain, and the symptoms abated. In the evening, while she was at dinner, she had acute nausea and emesis followed by chest pain and dyspnea. She was taken to a local emergency department. The heart rate was 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air. Auscultation revealed diffuse crackles in the lungs. The troponin I level was 11.000 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045), the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 15,159 pg per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 125), the lactate level 4.6 mmol per liter (41.0 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), the venous blood pH 7.22 (normal range, 7.38 to 7.46), and the white-cell count 36,100 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000). Bedside cardiac ultrasonography revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning. Intravenous infusions of heparin and furosemide were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to a nearby tertiary care center for treatment of suspected cardiogenic shock. On the patient\u2019s arrival at the tertiary care center, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 143 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air and 88 to 94% while she was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. On physical examination, she appeared fatigued and had jugular venous distention, diffuse crackles in the lungs, and cold arms and legs. The troponin I level was 4.790 ng per milliliter (normal range, <0.034), the white-cell count 30,240 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000), the arterial blood pH 7.08 (normal range, 7.35 to 7.45), the lactate level 5.9 mmol per liter (53 mg per deciliter; normal range, <2.0 mmol per liter [<18 mg per deciliter]), the NT-proBNP level 24,900 pg per milliliter (normal range, <300), and the creatinine level 1.41 mg per deciliter (125 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range for women, 0.52 to 1.04 mg per deciliter [46 to 92 \u03bcmol per liter]). Chest radiography revealed diffuse pulmonary edema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and T-wave inversions in leads V4through V6. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated for respiratory failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and left ventricular apical akinesis, as well as severe right ventricular apical dysfunction. Infusions of norepinephrine, dobutamine, epinephrine, amiodarone, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. Empirical methylprednisolone was administered for presumed myocarditis. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 38 mm Hg. A percutaneous transaortic left ventricular assist device was placed. After the institution of mechanical circulatory support, the intravenous doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were tapered and eventually stopped. Hematuria developed, and the urine output declined. The blood pressure was labile, ranging from 60/40 to 140/110 mm Hg, and an infusion of sodium nitroprusside was administered for control of elevated blood pressure. The patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital. On the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from her husband. She had a history of thyroid cancer (unknown pathologic subtype) that had been treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation. Medications included levothyroxine and a calcium supplement. The use of cefadroxil had caused the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed in health care, was married, and had one healthy daughter. Her maternal grandfather had died from myocardial infarction at 60 years of age, her father had had an aortic-valve replacement, and her mother had had lung cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 105/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 12; tidal volume, 400 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0; respiratory rate, 16 breaths per minute). The pupils were reactive to light in a symmetric but slightly sluggish manner. The patient was able to follow simple commands. She had no masses in the neck or exophthalmos. The jugular veins appeared distended. Auscultation of the chest revealed the hum of the ventricular assist device, distant tachycardic heart sounds, and scattered crackles in the lungs. The ventricular assist device had been secured in place by way of the left groin. She had 1+ pedal edema bilaterally and no rash or lymphadenopathy. A small amount of reddish brown urine was noted. Levels of thyrotropin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood.

Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia, poor R-wave progression, T-wave inversions in leads V3through V6and in inferior leads, low QRS voltage, and a prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval (Figure 1). Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrates, small bilateral pleural effusions, and the tip of the ventricular assist device projecting over the left ventricle. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with an estimated ejection fraction of 20% and severe mid-to-apical hypokinesis, as well as right ventricular free-wall and apical dysfunction, no clinically significant valvular disease, and a small pericardial effusion (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained. Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis. Initial Imaging Studies of the Chest.An axial chest CT image obtained 5 months before the current admission (Panel A) shows layering secretions within the trachea (arrow), as well as a patulous esophagus (asterisk). An additional axial image from the same CT examination (Panel B) shows bronchial wall thickening (arrows). A frontal chest radiograph obtained 3 months before the current admission (Panel C) shows patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. A frontal chest radiograph obtained 1 month before the current admission (Panel D) shows patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. A test forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level. Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora andCandida albicans; a test forPneumocystis jiroveciiwas negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora andC. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes. Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination. Subsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.A frontal chest radiograph obtained 1 week before the current admission (Panel A) shows multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which are confluent in the right lower lobe. Axial (Panel B) and coronal (Panel C) chest CT images obtained 1 week before the current admission show new multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity; there are scattered areas of consolidation (arrows) that are most prominent in the right middle and lower lobes. A frontal chest radiograph obtained during the current admission (Panel D) shows progression of the diffuse reticulonodular opacities bilaterally, with additional patchy opacities throughout the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the previous chest radiograph obtained 1 week earlier. Axial (Panel E) and coronal (Panel F) chest CT images obtained during the current admission show increased diffuse centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity, patchy ground-glass opacities (arrow), and additional areas of consolidation (arrowheads) that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung; these findings indicate a progression of disease, as compared with the chest CT images obtained 1 week before the current admission (Panels B and C). The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora andC. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus,P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forM. tuberculosiswas also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later. Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts.

Approximately 4 years before this evaluation, the patient had undergone an unspecified hand surgery. Immediately after the procedure, hydromorphone was administered. After the patient was discharged home, he initially sought out more prescription opioids and then switched to intravenous heroin because he found it to be less expensive and more easily obtained. During the next 3 years, he injected 1 to 2 g of heroin each day. One year before this evaluation, after the patient lost his job, he attempted to quit using heroin. He began to take methadone, which helped to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but he stopped taking it after 10 days because he was concerned that weaning off methadone after a period of maintenance treatment would be associated with unacceptable adverse effects. He then resumed heroin use. Six months before this evaluation, the patient again stopped using heroin and was admitted to an inpatient, medically supervised detoxification program for management of withdrawal symptoms. After 2 weeks, he was discharged home. Approximately 2 months before this evaluation, the patient was released from jail and was admitted to a structured residential rehabilitation program, in which he participated in work therapy, attended regular Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and underwent random, intermittent urine toxicology screenings. He continued in this program and abstained from opioid use until 3 days before this evaluation, when he resumed intravenous heroin use. He obtained the drug, which he believed to be mixed with fentanyl, from a single dealer and began to inject 0.5 g at a time using clean needles and cotton filters. On the day of this evaluation, the patient injected 0.5 g at 10 a.m., followed by another 0.5 g at approximately 1:30 p.m.; he remembered subsequently walking around a park and placing a phone call to a friend to arrange a meeting. At 2:44 p.m. on the day of this evaluation, emergency medical services personnel were dispatched to the park, where the patient was found lying on the ground in a puddle of slush. He was unresponsive. The patient\u2019s friend was present and reported that when he had found the patient, he had administered intranasal naloxone and then called for emergency medical assistance. First responders from the fire department had administered a second dose of intranasal naloxone before emergency medical services personnel arrived. On examination, the patient appeared cyanotic, and he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 (on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating lower levels of consciousness). The temperature was 35.6\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 4 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 80% while he was breathing ambient air. He had pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing. An oropharyngeal airway was placed, and positive-pressure ventilation was initiated with the use of a bag\u2013valve\u2013mask device. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 164 mg per deciliter (9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Several minutes later, the patient woke up, removed the oropharyngeal airway, and was noted to be alert and oriented, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported that the overdose was unintentional, that he had never had an overdose before, that this incident was a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d and that he wanted help with managing his opioid addiction. He had been feeling sad after the recent deaths of his mother and grandmother, and he thought that his relapse in opioid use might have been related to these stressors. He had no history of other medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known allergies. He was a high-school graduate and had worked as an electrician before he became unemployed. He was single and had no children. He had smoked a half-pack of cigarettes daily for the past 4 years and had smoked marijuana when he was younger. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs other than heroin. There was no family history of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or suicide. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. His clothes were wet. The temperature was 35.9\u00b0C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There were scattered focal crackles in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, the anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. The blood glucose level was 165 mg per deciliter (9.2 mmol per liter). Venous blood gas measurements, which were obtained while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, included a pH of 7.29 (reference range, 7.30 to 7.40), a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 68 mm Hg (reference range, 38 to 50), a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 28 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 50), a bicarbonate level of 32 mmol per liter (reference range, 24 to 30), and a base excess of 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 3.0). An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and was otherwise normal. A portable anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Figure 1) revealed cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature and fluid in the minor fissure, findings consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There were also bilateral nodular and patchy airspace opacities, findings that suggested superimposed aspiration.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when headache, fatigue, and myalgias developed. During the next 2 days, she felt generally unwell, and the headache did not diminish with the use of acetaminophen. Five days before admission, she felt feverish, but her temperature (measured at home) was 37.8\u00b0C. The frequency of bowel movements increased from a baseline of one to three movements per day to five to eight per day; the color of the stool remained brown, but the consistency became looser, and the stool occasionally contained small amounts of mucus and blood. Two days before admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician for evaluation. The hemoglobin level was reportedly 8 g per deciliter (reference range, 12 to 16); 6 weeks earlier, the level had been 13 g per deciliter. A provisional diagnosis of a flare of Crohn\u2019s disease was made, and prednisone and intravenous fluids were administered. One day before admission, the hemoglobin level was reportedly 7 g per deciliter, and the patient was asked by her gastroenterologist to stop taking prednisone and to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache, fatigue, and myalgias but no dyspnea on exertion or palpitations. She had a history of infertility, and 4 weeks before admission, she had completed one cycle of intrauterine insemination after the administration of follicle-stimulating hormone. She did not become pregnant, and the last menstrual period began 2 weeks before admission, with menstrual flow that was heavier and of longer duration than the flow of previous menstrual cycles. The patient had received a diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease 9 years before admission. Two years later, cytomegalovirus colitis developed while she was receiving infliximab and azathioprine, and her treatment was changed to infliximab monotherapy. Two years before admission, she had evidence of persistent inflammation on endoscopy, and her treatment was then changed to vedolizumab. Eight weeks before admission, the frequency of the vedolizumab dose was increased after the stool calprotectin level was found to be elevated. The patient also had a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis with normal hepatic synthetic function, stable diffuse intrahepatic disease, and no evidence of a clear dominant stricture on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography performed 3 months before admission. In addition to vedolizumab, medications included cetirizine and a prenatal multivitamin with iron. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived in New England, worked as an engineer, and was of Asian Indian descent. Her 3-year-old son attended day care regularly. Ten days before admission, fever and an erythematous facial rash had developed in the son; he was not evaluated by a medical provider and recovered after 2 days. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was alert and oriented. The sclerae were anicteric, and the conjunctivae were pale. The oropharynx appeared normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. She did not have a rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation; there was no splenomegaly. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The arms and legs did not have edema. A rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, folate, vitamin B12, and fibrinogen were normal, as were results of kidney-function and coagulation tests. The total bilirubin level was 1.1 mg per deciliter (19 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 \u03bcmol per liter]); it had increased from a baseline level of 0.3 to 0.7 mg per deciliter (5 to 12 \u03bcmol per liter). Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.003 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035) and a pH of 6 (reference range, 5 to 9) and was negative for glucose, blood, protein, bilirubin, and urobilinogen.

The patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospitalizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine. Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed. Five years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction. During the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment). Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence. Initial MRI of the Head.An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) and a T2-weighted image (Panel B) show an old lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata (arrowhead), mild scattered hyperintensities suggestive of small-vessel ischemic changes (arrows), and mild generalized brain parenchymal volume loss. Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months. Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine. One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. During the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms. The patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 year before admission, when olfactory hallucinations (including sulfur and burning odors) developed, along with associated nausea. Episodes occurred every few days and lasted for approximately 2 minutes. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, transient daily episodes of numbness and paresthesias on the left side began. Results of a neurologic examination performed at another hospital were reportedly normal.

Levetiracetam was administered for management of suspected focal seizures, and the patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation. The patient was right-handed. He had pain associated with left molar caries (for which a root canal was planned) and a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. He reported no changes in his skin or vision, joint pain, dry mouth, decreased lacrimation, or respiratory symptoms. During childhood, he had had ophthalmologic surgery on his left lens after an injury. Medications included levetiracetam and dextroamphetamine. He had no known allergies. He lived alone and worked in an office. He drank alcohol in moderation, had smoked cigarettes briefly more than 10 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He was of both African-American and Caribbean ancestry, was born in the United States, and had not traveled to the Caribbean.

An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and met the voltage criteria for left-ventricular hypertrophy in the precordial leads. A chest radiograph was normal. MRI of the head was performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1).

The patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia. Sixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due toMycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness. The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis. The blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%.

He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed. At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60).

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive.

Two months before presentation, she was seen by her physician at another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal.

The patient\u2019s dose of levothyroxine was increased from 50 \u03bcg to 75 \u03bcg daily. One week later, generalized unsteadiness developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the use of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or infarct and was unchanged from imaging studies obtained 1 year earlier. Approximately 1 month before the current evaluation, fatigue markedly worsened, and diffuse muscle aches developed, which were associated with pain that radiated down both legs. Nine days before this evaluation, the patient went to the emergency department at the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/69 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiration rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, total protein, and albumin; results of renal function tests were also normal. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was advised that her symptoms were not consistent with Lyme disease and was instructed to see her primary care physician for further evaluation. Laboratory Data. Four days later, on examination at her physician\u2019s office, the patient reported recent night sweats that were so drenching that she had had to change her nightgown. On examination, the blood pressure was 141/69 mm Hg, and the abdomen was soft and slightly distended; the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were normal; additional test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent atelectatic changes in both lungs (Figure 1), a low-attenuation lesion (measuring 15 mm in diameter) that was consistent with a hepatic cyst (with no biliary-duct dilatation), splenomegaly (maximal span, 15 cm [normal span, \u226413]), a renal cyst that appeared to be benign, atherosclerotic calcifications, and osteopenia. No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis was seen. Computed Tomographic Image of the Abdomen and Pelvis.A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows an enlarged spleen (maximal dimension, 145.7 mm) without a discrete focal lesion. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital. On evaluation, she reported feeling tired and having intermittent muscle aches and night sweats. She reported no abnormal bleeding, bruising, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, change in appetite or sleeping pattern, weight loss, rash, pruritus, or known recent tick bite. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, a history of babesiosis, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections; she also reported having had depression after the death of her husband. A diagnosis of Lyme disease had been made 14 months earlier, when she presented with erythema migrans and fatigue. Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for a period of 2 weeks) was administered, and the rash resolved. Two months later, body aches and night sweats developed but resolved after a brief period; testing for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiand polymerase-chain-reaction assays forBabesia microtiandAnaplasma phagocytophilumnucleic acids were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. She had had a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse, unilateral oophorectomy after an ectopic pregnancy, lumbar laminectomy, partial colectomy for diverticulosis, and bilateral total knee replacement. Daily medications and supplements included aspirin (81 mg), losartan, atorvastatin, calcium (40 mg), levothyroxine, celecoxib (200 mg), vitamin D, a multivitamin, cranberry tablets, and latanoprost ophthalmic solution, as well as lorazepam (0.5 mg, as needed) at night. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived alone in a coastal area of New England and had retired after working in education. She was physically active. She drank two alcoholic beverages each evening, had stopped smoking more than 50 years earlier after casual use, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and sister had died of lung cancer, and her mother had died when she was older than 90 years of age. Her adult children were healthy. On examination, the patient looked younger than her stated age. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/62 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiration rate 18 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.4. The tip of the spleen was felt 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin, and there was trace edema in both ankles. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of tests of coagulation and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, and uric acid. Additional test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in his usual health, with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, until approximately 8:30 on the morning of admission, when his girlfriend found him lying on the floor of his home, unresponsive; she called emergency medical services (EMS). Shortly thereafter, he regained consciousness, rose to sit in a chair, and reported chest pain and dizziness. He took two nitroglycerin tablets (sublingually). On examination by EMS personnel at 8:42 a.m., he was alert and oriented and appeared uncomfortable; he had pale and diaphoretic skin and was grasping at his sternum and moaning. He reported that he had taken his regular daily aspirin (325 mg, orally) earlier. Respirations and pulse were normal; a faint carotid pulse was palpated; jugular venous distention was not visible. In the ambulance, cardiac monitoring revealed a sinus rate of 56 beats per minute, without ectopy. Nausea and vomiting developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute, and intravenous catheters (18 gauge) were inserted into the antecubital vein in the right arm and a vein in the left forearm. At 8:50 a.m., the blood pressure was 110/90 mm Hg, the pulse 51 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98%, with the patient reporting chest pain rated at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute; ST-segment elevation of 2 to 3 mm in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and in leads V3through V6and of 2 mm in right-sided leads V4and V5; and ST-segment depression with T-wave inversion in leads aVL, V1, and V2. Transport to this hospital began at 8:52 a.m. Three minutes later, the patient vomited, became increasingly pale and diaphoretic, and was unresponsive to voice. Normal saline (a 500-ml bolus) was administered. An attempt at tracheal intubation was unsuccessful. However, since a gag reflex was present, a nasopharyngeal airway was inserted instead, without complication. Thereafter, the patient was noted to be breathing on his own. The ambulance arrived at the hospital at 9:04 a.m. The patient had a history of coronary artery disease with unstable angina; 12 years before admission, at another hospital, a bare-metal stent (3.0 mm by 24.0 mm) had been placed in the middle portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the level of bifurcation with the first diagonal artery. Seven years later, angina recurred, and a nuclear stress test was positive for anterior ischemia; repeat cardiac catheterization at the other hospital revealed obstructing lesions (95% and 60%) in the left circumflex artery, and two drug-eluting stents were placed. Medications the patient was taking before admission were unknown; in the past he had reportedly taken atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and aspirin (325 mg) daily. He had reported no allergies. The patient was divorced and lived with his girlfriend, with visits by his children. He worked in the construction and entertainment industries. Family members reported that he drank alcohol in moderation and had stopped smoking 11 years earlier. There was a family history of coronary artery disease. In the emergency department triage area, the patient was alert and oriented; the blood pressure was 110/90 mm Hg, and the pulse 70 beats per minute. Within seconds after he arrived, the pulse decreased to 36 beats per minute and the width of the QRS complexes on the cardiac monitor increased. External pacing was attempted, without mechanical capture. Seizure activity occurred briefly, and runs of ventricular tachycardia with wide ventricular complexes were seen; the blood pressure and carotid pulses could not be obtained, and the patient was unresponsive. The cardiac monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was begun, and the patient was moved to a resuscitation bay. The plasma level of total carbon dioxide was 19.5 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), the anion gap 17 mmol per liter (reference range, 3 to 15), the level of phosphorus 2.3 mg per deciliter (0.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]), and the level of glucose 145 mg per deciliter (8.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of a complete blood count and tests of liver and renal function; screening for troponin I was negative. During resuscitation, the trachea was intubated. Amiodarone and lidocaine were administered intravenously and nine direct-current countershocks were administered.

As a child, the patient had had difficulty with articulation and had received speech therapy. When he was approximately 12 years of age, dental crowding and class III dentofacial growth pattern were noted (class I growth pattern indicates normal development, class II indicates protrusion of the maxilla, and class III indicates protrusion of the mandible), and between 12 and 16 years of age, the patient had orthodontic braces and a palate expander. After the braces were removed, difficulty eating and chewing reportedly worsened. Eight weeks before this evaluation, he was referred to the outpatient Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department at this hospital. On examination, the patient had frontal bossing, downward-slanted lateral canthi, symmetric hypoplasia of the midface and maxilla, and relative mandibular hyperplasia (i.e., hyperplasia of the mandible relative to the size of the maxilla and midface) (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a negative overjet of more than 10 mm (i.e., the mandibular teeth extended more than 10 mm horizontally beyond the maxillary teeth), and the lower teeth were retroclined. The ears were in a normal position, but they protruded outward. He was referred to the medical genetics clinic for evaluation of a possible genetic cause of these and other skeletal abnormalities. Clinical Images.A photograph (Panel A) shows mild frontal bossing, downward-slanted lateral canthi, low-set and protruding ears, and severe midface hypoplasia and maxillary retrognathia. A lateral cephalogram (Panel B) shows frontal bossing, severe midface retrognathia, negative overjet (with the lower teeth extending more than 10 mm horizontally beyond the upper teeth), and impacted 12-year molars. Findings were similar in both eyes. A second photograph shows the right eye before pharmacologic dilation (Panel C). The anterior chamber was determined to be shallow, because the vertical light beams on the iris (blue arrow) and cornea (pink arrow) were very close to each other. When the border of the right pupil (Panel D, white arrow) was enlarged by pharmacologic dilation, the entire lens perimeter (orange arrow) was seen, suggesting microspherophakia. There is a mixed chest-wall defect (Panel E) with a midsternal, funnel-shaped pectus excavatum defect and lower sternal protrusion with accompanying protrusion of parasternal cartilages (Panel F, red arrow). The patient was born at full term by vaginal delivery; his birth weight was 4.3 kg. A pectus excavatum was present at birth. His height was at the 80th percentile until he was 15 years of age, after which it plateaued at the 55th percentile. No developmental delays were noted during childhood. An intermittent systolic heart murmur, which was graded 3 out of 6 (with 1 indicating a soft murmur and 6 indicating a loud murmur) had first been noted when the patient was 13 years of age. Evaluations by three cardiologists during the next 4 years revealed no cardiovascular symptoms or decreased capacity; electrocardiograms showed an indeterminate axis, and echocardiographic studies reportedly revealed a normal aortic-root size and no evidence of anomalous vasculature, atrial septal defect, valvular structural abnormalities, or findings suggestive of Marfan\u2019s syndrome. The murmur was thought to be turbulence related to the position of the heart in relation to the pectus deformity. On cardiogenetic examination performed at another hospital when the patient was 16 years of age, his weight was 69.2 kg, the height 177.8 cm, the arm span 188 cm, the ratio of arm span to height 1.06, and the ratio of upper to lower body segment 0.87. Pectus excavatum of the upper chest and pectus carinatum of the lower chest were seen, as were broad thumbs, with no evidence of joint hypermobility. Although there was insufficient evidence to diagnose Marfan\u2019s syndrome, a connective tissue abnormality was suspected. He was referred to a medical geneticist, but his family acknowledged that they were focused on the craniofacial evaluation. When the patient was 13 years of age, a diagnosis of myopia was made, and eyeglasses were prescribed by his optometrist. Over the course of the next 4 years, examinations performed at the optometrist\u2019s office showed an increase of 12.75 diopters of myopia in the right eye and an increase of 11.00 diopters in the left eye. Nine months before this evaluation, his manifest refraction was reportedly \u221213.75 diopters in the right eye and \u221210.00 diopters in the left eye. Eight months before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the ophthalmology clinic at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. On examination, his right eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of \u221214.50 diopters and his left eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of \u221211.00 diopters. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes when the patient was wearing eyeglasses. The anterior chambers were shallow (Figure 1C), and the angles were open on gonioscopy. The lenses were rounder and smaller than normal, and the lens perimeters and zonules were clearly visible in both eyes after dilation (Figure 1D). The findings on ultrasound biomicroscopy were consistent with microspherophakia (small, spherically shaped lenses) (Fig. S1 in theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), with lens diameters of 8.41 mm in the right eye and 8.03 mm in the left eye (normal diameter, >9 mm). Lens thickness values were 4.97 mm in each eye. Axial lengths were 24.15 mm in the right eye and 23.91 mm in the left eye. Ultrasonography confirmed shallow anterior chambers, with anterior chamber depths of 2.20 mm in the right eye and 2.82 mm in the left eye (normal depth, >3.00 mm). The patient had had no serious childhood illnesses. He had bilateral epididymal cysts that had been stable for many years, had undergone repair of urethral meatal stenosis, had had an impacted fracture of the wrist owing to a sports-related injury when he was 12 years of age, and had transient musculoskeletal back pain. He was not taking any medications. He had received all routine childhood immunizations and was allergic to melons. He lived with his parents and brother, and he did well in school. He had never used tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s brother, who was 3 years older than the patient, had a deep asymmetric pectus excavatum and a history of sports-related injuries, including several ankle injuries and recurrent avulsion of a hip joint associated with kicking. He did not wear eyeglasses and had no unusual facial features except for a mild underbite. The patient\u2019s mother was of Irish and Italian ancestry, and his father was of Italian, Portuguese, Irish, and Scottish ancestry; there was no known consanguinity. His father and multiple paternal relatives had hypertension; his paternal grandfather had coronary artery disease, his grandmother had an endocrine brain tumor, his aunt had Crohn\u2019s disease, and an uncle had arthritis. His mother was healthy, his maternal grandmother had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and a cousin had celiac disease. His mother, maternal grandmother, and aunt were 165 cm tall; his brother and maternal grandfather were 170 cm tall; and his father was 175 cm tall. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal. The weight was 66.3 kg (48th percentile), the height 177.5 cm (58th percentile), and the head circumference 58.5 cm (98th percentile). There was slight frontal bossing. The conjunctivae were clear, and the sclerae were white, without blue or gray hue. There was a mixed chest-wall defect, with funnel-shaped pectus excavatum and lower sternal protrusion with protrusion of parasternal cartilages (Figure 1E and 1F). A harsh, grade 3 systolic murmur was heard at the upper sternal border, without systolic click or diastolic murmur. There was loss of the normal upper curvature of the spine, as well as scoliosis, with the scapula and rib cage on the right side higher than the left. The remainder of the examination was normal or unchanged from recent previous examinations. The patient had above-average intelligence and was reserved. He asked thoughtful questions and consented to the proposed evaluations. Radiographs of the skeleton, including hands and feet, showed straightening of the normal cervical lordosis, rotatory S-shaped dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis, and generalized osteoporosis, with biconcavity of the end plates of multiple vertebral bodies, also known as \u201cfish\u201d or \u201ccodfish\u201d vertebrae (Figure 2A).1,2 Imaging Studies.Lateral view of the lumbar spine (Panel A) reveals concave superior and inferior end-plate depressions (identified by the arrows at L2) at multiple lumbar levels, giving rise to the appearance of \u201ccodfish\u201d vertebrae. As measured with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (Panel B), the total bone mineral density of the spine averaged over L1 through L4 was 0.75 g per square centimeter (indicated in the graph by the circle with a cross). This value was 2.7 SD below the expected normal value for the patient\u2019s age, corresponding to a z score of \u22122.7. The graph displays the age-related normal values with 95% confidence intervals. The gray area represents the median to the 95th percentile, and the black area represents the median to the 5th percentile. The intersection of the gray and black areas is the median. A z-score value lower than \u22122.0 indicates osteoporosis, and a value between \u22122.0 and 0 indicates osteopenia. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (Figure 2B) revealed an abnormally low bone mineral density of 0.75 g per square centimeter averaged over vertebral bodies L1 through L4; when compared with age-matched controls, this value resulted in a z score of \u22122.7, which is indicative of osteoporosis.", "true_dx": "Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase deficiency.", "pred_dx": "...the name of the disease/entity...", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "<|im_start|>assistant", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's tackle this case.", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The patient is a 17-year-old male with several key features.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "First, he has severe myopia, which is over -10 diopters in both eyes.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a big clue.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Then there's the craniofacial abnormalities: frontal bossing, downward-slanting lateral canthi, midface hypoplasia, and a class III dentofacial pattern (which is a protruding mandible).", "t": 1, "c": "17", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The skeletal issues include pectus excavatum combined with pectus carinatum, which is a mixed chest wall defect.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Also, the x-rays show \"codfish vertebrae,\" which are those biconcave vertebral bodies.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, he has osteoporosis with a very low bone density z-score.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His eyes also show microspherophakia, which is a small, spherical lens.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's another red flag.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The family history isn't super strong for similar issues, but his brother has pectus and some joint problems.", "t": 5, "c": "6", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The father has hypertension and other relatives have various conditions, but nothing that jumps out as a clear genetic link yet.", "t": 5, "c": "6", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, thinking about differential diagnoses.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Marfan syndrome was considered but ruled out because of normal aortic root and no joint hypermobility.", "t": 5, "c": "13", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The key features here are the combination of severe myopia with microspherophakia, midface hypoplasia, the specific vertebral changes (codfish vertebrae), and the mixed pectus deformity.", "t": 5, "c": "5", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Wait, Stickler syndrome comes to mind.", "t": 4, "c": "14", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Stickler is known for eye issues like myopia, cataracts, and retinal detachment, along with midface hypoplasia and cleft palate sometimes.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But does it have the vertebral changes?

The patient, who lived and worked in a city in Vietnam, had been well until approximately 1 month before the current admission, when episodes of throbbing discomfort in the right upper quadrant (described as \u201crolling spasms\u201d) developed; the episodes lasted for approximately 20 to 30 minutes at a time and resolved without treatment after 5 days. Approximately 2.5 weeks before the current admission, fevers, shaking chills, and body aches developed; the patient took ibuprofen but the symptoms did not improve. The next day, he was seen by a physician at an infirmary for international persons. Acetaminophen was administered; the fever reportedly abated, and the patient returned home. During the night, the temperature rose to 40.6\u00b0C, with rigors. He returned to the infirmary and was admitted to one of two inpatient beds. The patient had previously been well. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and had two young children. He was born in and had lived in New England until 10 years earlier, when he moved to Vietnam. He was a professor at an academic institution in Massachusetts. He lived in an urban apartment complex and took occasional trips to Cambodia and New England. He had not traveled during the previous month. He had received all the indicated vaccines before moving to Vietnam and had had no recent exposure to sick persons. A physical examination was reportedly normal. The bilirubin level was reportedly mildly elevated, and laboratory tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),Salmonella typhiH and O antigens,S. paratyphiAH and BH antigens, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, parasites, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, antigens to influenza virus types A and B, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis and a chest radiograph were normal. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and omeprazole were administered, without improvement. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose intermittently to 41.0\u00b0C, with rigors. A transthoracic echocardiogram reportedly showed trace mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial dilatation. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a mildly enlarged liver (midclavicular longitudinal dimension, 17 to 18 cm; upper limit of normal, 13 to 15 cm) and splenomegaly (length of the spleen, 14.9 cm). On the third day at the infirmary, results of computed tomography (CT) of the chest were normal; CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed an enlarged liver and spleen. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. On the fourth day at the infirmary, fevers persisted. On the recommendation of a physician in Massachusetts, the patient was transferred to an international hospital in Thailand. On admission, the blood pressure was 140/78 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the temperature 38.1\u00b0C (several hours after acetaminophen had been administered), and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time and estimated glomerular filtration rate were normal, as were the red-cell indexes and blood levels of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and globulin. Tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria (by means of polymerase-chain-reaction assay), influenza virus types A and B, HIV, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly turbid urine, with 1+ protein and blood, urobilinogen, and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 5) and was otherwise normal. A stool examination was reportedly negative for parasites. Radiographs of the chest and paranasal sinuses were reportedly normal; a radiograph of the abdomen, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a small calcification at the left side of the pelvic cavity that was thought to be a phlebolith or bladder stone. CT images of the abdomen that were obtained at the infirmary were reviewed and thought to show hepatosplenomegaly. Potassium chloride was administered. During the patient\u2019s first full day at the international hospital (the seventh day of the febrile illness), abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly, a hepatic cyst (0.9 cm in diameter) at segment VI, and a hyperechoic nodule (1.7 cm in diameter) at the right lobe, anterior to the inferior vena cava, that was thought to represent a hepatic hemangioma. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to between 38.0\u00b0C and 39.8\u00b0C. On the fourth hospital day, doxycycline therapy was begun for possible rickettsial infection. Later that day, one of three blood cultures that had been obtained on the day of admission grew gram-positive cocci in chains; the cocci were identified asStreptococcus constellatus, subspeciesconstellatus. Ceftriaxone therapy (2 g daily) was begun, and doxycycline therapy was stopped. The next day, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of endocarditis; the ejection fraction was 62%. The patient began to feel better. On the sixth hospital day, after 12 days of illness, fevers resolved. Repeat blood cultures were sterile. Blood levels of electrolytes, globulin, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The physician in Massachusetts recommended that the patient undergo additional testing. On the seventh hospital day, CT of the abdomen (performed after the intravenous, oral, and rectal administration of contrast material) reportedly revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, multiple hypodense nodular lesions in the liver, enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic head, and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. Specialists in hematology and gastroenterology were consulted. Endoscopic ultrasonography was scheduled, and anticoagulation was begun. The CA 19-9 level was normal. On the 11th hospital day, CT images were transmitted to this hospital for review.

The patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myocardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibrillation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission. Seven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral artery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarction involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe. Although continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patient\u2019s strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixaban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was discharged home on the second hospital day. Four days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head (performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material) and MRI of the head (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day. Three weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and withdrawn affect. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally. CT of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed diffuse emphysematous changes, including a spiculated mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney. Initial Imaging Studies.Two weeks before the current admission, CT of the chest and abdomen was performed with the administration of contrast material. An axial image from CT of the chest (Panel A) shows a mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung (arrow). A coronal image from CT of the abdomen (Panel B) shows an exophytic hypodense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney (arrow). On the current admission, CT angiography and MRI of the head were performed. A maximum-intensity-projection image from CT angiography (Panel C) shows calcification of the carotid siphons but no radiologically significant stenosis. An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image from MRI (Panel D) shows confluent low attenuation of the periventricular white matter and corona radiata (arrow). An axial diffusion-weighted image from MRI (Panel E) shows multiple new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the left lentiform nucleus, and the right frontal white matter (arrows). On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home. Three days after discharge from the rehabilitation center, and 1 week before the current admission, numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm developed, and the patient\u2019s daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treatment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxaparin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Five days after discharge, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and difficulty with balance had worsened since discharge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications included enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some difficulty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Pronator drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and rheumatoid factor were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5); the remainder of the complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Thed-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. CT angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1C), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right cerebral peduncle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in multifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intracranial arteries. MRI of the head (Figure 1D and 1E), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left subinsular region, the medial right precentral gyrus, the anterior right frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyri, and the right temporal lobe. There were also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and T2-weighted imaging, findings that are indicative of moderate small-vessel disease. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous heparin was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until midday on the day of admission, when he was in a fast-food restaurant and gasped suddenly, with full-body shaking and loss of consciousness. The shaking movements ceased quickly, but he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services personnel arrived after approximately 4 minutes, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. The heart rhythm was identified as ventricular fibrillation; four shocks were delivered, and the patient received intravenous naloxone, amiodarone, and a bolus of epinephrine followed by a continuous infusion. A slow, wide-complex heart rhythm with a rate of 40 beats per minute was noted, reportedly with concurrent return of mental status, but CPR had to be resumed after pulselessness recurred. The patient arrived at this hospital 30 minutes after the initial arrest. The patient was an unresponsive, middle-aged man who had undergone mechanical CPR and had no external signs of trauma. Empirical intravenous calcium chloride, dextrose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. In addition, vasopressin, norepinephrine, rocuronium, and ketamine were administered intravenously, and aspirin was administered rectally. Emergency intubation of the trachea was performed, and an orogastric tube, a femoral arterial catheter, and a femoral central venous catheter were placed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure 1A) showed uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular contractions; possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves. Initial ECGs, CT Scan of the Head, and Cardiac Catheterization Studies.Electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained on presentation (Panel A) and after the return of spontaneous circulation (Panel B) show uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular contractions (white arrows); possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves (black arrows). An axial computed tomographic (CT) image of the head (Panel C), obtained without the administration of contrast material, was normal, without evidence of infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions. Images from a left coronary angiogram (Panel D) and a right coronary angiogram (Panel E) show only minimal luminal irregularities. Initial laboratory test results obtained 25 minutes after the patient arrived at this hospital are shown inTable 1. Cardiac ultrasound images obtained at the bedside showed marked global left ventricular dysfunction. Spontaneous circulation was restored; the heart rate was 108 beats per minute and the blood pressure 139/92 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous epinephrine and norepinephrine. A repeat ECG (Figure 1B) showed findings similar to those seen on presentation.

A repeat examination, performed after the medications used for sedation were discontinued, revealed anisocoria and sluggishly reactive pupils (the left was 7 mm in diameter, and the right was 5 mm); corneal reflexes and response to noxious stimuli were absent. Therapeutic hypothermia was not initiated. Computed tomography of the head (Figure 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed preservation of differentiation between gray and white matter, without evidence of territorial infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a transaortic percutaneous ventricular assist device was placed through the femoral artery, and thereafter, the patient was weaned from epinephrine and norepinephrine. Coronary angiography (Figure 1D and 1E) revealed only minimal luminal irregularities (seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Subsequent catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 27 mm Hg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation was 85%. Additional laboratory test results returned during the catheterization procedure (Table 1) were notable for a blood potassium level of 2.0 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.4 to 5.0). The patient received 60 mmol of enteral potassium chloride and 80 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride. Three hours after the patient arrived at this hospital, he was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), whereupon limited additional history was available from family and friends. There was no history of chest pain, dyspnea, or symptoms of heart failure or dysrhythmia. He had a poor diet, consisting primarily of several packages of candy daily; 3 weeks earlier, he had switched the type of candy he was eating. He had no sick contacts, fever or chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Medical history included previous heroin use disorder and untreated hepatitis C virus infection. The patient had never had any adverse drug reactions. He worked in construction. He did not drink alcohol, he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 36 years, and he had reportedly been abstinent from opiates for the previous 3 years. There was no family history of cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic, or endocrine disease. The temperature was 34.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 81/53 mm Hg (on the percutaneous ventricular assist device), and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.50; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 450 ml). On examination, he was unresponsive; the pupils remained sluggishly reactive and asymmetric. No cough or gag was noted, and corneal reflexes remained absent. There were no lacerations on the tongue. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and intermittently irregular, but no murmur was noted. The skin was warm, without rashes or bruises. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, amylase, lipase, and carboxyhemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Potassium chloride (at a dose of 40 mmol) was administered intravenously. An ECG (Figure 2A) showed sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicular block and left bundle-branch block, as well as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. Additional Cardiac and Imaging Studies.An ECG obtained on the patient\u2019s arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) (Panel A) shows sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicular block (white arrow) and left bundle-branch block (black arrow), as well as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. A portable chest radiograph (Panel B) shows appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube, the pulmonary-artery catheter, and the percutaneous ventricular assist device. The lungs are clear, and the cardiac silhouette is normal in size.

The patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hospital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis. Two days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish-brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation. On the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal discharge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not recently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a diagnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Medications included finasteride, tamsulosin, carbidopa\u2013levodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grandmother and macular degeneration in his sister. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.9. Visual acuity without glasses was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Results of Ishihara color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse conjunctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the frontal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodium level of 125 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). Results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and face (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tissue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and extending superiorly along the superficial soft tissue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated. CT of the Head and Face.Axial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in soft-tissue algorithm (Panels A and B) show marked edema of the left eyelids and preseptal soft tissues superficial to the left orbit (Panel A, arrows) and fluid and edema within the frontal scalp (Panel B, arrow). No postseptal inflammatory changes are present; the normal and symmetric appearance of the orbital fat is consistent with findings on a representative coronal image reconstructed in soft-tissue algorithm (Panel C). A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel D) at the same anatomical level as the representative image shows nearly complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with thickening and sclerosis of the walls of the right maxillary sinus (arrow), findings consistent with chronic sinusitis. A defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus (arrowhead) is consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses bordering the left orbit, are well aerated. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, and topical bacitracin\u2013polymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead (Figure 2). Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started. Clinical Photographs.Panel A shows a rash located predominantly in the left cranial nerve (V1) dermatomal distribution, mainly involving the left side of the forehead and left upper eyelid, with partial demarcation at the midline of the forehead (arrows). There is clinically significant edema of the eyelids, which is more pronounced on the left side than on the right side. Of note, the nose is spared. Panel B shows involvement of the frontal scalp (arrow). Panels C and D show multiple grouped and confluent violaceous eroded papules with hemorrhagic and serous crust with underlying erythema (arrows).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed multilevel degenerative changes, multiple enhancing lesions in the lumbar spine and left iliac bone, and compression fractures of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, findings consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Two months before this presentation, swelling and pain in the hands occurred, followed by pedal edema, tightening of the skin of the hands and feet, and diffuse hyperpigmentation on the trunk, arms, and legs. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide was begun, but it was stopped during the first cycle because of worsening symptoms. Diffuse joint pain occurred and hyperpigmentation increased. One month before this presentation, on evaluation in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital, the red-cell indexes and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, thyrotropin, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and folate; other test results are shown inTable 1. Total urine protein was 90 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells or amyloid. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid insufficiency, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64% and showed that the ascending aorta was 41 mm in diameter (reference diameter, <36 mm); there was no evidence of amyloid or pericardial effusion. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory Data. On presentation, the patient rated the joint pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, low-back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease; he had undergone colonic polypectomies and had a history of prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy was performed 11 years earlier. Medications included acyclovir, rosuvastatin, and omeprazole. Allopurinol caused a rash. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He had stopped smoking 20 years earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/63 mm Hg and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. A systolic murmur, grade 2/6, was heard at the right and left upper sternal borders. There was swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally and swelling below the knees to the toes, without erythema or warmth. The range of motion was decreased in the metacarpophalangeal and ankle joints. The skin on the metacarpophalangeal joints and legs below the knees to the toes was hyperpigmented. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 54.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); testing for antibodies to Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Sm, RNP, Jo-1, Scl-70 (topoisomerase I), and cyclic citrullinated peptide was negative, and the level of creatine kinase was normal. A tapering course of prednisone was administered. Five weeks later, after returning from a vacation in Aruba, the patient was seen for follow-up appointments at the hematology clinic of the other hospital and the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. He reported severe fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and weight loss of approximately 3.5 kg. He rated the joint pain at 2 out of 10, but substantial stiffness persisted while he was taking prednisone. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 100 to 111 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints remained swollen but were less tender, and the wrists were slightly full. There was 1+ pitting edema below the knees; the skin was deeply tanned and firm in a manner that was out of proportion to the degree of pitting edema. Test results are shown inTable 1. The stool was dark brown and positive (3+) for blood. The administration of omeprazole was increased to twice daily, and an endoscopic examination was scheduled. One week later (six weeks after this presentation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening anemia (Table 1). The hematocrit rose to 27.9% after leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. Endoscopy revealed severe acute gastritis with marked erythema and friability. He was discharged on the third day. During the next 2 months, melena and anemia persisted. Colonoscopy at the other hospital revealed a benign polyp, 5 mm in diameter, which was excised. Multiple units of red cells were transfused, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered monthly, with some improvement in joint pain and stiffness. Skin tightness persisted, and a skin biopsy was performed. Examination of histologic sections of a punch-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a fibrosing dermopathy, with interstitial mucin deposition and collagen expansion of the dermis extending to the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 1A). The epidermis appeared normal. Adnexal atrophy with loss of surrounding fat was identified. A sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat (Figure 1B). There were areas of marked fibroblast hypocellularity in the middle and deep reticular dermis, with diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells (Figure 1C). A colloidal iron stain revealed finely granular mucin deposits interspersed between dermal collagen bundles (Figure 1D). An elastic-tissue stain revealed preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with straightening and parallel arrangement (Figure 1E). Skin-Biopsy Specimen.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections of a skin-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a normal epidermis with dermal collagen expansion involving the subcutaneous tissue (Panel A, asterisk); there is adnexal atrophy with periadnexal fat loss (Panel A, arrow). A sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was identified at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat (Panel B, arrow). There were areas of reticular dermal fibroblast hypocellularity (Panel C). An immunohistochemical stain for CD34 shows a diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells (Panel C, inset). A colloidal iron stain shows interstitial mucin deposits (Panel D). An elastic-tissue stain shows preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with parallel arrangement and straightening (Panel E, arrow). Three months after this presentation, prednisone was administered for persistent stiffness. The patient reported extreme fatigue and increasing dyspnea on exertion during the preceding 3 months. Results of tests performed at the other hospital are shown inTable 1. Chest imaging was performed because of the worsening shortness of breath. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed reticulation in the subpleural region at the lung bases and bronchiolectasis (Figure 2A). There was no evidence of pulmonary edema. These findings were suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Soft-tissue windows showed a small pleural effusion on the right side and minimal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery that could be correlated with pulmonary hypertension (Figure 2B). The esophagus was diffusely dilated and contained contrast material throughout. A representative sagittal image showed generalized osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions throughout the spine and ribs, and multiple healed fractures, including one in the sternum (Figure 2C). These skeletal findings were consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. CT Scans of the Chest.A CT scan of the chest with lung windows, obtained through the lung bases with the patient in the prone position, shows subpleural reticulation, ground-glass opacities, and bronchiolectasis (Panel A). A scan with soft-tissue windows, obtained with the patient in the supine position, shows a small pleural effusion on the right side, diffuse distention of the esophagus with air and liquid, and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (measuring 3.5 cm in diameter) (Panel B). A scan with bone windows, obtained in the sagittal plane, shows diffuse osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions in the spine, and a healed fracture of the body of the sternum (Panel C). The patient was admitted to this hospital 3.5 months after this presentation. On examination, there were bilateral bronchial breath sounds, crackles at the base of the left lung, extensive hardening of the skin from the hands to the elbows and from the toes to above the knees, and deep bronze discoloration on the trunk, arms, and legs. Joint motion was limited by skin thickening. Test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 4 months before the current admission; he had been admitted to this hospital then because of dyspnea, cough, rib pain, flank pain, and one episode of hematuria that had reportedly occurred 1 week earlier. On examination, the vital signs were normal; there were rales in the bases of both lungs and a systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Urinalysis showed no evidence of blood. Imaging studies that were performed during that hospitalization included chest radiography and computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. These studies revealed basilar atelectasis, changes consistent with mild congestive heart failure, and a new subpleural nodular opacity (1.3 cm in diameter) in the right middle lobe (Figure 1A). There was also bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (Figure 1B). Imaging Studies of the Chest.CT scans of the chest that were obtained 4 months before the current admission (Panels A and B) show a new nodular lesion in the right middle lobe along the major fissure (Panel A, arrow), as well as bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (Panel B, arrow). A CT scan of the chest that was obtained on admission (Panel C) shows multiple small pulmonary nodules, findings that were unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (arrow). One month later, an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography scan (Panel D), which was obtained at the level of the carina, shows marked FDG avidity throughout the bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow). During that admission, the patient\u2019s cough, dyspnea, and flank pain improved with supportive care. At discharge, recommendations included outpatient follow-up with CT of the chest, cytologic examination of a urine specimen, and possible cystoscopy. Four months later, on the day of the current admission, the patient was seen in a clinic affiliated with this hospital for a follow-up visit. He reported that two episodes of hematuria had occurred during the previous 2 months, with fatigue but no fevers, chills, numbness, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, trauma, or infection. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, mild cognitive decline, and choreiform movements. He had undergone aortic-valve replacement and repair of an aortic aneurysm 2 years earlier; he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a reportedly negative evaluation 6 years earlier. His medications included donepezil hydrochloride, citalopram, tamsulosin, ranitidine, quetiapine, aspirin, psyllium, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had lived in South America for 10 years; he had immigrated to the United States when he was in his 40s. He lived with his wife and was retired after working in the construction and food industries. He maintained a low-salt and low-cholesterol diet, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier, had stopped drinking alcohol 1 month earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had had asthma and a myocardial infarction at 62 years of age, his mother had had heart failure in her 70s, a brother had had a stroke in his 80s, and his son had died in his 30s because of arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; his other children were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 108/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a systolic murmur, grade 1/6, was heard at the left base. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline. The platelet count and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.009, a pH of 5.5, and trace albumin by dipstick, and was otherwise normal. After the test results were known, the patient was advised to go the emergency department of this hospital. Laboratory Data. In the emergency department, the patient reported diffuse nonradiating lower abdominal pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He also reported severe constipation, increasing urinary frequency over a period of 1 week, decreased oral intake, weakness and fatigue of 1 month\u2019s duration, and weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 3 months. He had no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or leg swelling. On examination, the blood pressure was 149/65 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower quadrants, without rebound, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and vitamin A were normal, and testing was negative for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies and antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies; additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Repeat urinalysis revealed 1+ occult blood and albumin by dipstick; examination of the urinary sediment revealed 0 to 2 red cells and white cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field. The urinary sodium level was 55 mmol per liter, the creatinine level was 0.44 mg per milliliter (3890 \u03bcmol per liter), and the osmolality was 329 mOsm per kilogram of water. A chest radiograph revealed a tortuous calcified aorta, evidence of aortic-valve replacement, and no evidence of pneumonia or effusion. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 50 beats per minute; the results were otherwise unchanged from earlier tracings. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Normal saline was infused, and salmon calcitonin was administered. The calcium level decreased to 13.4 mg per deciliter (3.35 mmol per liter), at which time the ionized calcium level was 1.73 mmol per liter (6.92 mg per deciliter; reference range, 1.14 to 1.30 mmol per liter [4.56 to 5.20 mg per deciliter]). Two additional liters of saline were infused. On the second day, hemodialysis was performed, and the ionized calcium level decreased to 1.27 mmol per liter (5.08 mg per deciliter). The next day, pamidronate was administered. During the next 8 days, additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, many of which were subpleural (Figure 1C). The nodules were unchanged from imaging studies obtained 2 years earlier, and the new nodule in the right middle lobe that had been seen on the previous study had resolved. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right renal cyst (2.9 cm in diameter) and an enlarged prostate. A bone scan showed no evidence of bone metastases. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed bilateral colloid cysts but no extrathyroid nodules. A skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, with lucent lesions in the calvarium and possibly the mandible, as well as subtle, indeterminate lucent lesions in the legs that raised concerns about multiple myeloma or metastatic cancer. Cytologic examination and culture of the urine were negative. On the sixth hospital day, testing for cryoproteins was negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen showed 7% plasma cells and an increased number of monoclonal plasma cells with kappa light chains. The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day; sodium bicarbonate was added to his previous medication regimen. Eleven days later (21 days after the current admission), at an outpatient visit, additional test results were obtained (Table 1). The next week, 1 month after the current admission,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) revealed marked FDG avidity in the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1D). Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital because of worsening renal failure. Levels of complement (C3 and C4) were normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Sm, and RNP; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A renal biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the renal-biopsy specimen revealed two glomeruli with global sclerosis (out of the six examined), interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy affecting 30% of the cortex. The principal finding was a focal but dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells that was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, with some histiocytes and plasma cells and without eosinophils. There were foci of tubulitis that was characterized by disruption of basement membrane by the inflammatory cells (Figure 2A). Interstitial fibrosis resulted in tubular atrophy (Figure 2B). These findings indicate chronic active tubulointerstitial nephritis. In addition, localized collections of histiocytes were present. The epithelioid character of the histiocytes, as well as their circumscription, can be described as granulomatous or as poorly formed granulomas (Figure 2C).1The glomeruli that were observed in the renal-biopsy specimen were normal apart from the global sclerosis in areas of inflammation (Figure 2D). Renal-Biopsy Specimen.Pathological examination of a renal-biopsy specimen was performed. Panel A (hematoxylin and eosin) shows foci in which the renal cortex is largely replaced with inflammation and fibrosis (some within the outline); the inflammation is lymphocytic and plasmacytic. Panel B (Masson trichrome) shows focal sclerosis (blue) and atrophic tubules (T) in areas of fibrosis.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when fever developed, with a temperature of up to 39.9\u00b0C and associated shaking chills. He had a poor appetite and was eating and drinking less than usual. Three days before admission, he stopped using long-acting insulin for his diabetes because fasting blood glucose levels were less than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). One day before admission, a dry cough developed. On the morning of admission, the patient noticed shortness of breath. He called his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing shortness of breath, with no chest pain, orthopnea, or leg swelling. He had not traveled recently. He worked as a limousine driver but had not had known contact with anyone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. A drug-eluting stent had been placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery 7 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, ezetimibe, glipizide, insulin glargine, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, rosuvastatin, and testosterone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. He lived with his girlfriend in a suburb of Boston. His family history included coronary artery disease in his father and emphysema in his mother. On examination, the temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 37.1. The patient had moderately increased work of breathing and diffuse coarse crackles at the lung bases. The mucous membranes were dry. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood creatinine level of 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) was higher than the level obtained 1 year earlier (0.8 mg per deciliter [71 \u03bcmol per liter]).

A chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department showed bilateral multifocal patchy opacities, a finding suggestive of pneumonia (Figure 1A). Chest Radiographs.A chest radiograph obtained on admission (Panel A) shows bilateral multifocal patchy opacities, a finding suggestive of pneumonia. A chest radiograph obtained 1 day before continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated (Panel B) shows evidence of an increase in bilateral consolidation and interstitial opacities, a finding suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Also shown are an endotracheal tube in the trachea, a catheter in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube in place. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, along with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Three hours after admission, the oxygen saturation decreased to 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 92% with the administration of oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Five hours later, shortness of breath increased and the oxygen saturation decreased, and the oxygen flow rate was adjusted to 6 liters per minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Intravenous vancomycin and furosemide were administered. The nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA returned positive. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started, and the patient was enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov number,NCT04280705). Sixteen hours after transfer to the ICU, the patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for persistent tachypnea and worsening oxygen saturation. During the next 24 hours, hypotension developed, with the blood pressure decreasing to 78/45 mm Hg, and treatment with intravenous norepinephrine was initiated. On hospital day 3, the creatinine level increased to 1.8 mg per deciliter (159 \u03bcmol per liter), and the patient\u2019s participation in the clinical trial of remdesivir was discontinued.

swelling of the left jaw. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started. Eighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluctuance, or palpable salivary stones. Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital. CT Images of the Face.Axial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel A) and in soft-tissue algorithm (Panel B) show an expansile, multiloculated mass centered in the left mandibular body (Panel B, arrows) with internal wavy septations. A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel C) shows defects in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible with involvement of the alveolar process and the left mandibular first molar. Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal. Clinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.Frontal and submental views (Panels A and B, respectively) show the expansion of the left mandibular body laterally and inferiorly. Five days later, at the evaluation in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, the lesion had enlarged (Panels C and D). An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma. Surgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens.Enucleation of the mandibular lesion was performed through an intraoral incision in the buccal vestibule lateral to the teeth (Panel A). The lesion was easily separated from the thin, expanded cortical margins. The inferior alveolar nerve (arrow) was preserved. The high vascularity of the tumor imparts a red-brown appearance to the lesion that is typical of brown tumors and other giant-cell\u2013rich lesions (Panel B). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the initial maxillary tumor\u2013biopsy specimen before excision (Panel C) shows a nodule of the brown tumor that is partially surrounded by trabeculae of reactive bone. The solid tumor is hemorrhagic and contains osteoclasts. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the maxillary tumor specimen after excision (Panel D) shows that the tumor is hypercellular and is composed of spindle cells admixed with numerous osteoclasts that tend to cluster around areas of extravasated red cells. Approximately 3 weeks after excision of the tumor, parathyroidectomy was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the left upper parathyroid gland specimen (Panel E) shows an enlarged parathyroid gland that measures 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The gland weighed 1500 mg. The specimen was hypercellular, with a diffuse growth pattern, and was composed of chief cells with a rim of normocellular parathyroid tissue (Panel E, arrows). Immunohistochemical staining for parafibromin andCDC73(Panel F) shows preservation of parafibromin andCDC73by the adenomatous cells and by the cells within the rim of normocellular parathyroid tissue (arrows). Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells. On the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).

The patient had been well until 3.3 years before this presentation, when episodic bilateral epistaxis developed, associated with intermittent sore throat, blood-tinged sputum, and nasal crusting, without rhinorrhea. Two months after the onset of symptoms, examination by an otolaryngologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary revealed a straight septum, with active bleeding bilaterally. Cauterization with silver nitrate was performed, followed by packing; nasal dryness and intermittent bleeding persisted. Six months after the onset of symptoms, fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examination revealed crusting in the nose, mucosal inflammation, and synechiae in the left nasal cavity, without masses or polyps. Amoxicillin with clavulanate was prescribed. Three months later, surgical repair of bilateral nasal vestibular stenosis, with polymeric-silicone splints, and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens showed superficial fragments of squamous mucosa with mild atypia, hyperkeratosis, a prominent granular layer, and no evidence of cancer. A tapering course of prednisone (starting at 40 mg daily) and topical triamcinolone acetonide cream were administered, with partial improvement. During the next year, symptoms persisted despite multiple fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examinations, d\u00e9bridement of the crusted tissue, the application of topical antibiotic unguent, and nasal rinses. Approximately 20 months after the onset of symptoms, examination revealed complete obstruction of the nasal passages, with scab formation and no polyps or discharge; nasal cultures grew normal flora. Additional d\u00e9bridement was followed by the application of mupirocin ointment. Follow-up cultures grew moderate anaerobes and fewStaphylococcus aureus. A 2-week course of clindamycin was prescribed. Approximately 1 year before this evaluation, painful ulcers developed on the buccal mucosa and tongue. Multiple courses of prednisone (up to 40 mg daily, rapidly tapering over a period of 1 week) were administered, with transient improvement during each course. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and antinuclear antibodies was negative. A chest radiograph and results of computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses were normal. During the next 4 months, episodes of epistaxis increased in frequency, in association with nasal crusting and sinus congestion. Eight months before this evaluation, on evaluation by a rheumatologist at this hospital, the patient reported dyspnea, cough, fatigue, ear fullness, and weight loss of 7 kg. Examination revealed normal vital signs and an ulceration on the tip of the tongue; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of thyroid peroxidase antibody was 291.0 IU per milliliter (reference range, <35.0), and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were positive at 1:40 dilution (reference, negative at 1:10). The complete blood count was normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM); results of tests of renal and liver function and serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Testing for syphilis (with the use of rapid plasma reagin), rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, and ribonuclear protein. Colchicine, 0.6 mg twice daily, was administered for 1 week but was stopped because of diarrhea. The patient began to use dexamethasone elixir mouthwash, with improvement in the oral lesions. CT of the chest revealed a hiatal hernia. Approximately 5 months before this evaluation, intermittent rectal bleeding developed. Colonoscopic examination performed at another hospital reportedly showed two ulcers, 25 cm from the anal verge, without surrounding inflammation. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions showed no evidence of ulceration or vasculitis; there were mild nonspecific findings of focal acute cryptitis and rare lymphoid aggregates. Serologic evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease was reportedly negative except for the presence of IgG antibodies toSaccharomyces cerevisiae(34.9 ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] units per milliliter; reference range, <17.8). Omeprazole, colchicine, and vitamin B were prescribed, without improvement. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain of the oral ulcers at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and reported recurrent epistaxis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, arthralgias, and intermittent pain in the elbows and legs, without swelling, erythema, or increased warmth. She did not have alopecia, uveitis, rash (malar or other), genital ulcers, or anal or perianal fistulas. She had a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines. A transient ischemic attack had occurred 3.5 years before this evaluation, associated with tinnitus in the right ear, numbness and weakness on the left side, and possible aphasia; the symptoms had resolved after several hours. Daily medications included atenolol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, levothyroxine, prednisone (20 mg, tapering from 40 mg over a period of 7 days), simvastatin, and aspirin (81 mg). She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanate, erythromycin, and tetracycline (which had caused rashes), and ciprofloxacin. The patient was married, had two grown children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother and sister had celiac disease, and her sister also had scleroderma. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/91 mm Hg and other vital signs were normal. The weight was 76.2 kg. The oropharynx was pink, with numerous erosions of the mucous membranes of the mouth, including the tongue, soft palate, and inner buccal mucosa, without bleeding (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and level of C-reactive protein were normal.

When the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation. Several months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking. Six days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained. An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation. Cardiac Studies.An electrocardiogram (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, and right ventricular hypertrophy, as evidenced by right axis deviation and an increased R\u2032-wave amplitude in lead V1. Echocardiographic images obtained in a parasternal short-axis view (Panel B) and in an apical four-chamber view with color Doppler (Panel C) both show enlargement of the right ventricle (RV); LV denotes left ventricle. There is also flattening of the interventricular septum during systole, a finding that suggests elevated pressures in the right side of the heart (Panel B). There is moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (Panel C, asterisk); on the basis of the tricuspid regurgitation velocity, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 84 mm Hg. Echocardiographic images obtained in other views (not shown) confirmed the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A frontal chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed enlarged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A frontal chest radiograph (Panel A) shows enlarged hila (arrows). A focal area of coarse calcification is seen over the right upper quadrant (arrowhead). Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the chest (Panels B and C) show enlargement of the right ventricle (Panel B, arrow) and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery and its right (R) and left (L) main branches (Panel C, arrowheads). The calcified mass is partially seen within the hepatic dome (Panel B, arrowhead). The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver. The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school. The patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy. On examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected.

The patient had been well until 21 days before this admission, when myalgias, arthralgias, chills, fever (with a temperature of 39.2\u00b0C), and upper respiratory symptoms occurred. Seven days later, he was seen by his physician because of worsening symptoms. A rapid test for influenza virus was reportedly negative. A diagnosis of possible influenza was made, and supportive care was advised. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed evidence of pneumonia in the left upper lobe. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered intravenously, azithromycin and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home. Two days later, 11 days before this admission, the patient called his physician because of persistent symptoms; prednisone and cough syrup were prescribed. After 2 more days, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of another hospital. He reported exhaustion, fever (with a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C) despite having taken acetaminophen, and cough with blood-tinged sputum and pleuritic chest pain that prevented him from sleeping. On examination, he had dyspnea. The blood pressure was 148/71 mm Hg, the pulse between 88 and 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air at rest. There were crackles at the left lung base and left axillary region. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph revealed a dense infiltrate on the left side. A diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia was made, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin were administered. Laboratory Data. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained 6 days before this admission (Figure 1A and 1B) showed severe consolidation in the left upper lobe, relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, a trace left pleural effusion, and no obvious lymphadenopathy. Subsequent portable anteroposterior chest radiographs that were obtained during the next 5 days (Figure 1C) revealed further opacification of the left lung, with predominant involvement of the upper lobe, and worsening multifocal consolidation in the right lung that was most severe in the right upper lobe. Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained 6 days before this admission (Panels A and B, respectively) show severe consolidation in the left upper lobe, relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, and a trace left pleural effusion. A portable anteroposterior portable chest radiograph that was obtained during the next 5 days with the patient in the supine position (Panel C) shows nearly complete consolidation in the left lung and worsening, multifocal consolidation in the right lung that is most severe in the right upper lobe. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph that was obtained on admission with the patient in the supine position (Panel D) shows placement of endotracheal and esophagogastric tubes, as well as a further increase in bilateral multifocal consolidation, without pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. Vancomycin therapy was initiated on the third day at the other hospital, and imipenem therapy was initiated on the fifth day. On the sixth day (4 days before admission to this hospital), hypoxemia occurred, and an increasing amount of supplemental oxygen was required. The level of \u03b11-antitrypsin was 270 mg per deciliter (reference range, 93 to 209). The anion gap and blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, IgG, and IgM were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU. Bronchoscopic examination revealed purulent secretions, without mucous plugs or masses. Cultures of sputum specimens were negative. Echocardiography revealed normal biventricular function and wall motion, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 to 65%. On the ninth day at the other hospital, bilevel positive airway pressure was administered, with some improvement. Later that day, the trachea was electively intubated and methylprednisolone was administered. Cultures of the sputum grew candida species; blood cultures were negative. On the 10th day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital (according to his family\u2019s wishes) and admitted to the medical ICU. Medications at the time of transfer were fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine by intravenous infusions, as well as vecuronium, imipenem, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, ondansetron, methylprednisolone, sodium succinate, acetaminophen, enoxaparin, albuterol by nebulizer, fluticasone nasal spray, and nystatin suspension. The patient had gout, for which he took indomethacin as needed. He had received an influenza vaccination earlier that season. He had no known allergies. He was married, had adult children, and lived in a semirural area of New England. He worked in manufacturing and had traveled for work to Indonesia and Japan during the month before this admission and to northern New England and the region surrounding the St. Lawrence River basin frequently during the previous year. His coworkers had not been ill. He reportedly did not participate in outdoor sports activities. He had a history of 40 pack-years of smoking and had stopped smoking 6 months before this admission; he drank alcohol infrequently and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and sister had \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, his mother had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and his father had died at 63 years of age from myocardial infarction. On examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 89/22 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute while he was receiving ventilatory support. There were coarse breath sounds bilaterally and diffuse 2+ edema of the arms and legs; the heart sounds and abdomen were normal. The plasma anion gap and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, as were blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, globulin, amylase, lipase, IgG, IgM, C3, and C4; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine, with 1+ albumin and 2+ urobilinogen by dipstick. There were 5 to 10 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, a few squamous cells, very few transitional cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. A chest radiograph that was obtained at the time of admission to this hospital revealed placement of endotracheal and esophagogastric tubes. There was a further increase in severe bilateral multifocal consolidation, without pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion (Figure 1D). The fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 1.00, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) rose to 93 mm Hg, with an oxygen saturation of 95%. Methylprednisolone, meropenem, and continuous infusions of fentanyl, vasopressin, and propofol were administered; imipenem was discontinued. Gram\u2019s staining of a sputum specimen revealed a moderate amount of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no organisms; testing for antigens to adenovirus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses.

67-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with hypoxemia. Six years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated because of melena and anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal ulcers; biopsy of one of the ulcers revealed changes consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a locally invasive mass in the head of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the duodenum was made, and treatment included chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Two months after the surgery, surveillance CT of the chest showed segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended, but the patient declined. During the next 5 years, surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months. Six months before the current presentation, CT of the abdomen showed a new mass in the sigmoid colon with associated nodularity and lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed two fungating, nonobstructing, medium-sized masses, one at the ileocecal valve and the other in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of mantle-cell lymphoma was established. The patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital, and plans were made for treatment with chemotherapy. Five months before the current presentation, pain in the right leg developed after a long car trip. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Nine weeks before the current presentation, cycle 1 of rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) chemotherapy was administered, along with filgrastim. In addition, the administration of acyclovir and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started for prophylaxis; however, rash developed on the trunk after 1 week, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was replaced with atovaquone for prophylaxis againstPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia. Six weeks before the current presentation, cycle 2 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Two days later, melena, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Laboratory testing revealed anemia (hematocrit, 26.8%; normal range, 41.0 to 53.0). The patient received 2 units of packed red cells, and fatigue and dyspnea resolved. Treatment with omeprazole was initiated. Four weeks before the current presentation, the administration of atovaquone was stopped because of the cost of the medication, and dapsone was started for prophylaxis againstP. jiroveciipneumonia. Three weeks before the current presentation, cycle 3 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed resolution of the distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was stopped. Two weeks before the current presentation, fatigue and dyspnea on exertion recurred, but melena did not. Laboratory testing again revealed anemia (hematocrit, 28.7%), and the patient received 1 unit of packed red cells; fatigue resolved, but dyspnea did not. On the day of presentation, the patient was evaluated before the administration of cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy. He reported ongoing dyspnea on exertion but no cough, fever, chills, chest pain, or orthopnea. He had been having loose stools since the pancreaticoduodenectomy. Other medical history included hypertension and hereditary spherocytosis, which had been treated with splenectomy. Medications included acyclovir, dapsone, lisinopril, and omeprazole. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole had caused a rash; there were no other known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol rarely; he had smoked tobacco for 2 years but had quit 20 years before this presentation. He was divorced, lived alone in a suburb of Boston, and worked as a lawyer. His mother had had breast cancer. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 92% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air, 88 to 90% while he was walking and breathing ambient air, and 93% while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. The patient had tachypnea but no increased work of breathing. The lung sounds were normal, and the jugular venous pulse was not elevated. The legs had no edema. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of coagulation, kidney-function, and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was negative, as was a respiratory viral panel. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed filling defects in the right upper lobe and both lower lobes, findings consistent with pulmonary emboli. Subtle tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities were present in the upper lobes. Scattered pulmonary nodules were present bilaterally; they were stable in size as compared with nodules observed on previous imaging studies. The main pulmonary artery measured 2.6 cm in diameter proximal to bifurcation. CT Pulmonary Angiogram Obtained on Presentation.Mild tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities are present in the upper lobes (Panel A, circled), findings that are probably indicative of inflammatory changes. Small filling defects are present in subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the right upper lobe (Panel B, arrow) and both lower lobes (Panel C, arrows), findings that are consistent with pulmonary emboli. The heart (Panel C) and pulmonary artery (Panel D) are normal, with no radiologic evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. Cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was delayed. Treatment with intravenous heparin was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Three weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. Eleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion. Neuroimaging Studies.An initial axial CT image of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel A), shows no acute intracranial abnormality. There was no large infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. The following day, magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed. Axial T2-weighted images show chronic infarcts in the right thalamus (Panel B, arrow) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Panel C, arrow). An axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel D) shows no areas of restricted diffusion that would suggest an acute infarction. Maximum-intensity-projection images were obtained from three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial circulation (Panel E) and gadolinium-enhanced MRA of the neck (Panel F). The images show no high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the major intracranial or cervical arteries. A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus (Figure 1B) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Figure 1C). There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Figure 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Figure 1E and 1F). Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2BandVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg. Echocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.On transthoracic echocardiography (Panel A), a parasternal long-axis view shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets, a finding suggestive of vegetations (arrow). An apical three-chamber view on transthoracic echocardiography (Panel B) again shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets on the atrial surface. A transesophageal echocardiogram (Panel C) shows the vegetations (arrow) on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines. There was associated mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation (not shown). Coronal (Panel D) and sagittal (Panel E) CT images of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show an enlarged heterogeneous uterus (Panel E, arrow). An axial CT image of the pelvis (Panel F) shows calcified uterine masses (arrows) that were consistent with fibroids. LA denotes left atrium, LV left ventricle, and MV mitral valve. On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2CandVideos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously. On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained. Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies. The patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex.

The patient had been well until 3 weeks before presentation to this hospital, when sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and chills developed. He noted areas of crusting and occasional bleeding in both nares (Figure 1). His brother had reportedly received a recent diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinical Photograph of the Nares.Three weeks before the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital, areas of crusting developed around both nares. Two weeks before presentation to this hospital, the patient had traveled by airplane to the northwestern United States for a wilderness backpacking trip. Shortly after he arrived, cramping pain developed in his left calf. Over the next 2 days, the pain worsened in severity and was associated with swelling of the calf. He presented to another clinic for evaluation. Noninvasive ultrasonography of the lower leg was performed, and the results were reportedly normal. Ibuprofen was recommended for pain control, and azithromycin was prescribed for suspected upper respiratory infection. Despite the administration of ibuprofen, the pain in the left calf worsened and limited the patient\u2019s ability to bear weight. The swelling progressed from the calf to the foot, and an erythematous rash developed on the dorsum of both feet. One week before presentation to this hospital, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease, which had been diagnosed when he was 10 years of age and had resulted in prolonged glucocorticoid use. During the previous 3 years, weekly treatment with adalimumab led to clinical improvement in his Crohn\u2019s disease and he had a considerable growth spurt, in which he gained several inches in height. During the previous several years, the patient had had multiple self-limited episodes of sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal crusting with associated bleeding. He occasionally used ibuprofen at home but took no other over-the-counter or herbal medications. He was a college student and resided in the central United States. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He had a sibling with Crohn\u2019s disease. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He did not appear ill but was in mild distress because of the pain in the left lower leg. The nasal crusting and the swelling of nasal mucous membranes had markedly improved during the previous 2 weeks. The nasal septum was intact, and no nasal polyps or blood were present. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was tenderness on palpation and swelling in the left lower leg from the calf to the dorsal aspect of the foot, without erythema, warmth, or pitting (Figure 2A). Synovitis of the left ankle was present. Peripheral pulses were normal. Nontender purpuric lesions, including some that were faintly palpable, were present on both lower legs but were more numerous on the left leg (Figure 2B). Two tender nodules (each 1 cm in diameter) with overlying erythema were present above the right medial malleolus (Figure 2C) and were similar to lesions the patient had had transiently in the past. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, creatine kinase, C3, and C4 were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests, the complete blood count, and the differential count. Assays for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were negative. Tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis C virus antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Blood cultures showed no growth. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.014 and a pH of 5.5 and with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, protein, blood, or nitrates by dipstick; examination of the sediment revealed no red cells, white cells, bacteria, or casts. The blood C-reactive protein level was 2.0 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 0.9), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, <10), and an antistreptolysin O titer 400 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 200). Clinical Photographs of the Lower Legs.On the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital, tenderness and swelling of left lower leg were present from the calf to the dorsal aspect of the foot (Panel A). Nontender, palpable purpuric lesions were present on both lower legs but were more numerous on the left lower leg and foot (Panel B). Two tender nodules (each 1 cm in diameter) with overlying erythema were present above the right medial malleolus (Panel C). Radiography of the chest revealed a normal cardiac silhouette and no consolidations or pleural effusions. Computed tomography of the tibia, fibula, and foot, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal osseous structures without fractures or cortical erosions, as well as diffuse nonspecific edema of the soft tissues of the ankle and proximal dorsal foot without abscesses or deep fascial thickening. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.

On the day of admission, the patient\u2019s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and \u201cmental slowness\u201d of 2 weeks\u2019 duration. A review of systems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had immigrated to the United States two decades earlier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 160/80 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and oriented. She was unable to perform simple calculations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small nontender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, periaortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyperintensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, without corresponding restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement (Figure 1). The findings were unchanged from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation. MRI of the Head.Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images at the level of the centrum semiovale (Panel A) and at the level of the corona radiata (Panel B) show multifocal patchy hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter bilaterally (arrows). Axial T1-weighted images (Panels C and D) and axial diffusion-weighted images (Panels E and F), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, show no enhancement or restricted diffusion corresponding to the white-matter hyperintensities detected on the FLAIR images. Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclovir was stopped.

On the day of admission, the patient was found by emergency medical services personnel, who had been contacted by a neighbor. He was sitting on a mattress, was incontinent of feces and urine, and was surrounded by empty prescription containers for gabapentin and bupropion, along with empty bottles of vodka. He had last been seen by neighbors 4 days earlier, when he reportedly locked himself in his apartment after purchasing alcohol. No other drugs or drug paraphernalia were found. On examination, he was conscious and shaking and did not speak or follow commands. The initial score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 10 (on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness). The blood pressure was 236/158 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The lungs were clear. Glucometer readings of fingerstick capillary blood specimens reported an error. He required assistance to stand and walk to the stretcher. He was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 216/100 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but unable to give his name, answer questions, or follow commands. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 11 (4 for spontaneous eye opening, 2 for incomprehensible sounds, and 5 for response to pain). The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. No papilledema was present. He was able to track and regard the examiner. The face was symmetric. Cough and gag reflex were present. He moved his limbs spontaneously and against gravity. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, plantar reflexes were flexor bilaterally, and there was no Hoffman\u2019s reflex (a relatively nonspecific sign in which tapping of the nail or flicking of the terminal phalanx of the middle or ring finger leads to flexion of the terminal phalanx of the thumb that can herald upper motor neuron disease). A few beats of ankle clonus were present. The skin was cool and slightly pale, and the remainder of the examination was normal, with no evidence of head trauma or other injury. An electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, lactic acid, troponin T, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide; other test results are shown inTable 1. Toxicologic screening of blood and urine was negative. Cultures of blood and urine were obtained. Lactulose was administered through a nasogastric tube, and intravenous normal saline and haloperidol were administered. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material approximately 2.5 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, revealed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular hypodensity, findings suggestive of hydrocephalus related to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. There was also a heterogeneous, partially hyperdense intraventricular lesion involving the ependyma, with a focus in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle measuring approximately 2 cm (Figure 1A) and other components involving the third ventricle. There was no intracranial hemorrhage or large infarction. Imaging Studies.Approximately 2.5 hours after presentation, a CT scan of the head was obtained without the administration of contrast material (Panel A). It shows marked ventriculomegaly and periventricular hypodensity, findings suggestive of acute hydrocephalus. In addition, it shows a heterogeneous lesion, a portion of which is visible in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle (Panel A, arrow) and appears to involve the ependymal lining of the ventricle. Approximately 5 hours after presentation, MRI scans of the head were obtained. Axial T1-weighted images that were obtained before and after the administration of contrast material (Panels B and C, respectively) and a contrast-enhanced coronal image (Panel D) show marked, diffuse enlargement of the lateral ventricles. An enhancing lesion is present that involves the ependyma in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle; it has a nodular component (Panels B and C, arrows), as well as smooth enhancement extending into the third ventricle (Panel D, arrowhead). An axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel E) shows the intrinsic T2hyperintensity of the nodular lesion in the left lateral ventricle (arrow), as well as diffuse periventricular T2hyperintensity, a finding that most likely reflects transependymal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid that results from acute hydrocephalus. An apparent diffusion coefficient image (Panel F) shows peripherally restricted diffusion in the nodular lesion (arrow). Approximately 5 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B through 1F). T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed marked enlargement of the lateral ventricles and prominent periventricular hyperintensity that reflected transependymal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a feature consistent with acute hydrocephalus. T1-weighted images revealed enhancing lesions involving the ependyma of the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle that extended toward the foramen of Monro. A smooth and nodular enhancing lesion extended into and partially filled the third ventricle. There was mildly restricted diffusion in the enhancing lesion, including the nodular component in the left lateral ventricle. Given the heterogeneous enhancement, some of which had corresponding restricted diffusion, infection and cancer were the principal diagnostic considerations. A right transfrontal external ventricular drain was placed while the patient was in the trauma bay. The opening pressure was 24 mm Hg (normal value, \u226411). Results of CSF analysis are shown inTable 1. Bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained, and vancomycin was administered. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU). During the next 3 days, one of two sets of blood cultures in aerobic bottles grew gram-positive cocci, which were identified asStaphylococcus saprophyticus,Aerococcus viridans,and probableS. sciuri; repeat cultures were negative, as were cultures of the urine and CSF. Examination of sputum specimens revealed squamous cells and mixed bacteria, with no evidence of acid-fast bacilli. Blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, insulin-like growth factor 1, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, and testing for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, cryptococcal antigens, and IgG antibodies to echinococcus andTaenia solium(which causes cysticercosis) were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Cefepime, folate, thiamine, and cyanocobalamin were administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver and borderline splenomegaly. A feeding tube was inserted. A tuberculin skin test was negative. An electroencephalogram showed frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity and frequent irregular left hemispheric delta slowing amid diffuse delta\u2013theta background slowing, without evidence of overt electrographic or clinical seizure activity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%, mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, and no evidence of valvular vegetations. The patient remained afebrile. The transduced intracranial pressure ranged from 7 to 15 mm Hg. On examination, the patient opened his eyes to voice, had dysconjugate gaze, and did not track or follow commands. The pupils were equal and reactive, and he blinked in response to threat. He withdrew his arms and legs from pain and had antigravity strength. The reflexes were symmetric, and plantar reflexes were flexor. A family member was identified and contacted. The next day, patient data from another clinic revealed a history of chronic lower back pain and hepatitis C virus infection, and the patient had had a possible retinal abnormality 1 year earlier. There was no known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or diabetes mellitus. His medications were gabapentin and bupropion. He was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone, had been incarcerated in the past, and had few friends. He smoked cigarettes, drank 1 liter of hard alcohol daily, and reportedly did not use illicit drugs. His mother had died of hypertension and kidney disease, a brother had reportedly died after a stroke while withdrawing from alcohol, and his father had hypertension.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 weeks before this admission, when he was on vacation in the Caribbean and his wife noted that he was unresponsive, \u201cgurgling,\u201d and diaphoretic in the early morning. When he awoke, he reported chest pain, palpitations, and light-headedness. The patient was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where the heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The troponin T level was 1.56 ng per milliliter (normal range, <0.01), and the lactate level was 1.9 mmol per liter (17 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 1.6 mmol per liter [5 to 14 mg per deciliter]). A complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, and amylase were normal, as were results of tests of renal and thyroid function; ad-dimer level was undetectable. While the patient was in the local hospital, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia developed at a heart rate of 201 beats per minute; electrocardioversion resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm. Aspirin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, and tirofiban were administered. The patient was transferred by air to a hospital in Florida. On examination at the second hospital, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 57 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood troponin I level was 116.00 ng per milliliter (normal range, \u22640.05). A complete blood count, results of renal-function tests, levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin, and the prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) showed sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and delayed intraventricular conduction. Aspirin, amiodarone, enoxaparin, and atorvastatin were administered. Ventricular tachycardia recurred at a heart rate of 176 beats per minute. Despite the administration of an intravenous bolus of amiodarone, ventricular tachycardia persisted. Electrocardioversion restored sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and cardiac studies were performed. Initial Cardiac Studies, Obtained at the Second Hospital.Cardiac studies were obtained during the patient\u2019s initial hospitalization in Florida. An electrocardiogram (Panel A) shows sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, borderline first-degree atrioventricular delay, delayed intraventricular conduction, and a normal frontal-plane QRS axis. A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained in a parasternal long-axis view (Panel B) shows mildly increased thickness of the interventricular septum (measuring 13 mm) and a mildly dilated left ventricle (measuring 60 mm at end diastole). Cardiac MRI was also performed. A fat-suppressed, T2-weighted image obtained in a short-axis view (Panel C) shows a hyperintense septum (arrows), a finding consistent with myocardial edema. An image with late gadolinium enhancement, obtained in a short-axis view (Panel D), shows patchy enhancement in the septum at the subepicardial location, with extension into the subendocardial layer of the midanterior segment; subepicardial gadolinium enhancement is also seen in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (arrows). An image with late gadolinium enhancement, obtained in a four-chamber view (Panel E), shows nodular foci in the midwall of the septum, as well as subepicardial gadolinium enhancement in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (arrows). Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. On ventriculography, the left ventricle was mildly and diffusely hypokinetic, and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg (normal range, 8 to 15). Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B) revealed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 60 mm (normal range, 42 to 58) and an ejection fraction of 35% (normal range, 55 to 70); there was diffuse hypokinesis that was most notable in the inferior and septal territories, mildly increased wall thickness, and mild mitral regurgitation (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the septal hypokinesis and revealed moderate left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 43%, as well as mild right ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 36% (seeVideos 2 and 3, available at NEJM.org). The left ventricular myocardium was normal in thickness. T2-weighted images (Figure 1C) showed marked myocardial edema that was most prominent in the interventricular septum. The ratio of signal in the myocardium to signal in the skeletal muscle was elevated, at 2.4 (normal range, \u22641.9), a finding compatible with edema. Images with late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1D and 1E) showed patchy, nodular foci in the midwall and subepicardium of the septum and in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle, with minimal extension into the subendocardium of the anterior segment at the midventricular level. The myocardial edema and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement fulfilled the Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.1,2 Additional laboratory test results included negative nucleic acid amplification tests of the blood for DNA of adenovirus,Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, andMycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as negative nucleic acid amplification tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for DNA ofBordetella pertussis, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. In addition, serologic testing was negative for antibodies to coxsackievirus, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, Lyme disease, andTrypanosoma cruzi, as well as for IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus viral capsid antigen, and parvovirus. Aspirin, metoprolol succinate, and amiodarone were prescribed, and the patient was discharged with a wearable defibrillator vest after a follow-up visit had been scheduled at this hospital. Ten days before this admission, the patient had consultations at this hospital with a cardiologist specializing in the management of heart failure and an electrophysiologist. Vital signs were notable for a heart rate of 49 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 108/70 mm Hg; the examination was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed sinus bradycardia and first-degree atrioventricular delay, as well as right bundle-branch block and a left anterior fascicular block (which together constitute bifascicular block). Aspirin was stopped, spironolactone was added, and placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was scheduled. Subsequent Cardiac Studies, Obtained at This Hospital.An electrocardiogram obtained during the patient\u2019s visit to an outpatient clinic at this hospital, 10 days before admission (Panel A), shows sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and progression to right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block (which together constitute bifascicular block). A follow-up electrocardiogram obtained shortly after implantation of the implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) at this hospital (Panel B) shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with an extremely wide QRS complex. A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained in a parasternal long-axis view shortly after the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit of this hospital (Panel C) shows thinning of the interventricular septum (arrow), which had decreased in thickness from 13 mm to 7 mm during the 4-week period since the initial echocardiogram had been obtained. On the morning of this admission, during placement of a dual-chamber ICD, episodes of ventricular tachycardia with varying foci were induced. These episodes were terminated with overdrive pacing. After the procedure, ventricular tachycardia developed, with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute (Figure 2B). The blood pressure was 88/53 mm Hg, and a lidocaine infusion was administered. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. During the next 10 hours, multiple additional episodes of monomorphic ventricular rhythms occurred, with the heart rate ranging from 90 to 140 beats per minute. The rate of lidocaine infusion was increased, and amiodarone was administered. Early in the morning of the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia recurred, with associated dyspnea and a blood pressure of 66/40 mm Hg. Normal saline and norepinephrine were administered intravenously. Chest radiography revealed ICD leads in the appropriate position, and bedside echocardiography revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion.

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before the current admission, when a headache and sore throat developed, without a fever. On evaluation at her physician\u2019s office, a rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and she returned home. During the next 2 days, throat pain persisted and oral intake decreased. She was admitted to the observation unit of another hospital because of dehydration, weakness, and fevers, with a temperature as high as 39.4\u00b0C. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient reportedly had a white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter, positive tests for IgG and IgM antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific viral capsid antigen and antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen, and negative tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza A and B viruses, and IgM and IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). A pharyngeal culture grew group C streptococcus. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis with possible bacterial superinfection was made. Intravenous fluids were administered, and her condition improved. On day 2, treatment with erythromycin was begun and she was discharged home. Nine days before the current admission, trismus, pain on opening the mouth, and swelling on the right side of the face and jaw developed. The patient returned to the emergency department of the same hospital; parotitis was diagnosed, and ibuprofen was administered. Pain persisted on the right side of the jaw and was associated with temperatures as high as 38.3\u00b0C and swelling and erythema of the right parotid gland and face. Six days before the current admission, the patient was seen at a second hospital; prednisone and narcotic analgesic agents were administered, and massage of the parotid gland was performed. She returned home. Fevers persisted, and edema of the right lateral side of the face and neck worsened. Three days later, she was seen by her physician and was admitted to the second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck reportedly revealed no evidence of retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscesses. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. Two days before the current admission, swelling of the right eyelids and horizontal diplopia developed. On evaluation, there was decreased abduction of the right eye. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed a multiloculated, rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right parotid gland and inflammation of the masticator space. There was linear enhancement of the pachymeninges in the right temporal region, a finding that raised concern about meningitis. Diffusion-weighted images obtained at the level of the parotid gland showed findings consistent with an abscess. There was an irregularity of the right cavernous sinus, without definite thrombosis. A subperiosteal abscess in the right orbit was also identified. The patient was transferred to a third hospital. On examination, she was alert and communicative. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse swelling of the right preauricular and periorbital areas, mild trismus, bilateral cervical submental and submandibular lymphadenopathy (greater on the right side than on the left), and preauricular and postauricular lymphadenopathy on the right side. White plaque was seen on the gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior tongue, which was painful when scraped. The right Stensen\u2019s duct was tender on firm compression, with no fluid discharge. On neurologic examination, the right eye had medial deviation, with an inability to abduct past the midline. The patient had mild difficulty with tandem walking. The general and neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, magnesium, globulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and IgG, IgA, and IgM. Tests for heterophile antibodies, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, and HIV nucleic acid were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace protein, 3+ glucose, and 2+ urobilinogen, along with squamous epithelial cells and bacteria, findings suggestive of contamination. Laboratory Data. MRI of the head, orbits, face, and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1), reportedly revealed changes consistent with multiple lobulated abscesses in the right parotid gland, with extensive inflammation surrounding the gland that involved the muscles of mastication, as well as a small subperiosteal abscess along the right lateral orbital wall, dural enhancement along the right temporal lobe, and enhancement along the cavernous sinus; these findings were again not thought to constitute definite evidence of thrombosis. Changes consistent with extensive periodontal disease were also seen. Vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin were administered. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of fluid collected in the parotid gland was performed, and the aspirate was cultured. The following day, CT of the sinuses, performed with the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed preseptal swelling of the right eye extending to the temporal fossa, subperiosteal enhancement adjacent to the right lateral rectus muscle, and heterogeneous enhancement and enlargement of the right parotid gland; there was no substantial improvement in the appearance of the orbital or parotid abnormalities as compared with the previous imaging studies. MRI Scans of the Head and Neck.T1-weighted images of the head and neck were obtained after the administration of contrast material. A coronal image of the head shows temporal pachymeningeal enhancement and subtle leptomeningeal enhancement, findings suggestive of basilar and temporal meningitis (Panel A, arrows). A coronal fat-saturated image (Panel B) and an axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel C) show changes consistent with abscess formation in the right parotid gland (arrows). Axial and coronal fat-saturated images (Panels D and E, respectively) show changes consistent with a subperiosteal abscess in the right orbit (arrows). The patient was transferred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, meropenem, clindamycin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and enoxaparin, as well as an albuterol inhaler, lorazepam, oxycodone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, as needed. She reported having fatigue and double vision, without headache, pain in her eye or throat, or pain with eye movements. She had a history of dysmenorrhea, for which she took norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, and asthma. She was allergic to penicillins, which had caused urticaria, and was possibly allergic to cephalosporins. She lived with her family and attended high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and she had had no travel-related exposures. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable. The vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air. The right parotid gland, face, and neck were swollen, with marked periorbital edema of the right eyelid, minimal erythema and tenderness, and no palpable fluctuance; the right eye had 1+ lateral clear chemosis (Figure 2). The right parotid gland was tender. There was a whitish plaque on the inner aspect of the right buccal mucosa, which was tender and had no obvious abscesses. The patient was able to swallow oral secretions. A systolic murmur, grade 1 out of 6, was heard at the left lower sternal border. There was bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, greater on the right side than on the left. On neurologic examination, visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. In the right eye, supraduction was limited by 50%, abduction was slightly limited, and infraduction and adduction were normal; the left eye had normal motility, with splinting on upgaze. Other cranial-nerve functions (excluding smell, which was not tested) and the remainder of the general and neurologic examinations were normal.

The patient had been born at another hospital by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks 3 days of gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by maternal obesity. The patient was placed with an adoptive family immediately after birth. Her birth mother had received prenatal care, and screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; a screening test for immunity to rubella virus was positive, as was a screening test for group B streptococcal colonization. Spontaneous rupture of membranes, which occurred 2 hours before birth, revealed meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and five doses of penicillin were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.9 kg (87th percentile), the length 51.5 cm (80th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (85th percentile); the vital signs and physical examination were normal. A diet of organic cow\u2019s milk\u2013based infant formula with a probiotic was begun shortly after birth; the patient drank the formula avidly, and urine and stool output were normal for her age. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests (i.e., a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism) and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congenital heart disease were normal, and the patient received intramuscular vitamin K, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and a hepatitis B immunization before discharge. Five days before this admission, at a routine pediatric examination, the patient\u2019s adoptive parents reported that she had been drinking 60 ml of formula every 3 to 4 hours, with some \u201cspit ups,\u201d and that she produced four yellow-brown stools each day. She appeared well, with mild jaundice, and was scheduled to return 10 days later for another routine appointment. One day before this admission, nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred after each feed. The baby was fussier and less active than usual and drank only 30 to 45 ml of formula per feed before falling asleep, as compared with the 90 to 105 ml per feed she had had the previous day. Her father called the pediatrician during the evening and was advised to take the baby to the emergency department at another hospital. On presentation to the other hospital, the patient was alert and responded appropriately to physical examination. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 85/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.5 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken; the remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus were negative. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed orange urine, with a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity higher than 1.030, 3+ protein, and 2+ bilirubin. A chest radiograph was normal. Multiple attempts to place an intravenous catheter were unsuccessful; ampicillin and ceftriaxone were administered intramuscularly, and an enteral electrolyte solution was administered through a nasogastric tube and did not cause vomiting. Early during the following day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) at this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Laboratory Data. The patient had lived with her adoptive family in an urban area of New England since birth. Her biologic half-brother had autism and eczema and had undergone placement of tympanostomy tubes. The patient had no known exposure to sick persons. On admission to this hospital, the results of physical examination were unchanged. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 10% dextrose in water with 0.225% normal saline. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 84 mg per deciliter (4.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 60 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.3 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). Ampicillin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was fed a cow\u2019s milk\u2013based formula, and vomiting recurred. Enteral feeding was stopped, the administration of intravenous fluid was continued, and vomiting ceased. The next day, the physical examination was normal. The results of an acylcarnitine profile analysis were normal, as were the results of blood amino acid analysis, with the exception of an alanine level of 582 nmol per milliliter (reference range, 139 to 474). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.008, and 1+ glucose. An electrocardiogram was normal. An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux; there was no evidence of intestinal malrotation. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed mild pyelectasis in the left kidney and was otherwise normal; limited abdominal ultrasonography revealed no evidence of pyloric stenosis. The cultures of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid that had been performed at the other hospital remained negative, and ampicillin and cefepime were discontinued. Oral administration of an electrolyte solution was begun and did not cause vomiting. On the third hospital day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric unit. Her home diet of an organic cow\u2019s milk\u2013based formula with a probiotic was resumed. Overnight, she vomited once, approximately 2 hours after a feed. Vomiting after feeds continued during the next day. A diet of an oral electrolyte solution was resumed, and vomiting ceased. On the fifth hospital day, oral administration of an amino acid\u2013based formula was begun and did not cause vomiting. The results of repeat newborn blood-spot screening tests were reported as normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Over the next 2 days, the patient continued to receive the amino acid\u2013based formula without vomiting; the administration of intravenous fluid was stopped. Laboratory test results obtained on the sixth and seventh hospital days are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day, at which time the weight was 3.4 kg. Three days after discharge, the patient was seen for follow-up by her pediatrician. Her parents reported that she had had five episodes of spitting up during the previous 24 hours, that she had appeared tired and pale, and that her oral intake had decreased, such that she had consumed only 5 to 25 ml of the amino acid\u2013based formula per feed that day. She was also producing frequent loose, small-volume, greenish stools (10 in a 24-hour period); during the bowel movements, borborygmi were audible and the patient arched her back. On examination, the patient appeared pale and sleepy but aroused during the examination. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 132 beats per minute, and the weight 3.0 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken, the lips were dry, skin turgor was decreased, and the capillary refill time was between 2 and 3 seconds. The patient vomited once in the clinic. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter). The patient was fed an oral electrolyte solution and then was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and her skin appeared ashen; she cried weakly and without tears. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 73/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 58 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Samples of blood and stool were obtained for culture. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.030, and 2+ protein by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU. A bolus of normal saline was administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 5% dextrose with sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. The patient received an oral electrolyte solution without vomiting. The next day, a central venous catheter was placed; abdominal radiography, which was performed to assess its position, revealed an abnormal bowel-gas pattern with narrowing of the lumen and separation of the bowel loops, findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening or ascites (Figure 1A). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed fluid-filled bowel loops with thickened walls (measuring up to 3 mm in thickness), as well as a small amount of associated free intraperitoneal fluid in the right half of the abdomen (Figure 1B and 1C). Imaging Studies.An abdominal radiograph (Panel A) shows narrowing of the lumen and separation of bowel loops in the right half of the abdomen (arrows), findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening. The bowel-gas pattern is nonobstructive, and air is seen in the distal colon. Abdominal ultrasound images obtained in a longitudinal view through the right lower quadrant (Panels B and C) show multiple loops of small bowel in cross section with areas of mural thickening (Panels B and C, black arrowheads) and areas of normal-appearing bowel wall (Panel C, arrows). Moderate ascites is also noted (Panels B and C, white arrowheads).", "true_dx": "Food protein\u2013induced enterocolitis syndrome.", "pred_dx": "Necrotizing enterocolitis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "<|im_start|>assistant", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's tackle this case.", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The patient is a 9-day-old girl with nonbilious vomiting, acidosis, and azotemia.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Starting with the basics, nonbilious vomiting in a newborn can have several causes.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The first thing that comes to mind is gastrointestinal issues like pyloric stenosis, but that usually presents later, around 3-6 weeks, and the ultrasound didn't show that.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Also, the vomiting here started earlier.", "t": 2, "c": "3", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The presence of acidosis and azotemia is significant.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Azotemia refers to elevated BUN and creatinine, which can be due to dehydration, but in a newborn, especially with vomiting, that's a common cause.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "However, the acidosis might be metabolic.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's think about possible metabolic causes.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The lab results mentioned an elevated alanine level, which is a bit unusual.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "High alanine can be seen in some inborn errors of metabolism, like maple syrup urine disease, but that usually presents with specific urine odor and other amino acid abnormalities.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The acylcarnitine profile was normal, so maybe not that.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Wait, the amino acid analysis showed an elevated alanine.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm.", "t": 0, "c": "2", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Also, the urinalysis showed protein and bilirubin initially, but later protein again.", "t": 2, "c": "12", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The imaging showed bowel wall thickening and ascites.", "t": 1, "c": "17", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That makes me think of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is more common in preterm infants, but can occur in term babies, especially with some risk factors.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The baby was full-term, though.", "t": 5, "c": "6", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Risk factors for NEC include formula feeding, especially with cow's milk-based formula, which this baby was on.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Also, there was meconium-stained fluid and antibiotics given prenatally (penicillin), which might disrupt gut flora.", "t": 5, "c": "10", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "NEC typically presents with abdominal distension, bloody stools, and metabolic acidosis.", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The baby here had vomiting, acidosis, azotemia (from decreased perfusion?), and the imaging findings of bowel wall thickening and ascites fit with NEC.", "t": 5, "c": "5", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The fact that the amino acid-based formula helped temporarily but then symptoms recurred when they went back to cow's milk formula might support that the formula was contributing.", "t": 5, "c": "16", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Another thought: Hirschsprung disease?

The patient was born in China. At 7 months of age, she underwent emergency tracheostomy after a caustic injury from either ingestion or inhalation. At 2.5 years of age, she was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States. Her adoptive parents noted that she had stridor and snoring, and her pediatrician referred her to an otolaryngologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) at 2 years 10 months of age. On examination, the nasopharynx was completely obstructed; there was fusion of the posterior tongue and hard palate and of the hard palate and epiglottis, with a narrow opening in the oropharynx. The supraglottic passage was normal beyond the stenosis; the subglottic airway was not evaluated. A tracheostomy was performed, and the left nasal choanal obstruction was opened with a laser. Repeat bronchoscopy revealed that the larynx and subglottic trachea were normal. On two occasions, esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The tracheostomy tube was removed when the patient was 5.5 years of age; there was a residual tracheal\u2013cutaneous fistula. When she was 7.5 years of age (7 months before this admission), another tracheostomy was performed because of worsening oropharyngeal stenosis that precluded intubation and because of concern about possible obstruction. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 6.5 weeks before this admission; during a 10-day period, her mother noted recurrent blood-tinged sputum in the tracheostomy tube, and an episode of bleeding at the tracheostomy site occurred at school. The patient was seen in the emergency department of the MEEI, where a flexible tracheoscopy, which was performed at the bedside after removal of the tracheostomy tube, revealed no exposed blood vessels or granulation tissue in the trachea or stoma. A chest radiograph showed consolidation in the right lower lobe, which was thought to be due to aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis. Gram\u2019s staining of the sputum showed abundant neutrophils, abundant gram-positive cocci in pairs and a few chains, abundant gram-negative diplococci, a few gram-positive rods, and a few thin gram-negative rods. Culture of the sputum from the tracheostomy tube grew methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus,Moraxella catarrhalis,Haemophilus influenzae, andStreptococcus pneumoniae. The patient remained afebrile, and no antibiotic agents were administered. She was admitted overnight for observation and discharged home the next day (5 weeks before this admission). She had one more episode of blood-tinged sputum thereafter. During the 2 weeks before this admission, the oxygen saturation, which was obtained during continuous overnight monitoring for sleep apnea, fell to approximately 85% (from the usual level of approximately 95%) for prolonged periods. Examination at school revealed decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. One day before this admission, while the patient was being bathed, her mother noticed that her chest was asymmetric, with the right nipple appearing lower than the left, and that blood vessels were prominent on the right side of the chest. At the pediatrician\u2019s office the next day, the patient described a recent episode of discomfort in her chest that occurred while she was being hugged. There was no history of respiratory distress, fevers, or cough. On examination, she was tearful and hesitant. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, and a tracheostomy tube was in place. The right lateral chest wall was more prominent than the left, had no crepitus, and was tender to touch. Breath sounds were normal on the left side and diminished on the right. The right upper quadrant of the abdomen was diffusely tender, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred to another hospital for chest radiography, which revealed a large pleural effusion on the right side, with underlying pneumonia. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had sleep apnea and a history of dental caries that necessitated the extraction of several deciduous teeth between 5 and 7 years of age. Immunizations, including the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), were current; she had reportedly received the bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine at 1 month of age. A purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was negative on her arrival in the United States. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived at home with her adoptive parents and siblings; she was physically active, did well in school, and was able to breathe, speak, and eat normally, with the tracheostomy tube capped while she was awake. She lived with two dogs and a cat, and the mother smoked outside the home; she had not recently traveled or had contact with ill persons. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/68 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx was clear, without erythema or focal lesions. The neck was supple, and the tracheostomy site was clean and dry, with an underlying small cavity. Lymphadenopathy (with nodes measuring up to 1 cm in diameter) in the right anterior cervical chain and a mildly tender right axillary lymph node (approximately 1 cm in diameter) were present. There were decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. There was a bulging area (4 cm by 7 cm) on the right lateral chest wall, which was tender on palpation and had no fluctuance or overlying skin changes. The hematocrit, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, magnesium, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, and lactic dehydrogenase and results of renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. A frontal chest radiograph that had been obtained 7 months before this admission showed a tracheostomy tube, clear lungs, and no pleural effusion. Frontal, lateral, and bilateral decubitus chest radiographs that were obtained on the day of admission (Figure 1) showed dense air-space opacification in the right lower lung zone, obscuring the right hemidiaphragm and right cardiac border, as well as a large pleural effusion on the right side that tracked along the lateral chest wall, with evidence of loculation. The left lung and pleural space were clear. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed on the same day after the administration of contrast material (Figure 2), revealed asymmetry of the chest wall that was due to multiple heterogeneous soft-tissue masses and thickening of the soft tissue of the right chest wall. Consolidation was present in the right lower lobe and portions of the right middle lobe. Areas of low attenuation in the right lower lobe were suggestive of decreased perfusion and possible necrosis. A large loculated pleural effusion, irregularly shaped parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe, prominent enhancing ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, and subtle periosteal elevation of the medial aspect of the right eighth rib were also present. Chest Radiographs.Radiographs of the chest were obtained on admission. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) show air-space opacification in the right lower lung zone (asterisks) and a large right pleural effusion (arrows). Decubitus chest radiographs (Panel C [right side down] and Panel D [left side down]) show that pleural fluid on the right side is not freely layering (arrows). CT Scans of the Chest.CT scans of the chest were obtained on admission, after the intravenous administration of contrast material. Panel A shows asymmetry of the chest wall, thickening of the soft tissue of the right chest wall (arrowheads), and multiple heterogeneous soft-tissue masses (arrows). Panels B and C show irregularly shaped parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe (arrows). Panel D shows consolidation in the right lower lobe (arrow) and portions of the right middle lobe, areas of low attenuation in the right lower lobe that suggest decreased perfusion and possible necrosis (arrowheads), and a large loculated pleural effusion (asterisks). Panel E also shows the large loculated pleural effusion (asterisks), as well as a prominent enhancing axillary lymph node (arrow). Panel F shows subtle periosteal elevation of the medial aspect of the right eighth rib (arrow). The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The temperature rose to 38.7\u00b0C, and acetaminophen was administered, with improvement.

The patient had been in good health until 2 weeks before admission, when fatigue developed. Eleven days before presentation, he had moved to the United States from Indonesia. After his arrival, he had bloating and nonbloody, loose bowel movements, without fever, chills, vomiting, cramping, or abdominal pain. One week later, the diarrhea persisted and his exercise tolerance sharply decreased. The day before admission, he was seen at his local health center. Testing included a complete blood count (Table 1) and stool examination. He was referred to this hospital for admission. Laboratory Data. The patient reported weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg in recent weeks, without dyspnea, night sweats, fevers, chills, rash, arthritis, cough, pruritus, alcohol intolerance, or hypersensitivity to insect bites. Two years earlier, the patient had presented with intermittent diarrhea, abdominal cramping, tenesmus, nausea, and weight loss (9 kg); there had been microscopic blood in the stool, and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis had been confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Symptoms had responded to treatment with mesalamine. Complete blood counts at the time of the diagnosis and 7 months before this admission had been normal. On his admission to this hospital, the patient's medications included mesalamine (1.2 g daily) and acetaminophen as needed for headache. He had no known allergies. He was born in India and had lived in Indonesia and Australia during the previous 25 years. He had traveled to a rural area in India in the previous month. He was married, reported being monogamous with his wife, and had no children. He had moved to the United States to attend graduate school. He was a vegetarian, drank alcohol infrequently, had a remote history of light smoking, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents and brother were healthy. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. On examination of the patient, the vital signs were normal. The spleen tip was palpable, and an erythematous papular rash was seen on the anterior thorax; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of creatinine, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, fibrinogen, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, and tryptase were normal, as were the activated partial-thromboplastin time and results of D-dimer testing; testing for total antibodies to hepatitis A virus was positive; and testing for hepatitis A virus IgM, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, as large as 1.4 cm by 2.2 cm by 3.1 cm. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, was normal. Four days later, positron-emission tomography with the use of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) revealed intense uptake of FDG throughout the skeleton and in an enlarged spleen, with low-to-moderate uptake in retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A CT-guided core biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was performed, and the specimen showed reactive hyperplasia with increased eosinophils and plasma cells but no evidence of lymphoma on morphologic studies or flow cytometry. Stool specimens were negative forClostridium difficiletoxin, protozoa, helminth ova, and enteric pathogens.

The patient was born by vaginal delivery to a primigravida mother at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of intrauterine growth retardation. The birth weight was 2.3 kg (first percentile), and Apgar scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The umbilical cord was two-vessel. The patient was admitted to the neonatal ICU. Perinatal examination reportedly revealed natal teeth, retrognathia, and global hypotonia. Laboratory testing showed hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia, which resolved. Jaundice was present; a Coombs\u2019 test was negative, and the patient was treated with phototherapy. No weight gain was noted during her hospitalization. She was discharged from the ICU on the 10th hospital day. At 30 days of life, the patient was seen in the outpatient genetics clinic of the other hospital. On examination, she was reportedly in respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation between 70 and 79% while she was breathing ambient air, and she was transferred to the ICU. A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed borderline cardiomegaly, nonspecific diffuse pulmonary abnormalities, and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma that was reminiscent of chronic lung disease of prematurity. However, since the baby was not born prematurely and was not receiving ventilatory support as a neonate but was small for gestational age, the term Wilson\u2013Mikity syndrome (pulmonary dysmaturity syndrome)1may be applied to describe the radiographic findings. An esophagram was normal, revealing no evidence suggestive of a vascular ring or vascular sling. Imaging Studies.A chest radiograph (Panel A) and a corresponding computed tomographic angiogram with coronal reformatting (Panel B) reveal borderline cardiomegaly and a prominent pulmonary arterial shadow (Panel A, arrow; Panel B, P). The dilatation of the ascending aorta can also be seen (Panel B, A). An axial image (Panel C) shows dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (P) and its left (L) and right (R) branches, as well as the ascending aorta (A). (D denotes the descending aorta.) The left main stem bronchus is compressed by dilated vessels. Diffuse multifocal pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are present, characterized by areas of hyperaeration alternating with ground-glass opacities and subsegmental lung collapse. Sagittally reformatted images (Panels D and E) show relative narrowing of the transverse aortic arch (Panel D, arrows) between the ascending aorta (Panel D, A) and the descending aorta (Panel D, D) and show patent ductus arteriosus (Panel E, arrowhead [represents direction of flow]), findings indicative of left-to-right shunting from the descending aorta into the dilated main pulmonary artery (Panel E, P). The caliber of the right ventricular outflow tract is relatively normal (Panel E, arrow); this finding is indicative of the absence of a large, intracardiac shunt. The severe degree of pulmonary-artery dilatation was interpreted as indicative of pulmonary hypertension caused by the shunt through the patent ductus arteriosus (Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome) or resulting from a primary cause (or a combination thereof). A diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure of an unknown cause was made. The patient was transferred to a second hospital. Twenty-seven days before this admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed at the second hospital, revealed extensive periventricular gray-matter heterotopia, a large cisterna magna, and micrognathia, with no evidence of intracranial venous thrombosis. Cranial MRI.An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows foci of heterotopic gray matter lining the right lateral ventricle (arrows). A midsagittal T1-weighted image (Panel B) shows micrognathia (anterior arrow) and a large cisterna magna (posterior arrow). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale, a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect walled off by an aneurysmal membranous septum, and an effective small left-to-right shunt without left ventricular dilatation. There was also a competent bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the intercoronary commissure, with trivial stenosis, aortic dilatation, and a large patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional flow and pulmonary arterial pressures estimated to be at systemic levels, as well as preserved biventricular function. Genetics consultation was obtained, and results of microarray testing (GeneDx) were reportedly normal. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, but she returned within 12 hours, after an episode of severe respiratory distress. A brief episode of bradycardia was observed in the pediatric department, and she was transferred to the pediatric ICU. Twenty days before admission to this hospital, an orogastric feeding tube was placed because of weight loss. Three days later, CT angiography of the chest (Figure 1B through 1E) revealed dilatation of the ascending aorta, a large patent ductus arteriosus with a relatively small-caliber transverse aortic arch and no focal coarctation, an enlarged pulmonary-artery trunk (1.6 cm in diameter), enlarged left and right main pulmonary arteries (indicative of pulmonary hypertension), and large lung volumes. Scattered bandlike and ground-glass opacities and areas of hyperaeration were seen in both lungs. Nine days before this admission, when the patient was 7 weeks 3 days of age, cardiac catheterization was performed, and the patent ductus arteriosus was closed with the use of a 6-mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II device. The pulmonary arterial pressure was 51/23 mm Hg (mean, 35), and the aortic pressure 53/24 mm Hg (mean, 36). There was no substantial change in the pulmonary arterial pressure after the ductus was closed (pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg [mean, 36]; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg [mean, 67]) or when the patient received supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 1.0 (pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg [mean, 36]; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg [mean, 67]). The patient was transferred back to the first hospital, which was closer to her home. Despite closure of the patent ductus arteriosus, the patient\u2019s respiratory status did not improve, and she required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water. The patient\u2019s interest in oral feedings decreased and continuous nasogastric tube feedings were begun, but no appreciable weight gain was noted. There was no evidence of inability to feed or of abnormalities on an esophagram. She was transferred to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. Medications on transfer were famotidine, furosemide, metoclopramide, and (as needed) simethicone for gastric distress and a glycerine suppository for constipation; she also received continuous nasogastric feeding with formula. The patient lived with her parents and maternal relatives. Her mother had smoked during pregnancy, had taken lamotrigine for a seizure disorder that had been diagnosed when she was a teenager, and had hyperflexible joints. She and the patient\u2019s maternal grandmother had periventricular heterotopia. A maternal half-aunt also had a seizure disorder. The patient\u2019s father had a history of depression; two paternal half-sisters were healthy. The patient\u2019s mother was of European ancestry; her father was of French and Polish ancestry. On examination, the patient\u2019s weight was 3.18 kg (below the first percentile for age), the length 48.25 cm, and the head circumference 37 cm. The maximal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C; the systemic systolic blood pressure ranged from 79 to 96 mm Hg, the diastolic blood pressure from 46 to 57 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure, 50 to 60 mm Hg), the heart rate from 120 to 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 20 to 50 breaths per minute. The sutures were open, and the facial appearance was not dysmorphic. The hair of the scalp and eyebrows was thin, and a natal tooth was present. The eyes were widely spaced, with grey\u2013blue sclera. There were bilateral fine crackles in the lungs (with more crackles in the right lung than in the left), with mild subcostal and suprasternal retractions; no associated stridor, wheezing, grunting, or nasal flaring was present. No cardiac murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft, with bowel sounds. Muscle tone was poor, and there was poor visual tracking of a toy. When the patient was asleep, the oxygen saturation decreased to between 80 and 89% while she was receiving CPAP with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water through nasal prongs. As she continued to receive CPAP, the Fio2increased to 0.4 and the oxygen saturation rose to greater than 95%. The next day, an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 153 beats per minute and was normal for the patient\u2019s age. On the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, we performed repeat transthoracic echocardiography, which showed the findings reported earlier: the presence of a well-situated ductal occluder device, no coarctation, no residual ductal-level shunting, and normal biventricular size and function.

The patient had been generally well until approximately 2 years before the current admission, when persistent pain of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine developed. Approximately 11 months before admission, he fell and had increasing back spasms thereafter, with partial improvement after chiropractic treatment. During the 2 months before admission, he lost approximately 10 lb (4.5 kg) and his back pain became more severe; he rated it at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain was chronic with exacerbations, was localized in the thoracic and lumbar regions without radiation, worsened when he lay flat (despite the administration of narcotic agents for pain control), and diminished with ambulation. On the morning of admission, MRI was performed (without the administration of gadolinium) at another hospital to evaluate the patient's increasing symptoms (Figure 1). Fluid-sensitive images showed that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies (T10 and T11) was filled with fluid, and there was prominent bone marrow edema involving T10 and T11. These findings raised diagnostic concern about the possibility of diskitis\u2013osteomyelitis or fracture with pseudoarthrosis. MRI Scan of the Spine.On the day of admission, MRI of the spine was performed. A fluid-sensitive sagittal image of the thoracic spine shows that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies is filled with fluid (Panel A, arrow). There is also prominent bone marrow edema involving the adjacent vertebral bodies. A fat-sensitive sagittal image of the lumbar spine shows bridging ossifications at the levels of the T12\u2013L1 disk space and the L1\u2013L2 disk space (Panel B, arrows). The patient was advised to go to the emergency department at this hospital for evaluation. On arrival, he reported intermittent numbness in both feet (greater in the left toes than in the right toes), but he had no shortness of breath, chest pain, leg weakness, or urinary or bowel incontinence. He had hypertension, nonischemic idiopathic cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and fatigue with exertion. He had a history of obesity, depression, gout, nephrolithiasis, an adrenal nodule, and elevated results of liver-function tests, as well as one episode of iritis of the left eye 15 years before admission. He had also undergone numerous orthopedic procedures after traumatic injuries, including arthroplasty of the right knee and arthroscopy of the right ankle. The ankle symptoms, which included chronic discomfort requiring prolonged use of crutches, were thought to have exacerbated his back pain. Medications included lisinopril, furosemide, atenolol, allopurinol, fluoxetine, acetylsalicylic acid, and thiamine hydrochloride, with hydrocodone and diazepam as needed for back pain and spasms. He had no known allergies, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married, had adult children, and had worked in a service industry until he became disabled by his back and ankle pain. He walked with the use of a cane or crutches. His father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 152/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was tenderness on palpation over the paraspinal regions of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions, without pain over the spinal processes. The left knee was warm to the touch, and a small effusion was present. There was trace pitting edema bilaterally. Strength was normal in both legs, but there was mild loss of sensation of light touch in the toes. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of C-reactive protein was 8.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). A complete blood count, a white-cell differential count, and results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin.

The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, and unsteady gait developed; these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers. Five days before admission, a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner-ear symptoms was made; the symptoms decreased transiently. Three days before admission, the patient awoke at 4 a.m. and noted diminished muscle control, which was more severe in the arms than in the legs, and shaking in the hands. Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements. He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk. He was admitted to another hospital, where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria, which sometimes lessened with repeated testing. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and C-reactive protein; results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal. A chest radiograph reportedly showed small, bilateral pleural effusions, with no consolidation or pneumothorax. Results of computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 88% lymphocytes, 5% segmented neutrophils, and 7% monocytes. Other test results were pending. Results of electromyography were reportedly normal. Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered. During the hospitalization, horizontal diplopia developed, which disappeared when one eye was covered. On the third evening, sweats and chills occurred. The next day, he was transferred to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported diplopia, tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs, increased urinary frequency, night sweats, and chills, with no numbness, tingling, pain, headaches, neck stiffness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rashes. He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years, and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission, after evaluation by positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest had revealed increased, high18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of mediastinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent, nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalinization; silver and acid-fast staining had shown no organisms. A 4-month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission. Four months before this admission, a 4-month course of prednisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient also had hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease with stent placement, congestive heart failure, complete heart block, ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator had been implanted, mild asthma associated with allergies (which he had had since childhood), allergic rhinitis, and recent dental surgery, for which he had received unknown antibiotics for a period of 7 days. Medications were cholecalciferol, doxazosin, atorvastatin, sotalol, low-dose aspirin, folic acid, a multivitamin, fluticasone by inhalation, enoxaparin (subcutaneously), and, as needed, ipratropium by inhalation and nitroglycerin (sublingually). He had received that year\u2019s seasonal influenza vaccine. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His mother was more than 90 years of age and had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was being treated with prednisone; his father had had a stroke, and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 93/53 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had subtle deficits in episodic memory, including difficulty in recounting elements of his own recent medical history. The pupils were round and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm in diameter to 2 mm. Extraocular movements were full, without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown. He had horizontal diplopia in all directions, with mild ptosis of the right eyelid. Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling, and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks. Other cranial-nerve examinations were normal; however, the first cranial nerve was not tested. Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms, with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity. Strength was rated 4+ out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of 5. Light-touch sensation was preserved throughout. The deep-tendon reflexes were rated 1+ and were symmetric at the triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus. Plantar responses were mute on both feet. There was prominent arm-shaking on finger-to-nose testing when the patient\u2019s eyes were open; the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed. Rapid alternating movements were normal, as were the results of heel-to-shin testing and mirroring testing. Gait and stance were not tested. Blood levels of troponin T were normal, as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. One dose of cefepime was administered, followed by ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin, and cardiac and bronchodilator medications. Laboratory Data. During the first hospital day, nausea and vomiting occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.8\u00b0C. Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence, decreased orientation and ability to be aroused, slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech, and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia. Diplopia, right-eyelid ptosis, and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position (i.e., when the patient was looking forward) were present, with no nuchal rigidity. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Gram\u2019s staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes, a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells, and mixed flora; sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram-negative rods,Candida albicansandAspergillus fumigatus,and normal flora. Blood and urine cultures remained sterile. The temperature rose to 40.1\u00b0C. Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day. On the third hospital day, glucocorticoids were begun for hypotension. On the fourth hospital day, hyponatremia and progressive generalized weakness occurred, and fevers continued. CT images of the head on the fourth hospital day, obtained before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were normal for the patient\u2019s age (Figure 1A). Brain Imaging Studies.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed on the 4th hospital day, was normal (Panel A). Contrast-enhanced CT performed 5 days later revealed new, diffuse sulcal effacement and hypodensities in the white matter that were suggestive of edema and brain swelling (Panel B). New leptomeningeal enhancement and increased ventricular size could also be seen. On the 10th hospital day, CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed obliteration of the sulci and progression of hypodensities in both gray and white matter, as well as blurring of the gray\u2013white junction (Panel C). Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves, with diffuse irregular delta\u2013theta slowing. Lorazepam was administered, which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status. On the fifth hospital day, somnolence increased and mental status worsened. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar puncture showed an increased number of lymphocytes with admixed neutrophils, macrophages, and occasional plasma cells, and no evidence of malignant cells; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Pressors for hypotension were administered intravenously; morphine sulfate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation begun. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The next day, blood levels of thyrotropin, vitamin B12, folate, and cortisol were normal, as were results of liver function tests; testing for 1,3-beta-d-glucan was negative. Methylprednisolone and amiodarone were begun, and sotalol was stopped. Liposomal amphotericin was administered for 2 days. On the seventh hospital day, levetiracetam was begun. The next day, the level of N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide was 8227 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 900), and troponin T levels remained low. On the ninth hospital day, another lumbar puncture was performed, and the CSF was analyzed (Table 1). Later that evening, the pupils became nonreactive. Neurosurgical consultation was obtained, and additional imaging studies were performed. Contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed new, extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, sulcal effacement, and marked expansion of the corpus callosum, which indicated brain swelling and edema. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also present (Figure 1B).", "true_dx": "Granulomatous amebic encephalitis, caused by acanthamoeba species.

Ten days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home. During the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink. One day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine. On the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient\u2019s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition. In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19\u2013related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as \u201csullen,\u201d and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of episodes of altered consciousness. She had been well until the age of 24 years, when she began having episodes of \u201ca feeling of walking through a cloud,\u201d hearing spoken words without understanding, an inability to speak, and vertigo. A witness described events lasting less than 1 minute, during which the patient would stare at her hands, make gripping movements, and sometimes swear, and then be confused for 2 to 3 minutes. She had little memory of events after the episodes. During several episodes, she lost muscle tone and collapsed. During the next 8 years, episodes recurred at an accelerating rate, sometimes with loss of consciousness, abrupt collapse, and occasional incontinence. The frequency increased 4 to 5 days before menses. Three months before this evaluation, the patient struck her head during a typical episode. She was admitted to another hospital, where results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, Holter monitoring, routine and 3-day ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG), and multiple blood tests were reportedly normal; no episodes occurred during monitoring. There was no symptomatic improvement after the administration of triptans or beta-blockers. Subsequently, the frequency of episodes increased to at least daily. On evaluation at this hospital, she reported no fever, chills, rashes, neck pain, tinnitus, baseline vertigo, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, weakness, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or changes in vision, hearing, balance, gait, or bladder habits. Between the ages of 9 and 22 years, she had had occasional episodes of syncope after painful stimuli (such as immunizations or blood draws). She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and children and worked in a pharmacy. She drank alcohol infrequently, had stopped drinking caffeinated beverages after the onset of these symptoms, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of headaches and drug abuse, and her father was healthy; there was no family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal, with appropriate orthostatic changes. A detailed neurologic examination and the general physical examination were normal. A diagnosis of probable complex partial seizures with secondary generalization was made, and the patient was advised to stop driving. Two months later, a 72-hour ambulatory EEG captured 10 seizures arising from the left temporal lobe, all of which were noted by the patient. Lamotrigine was administered and the dosage was increased to 150 mg twice daily, with reduction in the frequency of events from three times daily to approximately once every 3 days. One month later, MRI of the brain was performed. MRI was performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1), in accordance with an epilepsy protocol. On T2-weighted images, there is a well-demarcated focus of increased signal intensity in the left inferomedial temporal lobe. The mass does not enhance with gadolinium. It has heterogeneous signal intensity that is predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The mass involves the occipitotemporal (fusiform) gyrus and causes mild local mass effect. The appearance is most suggestive of a primary brain neoplasm, such as a low-grade glioma. In retrospect, the same finding is present on the study from 6 months earlier, although it is harder to identify because of the positioning of the slices. MRI Images of the Brain.A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) and a T2-weighted axial image (Panel B) from an MRI scan obtained at the level of the temporal lobes show a heterogeneous but predominantly hyperintense mass lesion in the inferior left temporal lobe (arrows). During the next 7 months, the patient continued to have staring spells, some of which were associated with sudden loss of postural tone and collapse. Antiseizure medications, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and clonazepam, were aggressively adjusted without a clinically significant effect.

Six years before the current evaluation, the patient received a diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma of the left shoulder. He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab. Four months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later. When the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night.

The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and 1B) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D), the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal. Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis, Other Hospital.At the time of admission to the other hospital, coronal (Panel A) and axial (Panel B) images from CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. Surgical clips related to a previous cholecystectomy are visible (black arrow), and the common bile duct measures 7 mm in diameter, with smooth distal tapering to the ampulla (white arrowheads). Small-bowel loops of normal caliber are seen throughout the abdomen (white arrows). There is mesenteric edema (black arrowhead) and anasarca (not shown). One day after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel C) and axial (Panel D) T2-weighted images from magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. The common bile duct again measures 7 mm in diameter (arrowheads), without choledocholithiasis. A 1.9-cm simple cyst is seen in the left kidney (arrow). Eight days after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel E) and axial (Panel F) images from CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. There are new dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that are not seen on the initial CT scan; the loops measure up to 4 cm in diameter, with an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant (arrows). After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient\u2019s discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1E and 1F), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant. Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1), and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient\u2019s overall health, the patient\u2019s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline \u2014 all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes.

and jerking movements of the right arm and leg. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred. Two previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares. Medications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclopramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status. The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patient\u2019s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.

The patient had been well until approximately 5 days before admission, at 28 weeks of gestation, when she noted feeling warm, which she attributed to a malfunctioning air-conditioning system at work. Three days before admission, malaise and headaches occurred. The next day, she called her health care providers about her symptoms and reported Braxton Hicks contractions and frequent fetal movement, with no fevers, vaginal bleeding, or leaking of fluid. She was advised to rest and increase her fluid intake. That night, she took diphenhydramine for sleep. The day before admission, she came to the outpatient obstetrics clinic of this hospital because of a temperature of 37.4\u00b0C. She reported decreased fetal movement at home, which improved on arrival to the clinic. She was taking prenatal vitamins. She was allergic to cephalexin and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which caused a rash, and to multiple fruits and vegetables, which caused anaphylaxis. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable uterine contractions. On a nonstress test, the average fetal heart rate was 125 beats per minute, with moderate variability and positive accelerations; these findings were interpreted as reassuring. On ultrasonography, fetal biometric measurements were consistent with a weight of 1244 g (51st percentile for 28 weeks 4 days of gestation), and there was appropriate gradual growth since a previous scan had been obtained, as well as a normal volume of amniotic fluid; the fetus was active. Later that day, the patient traveled to a coastal area in Massachusetts that she visited weekly. That evening, increased fatigue, diffuse body aches, low back pain, and an earache occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.6\u00b0C. The obstetrician who was on call that evening recommended that the patient go to a local emergency department for evaluation; the examination was reportedly normal. There was a platelet count of 125,000 per cubic millimeter, and a peripheral-blood smear showed no evidence of babesia; other laboratory test results were reportedly negative. Results of testing for Lyme disease were pending. The patient returned to her coastal vacation residence. Overnight, the temperature rose to 38.8\u00b0C. On the morning of admission, the patient called her obstetrician\u2019s office at this hospital to report fever, with a current temperature of 37.4\u00b0C. She was advised to take acetaminophen, drink fluids, rest, and return for evaluation if she began feeling worse. Later that day, the temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C and nausea developed. That evening, she presented to the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. On presentation, the patient reported mild headache, neck stiffness, a left earache, intermittent contractions, and a possible erythematous rash on her right shin; she had no joint symptoms, vomiting, ear drainage, hearing difficulty, or upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. She was gravida 3, had had two previous spontaneous miscarriages, and had received prenatal care, with testing that was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. The patient had a history of thrombophilia and gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with aspirin use and was heterozygous for factor V Leiden. She reported contact with an indoor cat at home and with outdoor cats and dogs at the home of relatives; she knew of bats in the vicinity of her home and mice in the basement of her coastal vacation residence. She had no known sick contacts, insect bites, or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. She had traveled to Western Europe, Central America, Mexico, and Asia within the previous 3 years. She worked in an office, had stopped smoking 5 years earlier, and had stopped drinking alcohol when she became pregnant. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, and the fetal heart rate was 130 beats per minute, with accelerations. There was a faint area of lacy, blanching erythema (4 cm in diameter) on the right shin and no lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell indexes and results of coagulation tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, uric acid, and haptoglobin. Thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears of peripheral blood were negative for babesia; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. Laboratory Data. During the next 4.5 hours, the temperature rose to 38.9\u00b0C. Ceftriaxone and rifampin were administered. During the next 3 days, results of testing for hepatitis A and B viruses were suggestive of protective immunity, and results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were suggestive of past infection; testing was negative for cytomegalovirus nucleic acids, HIV, heterophile antibodies, and IgM and IgG antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferi,Coxiella burnetii, ehrlichia, and anaplasma.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admission, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 1A). Imaging Studies Obtained before Admission.A CT scan of the abdomen obtained 8 months before admission (Panel A) shows marked hepatosplenomegaly. A chest radiograph obtained 1 month before admission (Panels B and C) shows bilateral, perihilar, diffuse ground-glass opacities with additional patchy opacities at the lung bases and no evidence of pleural effusion. Seven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling developed; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the patient\u2019s abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-function test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 (portal and periportal) fibrosis. Special stains for organisms (acid-fast and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver stains) were negative. CT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme level. Four months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patient\u2019s abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone. Three months before this admission, the patient stopped prednisone therapy because of irritability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patient\u2019s liver function revealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of methotrexate was increased to 25 mg per week. During the next month, the patient noted fatigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases (Figure 1B and 1C). Levofloxacin was administered. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepatosplenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day. On the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported progressive dyspnea on exertion and being unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills. The patient had a history of preeclampsia,Helicobacter pyloriinfection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had undergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and prednisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculosis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The level of alanine aminotransferase was 38 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 100).Streptococcus pneumoniaeandLegionella pneumophilaantigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2C) showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest (Figure 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a background of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions. Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained on admission to this hospital (Panels A and B) show persistent hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense lesion in the spleen (Panel B, arrow). A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Panel C) shows progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. A CT scan of the chest (Panel D) confirms these findings and also shows new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Supplemental oxygen was increased to a rate of 5 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. Cultures of the blood were obtained.

The patient had been generally well until approximately 5 weeks before this admission, when fever (to a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C), chills, cough, night sweats, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia occurred. Four weeks before this admission, he was seen by his physician, who noted that he had had a weight loss of 5 kg in the previous 7 months. Urinalysis and cultures of urine and blood were reportedly negative. A chest radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, were reportedly negative and were not available for review. The diarrhea resolved, but other symptoms persisted. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the chest reportedly revealed diffuse symmetric fine interstitial reticular lung nodularities, small pleural effusions, and mild splenomegaly. Two days later, the patient fell because of profound weakness and was admitted to another hospital. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (with previous bypass grafting), congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease (with previous aortofemoral bypass surgery), non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gout, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also had transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder that was in remission after treatment including bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy, which had most recently been administered 7 months earlier. Medications taken at home were sitagliptin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, atenolol, clopidogrel, finasteride, dutasteride, terazosin, allopurinol, citalopram, folate, a multivitamin, and ipratropium\u2013albuterol (by inhalation). On examination, the temperature was 39.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/82 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air and 97% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. There was abdominal distention, with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a horseshoe kidney and a mildly heterogeneous liver. A chest radiograph showed a patchy opacity in the right midzone (Figure 1A). Transthoracic echocardiography reportedly revealed no evidence of endocarditis. During the first week, testing was negative for influenza antigen, as well as for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,Borrelia burgdorferi, ehrlichia,Anaplasma phagocytophilum, babesia, rickettsia (Rocky Mountain spotted fever), parvovirus, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Cultures of the blood and urine were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and aspirate, which was performed because of the pancytopenia, was normal. Diffuse bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema developed; fluid was restricted, and furosemide administered. Chest Radiographs.A frontal chest radiograph that was obtained on admission to the other hospital (Panel A) shows a patchy opacity in the right midzone. A follow-up frontal chest radiograph that was obtained 5 days later (Panel B) shows a persistent patchy opacity in the right midzone and diffuse reticular opacities in the lung bases. Laboratory Data. On the fifth day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent patchy opacity in the right midzone and diffuse reticular opacities in the lung bases (Figure 1B). The next day, a CT scan of the chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs; the ground-glass opacities in the dependent lower lobes were more confluent. There were also small bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. On the 9th day, hemoptysis occurred, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The rate of oxygen supplementation was increased to 3 liters per minute. Bronchoalveolar lavage reportedly revealed no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or malignant cells; cultures of the lavage fluid were negative. After consultation with a rheumatologist, methylprednisolone (1 g daily) was administered for 3 days, followed by prednisone (60 mg daily). The fevers initially improved but then recurred. On the 15th day, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. Pathological examination of a lung-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed extensive noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and granulomas in both bronchiolocentric and lymphangitic distributions. On the 18th day, hemoptysis recurred, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 86% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air. A second CT scan of the chest (Figure 2) revealed persistent diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticulations in the lower lobes bilaterally; these findings were now visible because of the decrease in size of the bilateral pleural effusions. There was evidence of wedge resections of the right upper and lower lobes and subcutaneous emphysema. Chest CT Scans.Axial CT scans of the chest show diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticulations in the lower lobes bilaterally (Panel A, arrowhead), as well as subcutaneous emphysema related to the recent lung biopsy (Panels A and B, arrows). Vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered. The day before this admission, confusion developed, with associated myoclonus during sleep and a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C. Lumbar puncture and CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were performed; the studies revealed atrophy but no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or space-occupying masses. The dose of glucocorticoid therapy was decreased. On the 22nd day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent opacity in the right midzone and subcutaneous emphysema. Ethambutol, rifampin, and isoniazid were administered. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was transferred and admitted to this hospital. The patient was allergic to contrast dye. He lived alone and had retired from the construction industry, with past exposure to asbestos. He had a 46-pack-year history of smoking and had stopped 10 years earlier; he had stopped drinking alcohol 20 years earlier and did not use illicit drugs. He had traveled to Mexico in the remote past. His son, who lived nearby, owned chickens. He was a hunter and had had exposures to deer, rabbits, and pheasants in the previous 5 months. His father and brother may have had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the patient appeared to be mildly uncomfortable and was flushed. The respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air; the other vital signs were normal. He had shallow ulcerations on the right side of the hard palate, crackles in both lung bases, occasional expiratory wheezes, and trace ankle edema on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of phosphorus and total and direct bilirubin were normal; testing for antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen was negative, as were the results of a lung panel for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Antibiotic agents and glucocorticoids were not administered.

Seven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter]), a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter]), and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion. After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started. One month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Three months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. During the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing. The patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis. Eleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion. Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started. On the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated.

During the evaluation, the patient described his mood as \u201cnot that good.\u201d He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing \u201cdepressive episode\u201d during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma. The patient\u2019s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins. The patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs. The patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault. The patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had \u201cput a Vodou curse on me\u201d and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but \u201cthe damage cannot be undone.\u201d For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see \u201cdiscoloration\u201d when they looked at his face. In his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient\u2019s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work. The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect. On examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier.

The patient had been well until 2 p.m. on the day before admission, when nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting developed. The next morning, he was seen at another hospital, where he reported increasing asthma and right-sided back pain, which he rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On examination, he was in moderate distress. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/69 mm Hg, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and he had scattered inspiratory wheezes, pallor and decreased skin turgor, and puncture wounds on his arms and hands. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was normal. Ipratropium and albuterol were given by inhalation, and famotidine, ondansetron, normal saline, metoclopramide, and methylprednisolone were administered intravenously; hydromorphone was then administered because of increasing pain. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital after the oral (but not intravenous) administration of contrast material, did not reveal any findings of acute disease (e.g., bowel distention or bowel-wall thickening) to explain the patient's severe pain and vomiting. The spleen appeared small, measuring 8 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension (normal range for adults, 12 to 14 cm), with at least two granulomas. There was also mild enlargement of the caudate lobe of the liver. Shortly after CT was performed, skin mottling and livedo developed, and additional history was obtained. Three days before presentation, the patient was bitten on his hands and forearms while bathing his dog; later that day, his wife washed the wounds with hydrogen peroxide. Levofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam were administered at the other hospital. He was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 23 hours after the onset of symptoms. On presentation, the patient reported malaise, shaking chills, a burning pins-and-needles sensation in his limbs, and diffuse body pain that he rated at 10 out of 10. He had had head trauma caused by a rusty nail a few days before presentation and dental extractions 1 to 2 weeks before presentation. He also had a history of asthma, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, chronic back pain, and alcohol abuse (with recent consumption of up to 18 beers daily); he had stopped drinking 3 days before admission. His medications were citalopram and omeprazole daily, alprazolam as needed for anxiety, and albuterol and a combination of budesonide and formoterol, which were administered by inhalation as needed for asthma. He was allergic to codeine, and tramadol had caused auditory hallucinations. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily (and had done so for 30 years), and he had used illicit drugs in the past. He reported no recent tick bites or exposures to other animals, sick persons, raw oysters, freshwater, or saltwater. He lived with his wife and his dog, which was fully vaccinated. He worked sporadically and had recently installed air-conditioning systems. His parents both died at 72 years of age from myocardial infarctions. On examination, the patient appeared ill, anxious, and diaphoretic. The temperature was 35.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 154/102 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the lower quadrants and without guarding or rebound. Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs, there was some mottling on his flanks and abdomen, and his fingers and ears were slightly blue (Figure 1). There were numerous lacerations with necrotic edges and scratch marks on his hands and forearms; the largest mark on his right forearm (3 to 4 cm in length) had a surrounding border (5 to 7 cm in diameter) with a purplish tinge and without exudate, crepitus, or bullae. Capillary refill occurred in 5 seconds. The remainder of the examination was normal, as were blood levels of glucose, direct and total bilirubin, phosphorus, globulin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, methemoglobin, and haptoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph with poor inspiratory effort showed elevation of the left hemidiaphragm that did not have an obvious cause; there was no evidence of pneumonia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and low-voltage QRS complexes, with Q waves and ST-segment elevations (\u22642 mm) in the anterior leads. Vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, alprazolam, and 3 liters of normal saline were administered, and calcium and magnesium were given as needed. Photographs of the Hands, Flank, and Legs.On admission, the patient's fingers appeared slightly blue (Panel A), and there was mottling of the skin on his abdomen and flank (Panel B). Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs (Panel C). During the first 3 hours after presentation, the level of pain decreased (rated at 4 out of 10); the respiratory rate ranged from 22 to 40 breaths per minute, and wheezing developed in the anterior lung fields. The rash progressed to involve the back, chest, and abdomen, with purpura that blanched in some areas. During the next 2 hours, the patient became increasingly confused, with delirium and periods of agitation. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. Etomidate and succinylcholine were administered, the trachea was intubated, and positive-pressure ventilation was begun. Penicillin, ceftazidime, doxycycline, heparin, and hydromorphone were added, vancomycin was continued, and cefepime and metronidazole were stopped. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or infarction. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Methylprednisolone was administered. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. A frontal chest radiograph showed opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as a pleural effusion on the left side (Figure 2A). Radiographs of the Chest and Forearm.A frontal chest radiograph (Panel A), obtained on the day of admission, shows interstitial opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings that are consistent with pulmonary edema. There is also new blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a hazy opacity in the left lower lobe that is obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, findings that are consistent with a pleural effusion. The next day, radiographs of the right hand and forearm (Panel B) were obtained that show soft-tissue reticulation, a feature that is consistent with edema. There is no soft-tissue gas. On the second day, the temperature rose to 39.6\u00b0C. Dermatologic examination revealed diffuse, symmetric, coalescing, retiform patches of purple ecchymoses and purpura involving most of the abdomen, chest, arms, legs, and face but sparing the forehead. The rash was predominantly nonblanching. Multiple discrete bite and scratch marks were present on the hands and arms; the largest was on the left forearm. The earlobes and fingers had a bluish hue, which persisted with elevation and warming, and did not have bullae, target lesions, mucosal involvement, crepitus, or exudate. Radiographs of the right hand and forearms showed soft-tissue swelling but no soft-tissue gas (Figure 2B). Noninvasive vascular studies revealed thrombosis in the right radial vein; the results were otherwise normal. The plasma ammonia level was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and hepatitis B surface antigen was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun. Clindamycin, meropenem, hydromorphone, aspirin, omeprazole, ipratropium, and albuterol (by inhalation) were administered, and vancomycin and ceftazidime were stopped. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at the bedside and revealed a large wall-motion abnormality in the apical two thirds of the left and right ventricles. On the third day, rigidity and cyanosis of the right arm developed. Irradiated platelets, washed red cells, and additional fresh-frozen plasma were transfused. Narcotic analgesic agents and midazolam were administered for comfort.

The patient had been in his usual health until 4 days before admission, when increasing fatigue, malaise, headache, intermittent testicular discomfort, yellowed eyes, dark urine, nausea, and diffuse body aches developed and chronic leg pain worsened. No fever, rash, hematuria, dysuria, melena, or neurologic symptoms were present. On the day of admission, he came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been generally well, with intermittent asthma, acne, and chronic leg pain until 4 months earlier, when he traveled from an urban area of New England to his family's home in North Africa and stayed for 3 months. While he was there, a prolonged cough productive of green sputum developed, associated with fatigue, subjective fevers, chills, drenching night sweats, and intermittent dyspnea at rest, and he reportedly had a weight loss of 9.1 kg. Ten days after his return to New England, and 20 days before this admission, he was seen in the medical clinic at this hospital. On evaluation at that time, the patient appeared well. The weight was 92.7 kg, the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.6, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the blood pressure and respirations were normal. Evaluation revealed mild acne, nasal turbinates that were boggy and pale and had clear secretions, slight tonsillar enlargement, inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and expiratory wheezes in both lung apexes, and surgical scars on the right leg. The level of platelets and results of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was normal. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test was negative. The patient was advised to continue the administration of fluticasone and albuterol by inhalers, which had been prescribed as treatment for asthma. He returned home. On the day of admission, he called his physician's office and was advised to go to the emergency department for evaluation. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient had a history of fractures of the right leg after a motor-vehicle accident 3 years earlier, which required internal fixation of the tibia for nonunion, as well as bone and skin grafting; he had persistent chronic leg pain and venous swelling. One year before this admission, after tibial surgery, the hematocrit decreased to 34.4%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 77 fl (normal range, 80 to 100); the anemia resolved within 4 months. Other medications included ginkgo biloba, a multivitamin, and nicotine patches for smoking cessation. He had no known allergies to medication. The patient had emigrated from North Africa to the United States 9 years earlier. He was a student, smoked marijuana and cigarettes, and reported no current alcohol or intravenous drug use. He was sexually active with his girlfriend. While the patient was visiting his family in North Africa, his 14-year-old brother died of an unspecified disease. During that trip, the patient was exposed to sheep and drank unpasteurized cow's milk. His mother had osteopenia; his father and four other siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 123/85 mm Hg and the pulse 115 beats per minute; the temperature, respirations, and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient appeared tired, with conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. The second heart sounds were loud, without murmurs. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was greatest in the right lower and left upper quadrants; the testicles were diffusely tender, without masses. Mild tenderness was present over the right knee and anterior shin, with healed surgical scars; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, white-cell differential count, and red-cell indexes (mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lipase, thyrotropin, folate, and vitamin B12. Thick and thin peripheral-blood smears and rapid testing for malaria antigen, antibodies to HIV, and heterophile antibodies were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. The results of urinalysis were normal, and the stool was guaiac-negative. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Narcotic analgesia, ondansetron, dalteparin, phosphorus supplementation, and intravenous fluids were administered. Toxicologic examination of the urine revealed the presence of opiates and cannabinoids. During the next 2 days, jaundice gradually improved. Blood cultures remained sterile. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed mild hepatic steatosis; ultrasonography of the scrotum was normal.

The patient had been well until 2 days before admission, when he choked while eating a piece of chicken during dinner. He became fearful of swallowing and was unable to finish the meal despite cutting his food into small pieces. The next day, he vomited after trying to eat ice cream, and his daily fluid intake decreased to only 710 ml (24 oz) of water. He reportedly needed his mother near him throughout the day and had an \u201cirrational fear\u201d of choking. He had not had recent fevers, rhinorrhea, cough, or sore throat. Nine days earlier, during a routine annual examination at the clinic of the patient\u2019s primary care pediatrician, the patient\u2019s mother reported that he had had several episodes of inspiratory stridor while he was sleeping during the past few weeks; the patient was referred to an otolaryngologist, but this visit had not yet occurred. On the day of this presentation, the patient consumed only small sips of water, reported feeling hungry, and slept most of the day. His mother noted that, in addition to the inspiratory stridor during sleep, the patient had some gasping for air that was associated with deep involuntary burping. She contacted a physician at this hospital and was advised to bring the patient to the emergency department for evaluation. The patient had been delivered at full term. He had a nuchal cord at birth, and the birth weight was 3.6 kg. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 9, respectively, and initial resuscitation efforts were provided. Subsequent growth and development were reportedly normal. As an infant, the patient had had gastroesophageal reflux and a milk-protein allergy, and he had received some training on sensory-integration skills during childhood. Immunizations had been administered through 2.5 years of age; after that age, the recommended routine vaccinations were refused by the patient\u2019s parents. The patient had keratosis pilaris and eczema. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his family in a suburb and was a student who received writing support. His younger brother had moderate autism spectrum disorder, with verbal (but not conversational) skills, and had received diagnoses of PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) and vitamin D deficiency. Both parents were healthy. The patient\u2019s maternal grandfather had heart disease and non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, his maternal grandmother had had psoriasis and had died from breast cancer, an aunt had hypoglycemia, and his paternal grandmother had hypertension, hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was alert and appeared to be anxious. He had persistent involuntary burping, with evidence of drooling on his shirt. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/64 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the weight 54.1 kg (60th percentile for his age), and the height 160 cm (32nd percentile for his age). The oral mucosal membranes were dry. Sexual development was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). Results of examinations of cranial nerves II through XII were normal. The patient spoke clearly, and his gait, strength, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal. The remainder of the examination was also normal. His initial laboratory studies revealed profound hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, but other laboratory test results were normal, including blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase, as well as titers of antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. The corrected QT interval was reportedly mildly prolonged, at 471 msec. Laboratory Data. Because the patient had severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and supportive care. On examination, he refused to swallow, had persistent burping, and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d The leg muscles were hypertonic.

The patient had been well until the morning of the day of admission, when she awoke with a severe generalized headache. The headache worsened with movement, was not relieved by acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and was accompanied by nausea and one episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. The patient returned to sleep and awoke again several hours later with diffuse myalgias; her temperature was 37.7\u00b0C. At that time, she also noted a rash on her abdomen, chest, and right arm; the lesions were small, red, flat, nonpruritic, and nonpainful. She described these symptoms to her father, a physician, who advised her to go to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported that the nausea had resolved and that mild neck stiffness had developed. She had had bacterial meningitis at 9 years of age, with symptoms similar to those of the current illness. She had no history of otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, or skin infections. She had a remote history of hospitalization after a motor vehicle accident. Ten months before the current illness, she had had an episode of nephrolithiasis with spontaneous passage of a renal stone. She also had a history of anxiety. Her medications were citalopram and a combined estrogen\u2013progestin oral contraceptive. Immunizations were up to date and reportedly included vaccination againstNeisseria meningitidis. She had no known allergies. She lived alone, worked as a lawyer, and had not recently traveled outside New England or had exposure to sick persons. She had a new boyfriend but was not currently sexually active. She did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and she rarely consumed alcohol. Her parents lived nearby; she had had contact with their two dogs but had not had any recent tick bites, mosquito bites, or exposure to other animals. There was no family history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She had scattered petechiae on the chest, abdomen, and thighs and a purpuric lesion on the right shoulder that was tender on palpation without crepitus (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, lactic acid level, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase; other test results are shown inTable 1. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with trace ketones and 1+ bilirubin, occult blood, albumin, and urobilinogen by dipstick; there were 3 to 5 white cells and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field, with 1+ bacteria, transitional cells, renal tubular cells, squamous cells, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Lorazepam was administered and a lumbar puncture was performed, after which ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone were administered intravenously. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown inTable 1.

Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, and sodium phosphate were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed; the activated partial-thromboplastin time and levels of fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, and thed-dimer level was 785 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first hospital day, the patient continued to have a headache and was noted to have mild nuchal rigidity, but her fever and tachycardia resolved and her myalgias decreased; the remainder of the examination was unchanged.

Ten months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswere negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted. A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life,\u201d with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value, <1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema. MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation.Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the head (Panels A and B, respectively) show abnormal enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extends into the right superior orbital fissure and adjacent right middle cranial fossa (arrows). Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the cervical spine with fat suppression (Panels C and D, respectively) show abnormal pachymeningeal enhancement and thickening anteriorly in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 as well as more circumferentially with a posterior predominance at the cervicothoracic junction, with resultant variable canal stenosis and mild cord compression (arrows). A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands. On the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone. Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response. Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality. MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation.Repeat head and spinal MRI studies were obtained 2 weeks after treatment with rituximab was initiated. Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the head (Panels A and B, respectively) show increased abnormal enhancement on the right side (arrows) and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and left middle cranial fossa (arrowheads). Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the cervical spine with fat suppression (Panels C and D, respectively) show progression of the abnormal pachymeningeal enhancement with worsening canal stenosis and progressive cord compression but no cord signal abnormality (arrows). The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed.

Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks. Four years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands. Three months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, and anti\u2013U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms. The patient had a history of Graves\u2019 disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmoplegia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation.

The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers. On the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute (Figure 1). ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy. Electrocardiographic Studies.An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained on the initial presentation to the emergency department of the other hospital, on the day of the first admission (Panel A), shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute; borderline ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression are present in leads I, II, V5, and V6. An ECG obtained 10 days after the first admission (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute; ST-segment elevation and PR-depression are no longer present. An ECG obtained approximately 9.5 months after the first admission (Panel C) shows sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute; premature atrial and ventricular contractions are present, along with flattening of T waves. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities. Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient\u2019s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown inTable 1. ECG was performed. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present. Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric nephrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown inTable 1. Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and lightheadedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient\u2019s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords. The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time \u2014 including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes \u2014 was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation. One week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell \u201cworld\u201d backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffusely scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages. Lumbar puncture was also performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with a lymphocyte count of 99% (reference range, 40 to 80), the red-cell count was 35 per microliter (reference value, 0), and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter (reference range, 13 to 40); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test forBorrelia burgdorferiwere interpreted as negative. Over the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient\u2019s husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain. The patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vitamin B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 62 years of age. On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 5/5 throughout, except in the left leg (4/5). Reflexes were brisk throughout, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. MRI of the head was performed (Figure 1). FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensities and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. MRI of the Head.A T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) shows abnormal diffuse sulcal hyperintensity (arrowheads). A T1-weighted image obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel B) shows abnormal diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement (arrowheads). A susceptibility-weighted image (Panel C) shows abnormal sulcal hypointensity in multiple locations (arrowheads). Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), the lymphocyte count 85%, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter.

Ten months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5) and a white-cell count of 23,450 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with 81% lymphocytes and 4% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. Examination of the bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[15]/46,idem,t(2;12)(p13;p13),?del(10)(p13)[3]/46,idem,del(6)(p21),add(7)(p13)[2]. On next-generation sequencing, SNaPshot analysis identified aRUNX1mutation, and gene fusion analysis was positive forBCR-ABL1e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia withBCR-ABL1was made. Initial Bone Marrow\u2013Biopsy Specimen.An initial bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen was obtained 10 months before this presentation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the specimen (Panel A) shows markedly hypercellular marrow. At higher magnification (Panel B), there are larger blasts with fine chromatin (top half) and smaller blasts with more condensed chromatin (bottom half). Induction chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone was administered, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. One month later, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed 7% blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started, and dasatinib was continued. Seven months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response.BCR-ABL1was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Five months before this presentation, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched, unrelated donor after myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post-transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia. Two months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response, noBCR-ABL1rearrangement, and full donor chimerism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months, the patient had worsening anemia, and dasatinib was stopped. Two days before this presentation, the patient noticed \u201clarge black blobs\u201d that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hospital and was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain, flashing lights, or floaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats, areas of swelling in the neck and groin, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest, upper back, and both arms. He had a history of chronic daily migraine headaches, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, famciclovir, omeprazole, and escitalopram, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food-service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather, and hypertension in his father. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with correction, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp examination revealed few cells in the anterior chamber, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), varicella\u2013zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also negative. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 2A and 2B) showed multiple new hyperintense lesions, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension, within the supratentorial and infratentorial regions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the central nervous system (CNS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures. Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.MRI was performed on admission to this hospital. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Panels A and B) show hyperintense lesions in the right frontal gyrus and the left occipital lobe.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT was also performed; PET images were rendered in soft tissue (Panels C, E, and G) and inverted grayscale (Panels D, F, and H). Axial PET-CT images at the cervical level (Panels C and D) show FDG-avid bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Axial PET-CT images at the axillary level (Panels E and F) show FDG-avid axillary lymphadenopathy that is greater on the right side than on the left side. Axial PET-CT images at the pelvic level (Panels G and H) show FDG-avid bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) was also performed. The PET-CT scans (Figure 2C through 2H) showed moderate-to-intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical, axillary, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The white-cell count was 21 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 61% lymphocytes, 27% neutrophils, and 3% eosinophils; the red-cell count was 16,000 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with xanthochromia present. Gram\u2019s staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells.

evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging. In childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids. Twelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed.

DLcodenotes diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and FVC forced vital capacity.\u2020On bronchodilator testing, a positive response was defined as an increase in the FEV1of more than 0.2 liters or by more than 12% after the administration of a bronchodilator. Eleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation \u2014 a patchy ground-glass pattern \u2014 at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <127), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol was prescribed. Five years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastroesophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range, <600), with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were undetectable. Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range, <5). The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmonologist; inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and weight loss was advised. Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown inTable 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown inTable 1. At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <114), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, andCladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patient\u2019s symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous benralizumab was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. One month later,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a \u201craspy\u201d voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years. The patient\u2019s medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizumab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisinopril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea. The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years.

The patient had been born in Puerto Rico by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks of gestation. Her mother did not smoke, drink alcohol, or take any medications during the pregnancy. Results of prenatal laboratory testing had reportedly suggested maternal hyperthyroidism, but follow-up studies revealed normal thyroid function. The delivery was uncomplicated, and the birth weight was 3.2 kg (50th percentile). The patient\u2019s growth had been assessed as normal until she was 9 months of age, when she attended a clinic visit. The weight was 7.0 kg (10th percentile), which was lower than the weight at the most recent clinic visit, 2 months earlier (7.1 kg [27th percentile]) (Figure 1). Follow-up appointments were scheduled. Growth Charts.Shown are the patient\u2019s growth charts, which include data on body length and weight (Panel A) and head circumference and weight-for-length (Panel B) relative to the percentiles for girls up to 24 months of age. The patient returned to the clinic when she was 12 months of age, and the weight was 7.3 kg (6th percentile). The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total carnitine, free carnitine, and ammonia; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.025, a pH of 6.0, 2+ leukocyte esterase, and trace blood by dipstick; on microscopic examination, squamous epithelial cells and bacteria were present and there were 2 to 5 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. A urine culture grew very few mixed bacteria. Nutritional shakes were prescribed through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Laboratory Data. When the patient attended a clinic visit 6 weeks later, the weight was 7.7 kg (7th percentile). The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was referred for evaluation by a geneticist, who reportedly did not suspect a genetic cause of poor weight gain. When the patient was 14.5 months of age, she was seen by a nutritionist; a detailed meal plan that was designed to provide a balanced, high-kilocalorie diet was recommended. The results of a sweat chloride test were reportedly normal. One month later, the patient was evaluated by an endocrinologist. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total carnitine, free carnitine, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiographic assessment of bone age in the left hand (according to the method of Greulich and Pyle) revealed a bone age of 1 year 6 months, which was within 1 SD of normal. Methimazole was prescribed; the patient\u2019s mother administered the drug for 3 days before stopping because of unspecified side effects. Two weeks later, the patient was seen by a second endocrinologist. The patient\u2019s mother reported that the child was an active toddler and that she had a strong appetite and ate a wide variety of foods throughout the day; however, she had not gained weight despite following the meal plan recommended by the nutritionist. On examination, the patient was thin, with wasting of the buttocks. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the external female genitalia were classified as Tanner stage 1 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). A glucometer and test strips were provided to the mother, with instructions to record the fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels. Ten days after this clinic visit, tests for thyrotropin-receptor antibodies and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Results of ultrasonography of the thyroid gland, which was performed 3 days later, were normal. At a follow-up visit in the endocrinology clinic when the patient was 17 months of age, the weight was 7.6 kg (<2nd percentile). Tests for antithyroglobulin antibodies, anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies, and antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were negative, and blood levels of phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, thyroid peroxidase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The endocrinologist recommended that the patient be evaluated in a multidisciplinary, coordinated pediatric-care system in the continental United States, and the patient and her mother relocated to New England the following month. When the patient was 19 months of age, she was seen in a pediatric clinic and directly admitted to the inpatient pediatric unit of a community hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation of failure to thrive. On admission, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the child ate large amounts of food (equal to the amounts eaten by her 5-year-old brother) and never seemed satisfied. The patient had no abdominal pain or diarrhea. When she was between 10 and 12 months of age, she had begun to vomit intermittently. Nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred approximately once per week thereafter; the mother attributed the vomiting to overeating. The patient had briefly been hospitalized during infancy for influenza and at 16 months of age for bronchiolitis. She had crawled at 7 months of age, cruised at 10 months of age, and walked at 12 months of age. She walked up steps with assistance, ran, spoke eight words, pointed to indicate wants, and scribbled spontaneously. The mother described the child as happy and playful and reported that she behaved as though she were healthy. The timing of dental eruption had been normal. The patient received no medications, had no known allergies, and had received routine childhood vaccinations. Since she had moved from Puerto Rico 1 month earlier, she had been living with her mother, 5-year-old brother, and step-grandmother in an urban area of New England. The patient\u2019s mother was healthy, her brother had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, and her father\u2019s medical history was unknown. On examination, the patient had cachexia; she otherwise appeared well and happy, was playful and active, and walked rapidly around the hospital room. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.4 kg (<1st percentile). The anterior fontanelle was closed, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 7.3 kg (<1st percentile); the results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, red-cell indexes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein; other test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient was in poor health, with end-stage renal disease that required hemodialysis. Two years before the current presentation, pathological examination of a renal-biopsy specimen revealed advanced global glomerulosclerosis with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as well as collapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, findings that were superimposed on advanced membranous nephropathy. Six months before the current presentation, evaluation at this hospital revealed severe hypertension, hyperkalemia, and azotemia. Hemodialysis was initiated. Three months before the current presentation, initial evaluation for renal transplantation revealed that the patient had received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis 11 years earlier (on the basis of a positive rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test at a 1:2 dilution and a negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis), for which he received three doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine at 1-week intervals; a follow-up RPR test that was performed 4 years before the current presentation was nonreactive. Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus were consistent with protective immunity. Testing was negative for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and positive for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Shortly thereafter, the patient noted a rash on his forearms that he thought was associated with oxycodone, which he was taking for pain associated with the placement of a new hemodialysis fistula. Three weeks before the current presentation, as part of the pretransplantation evaluation, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported no recent fevers, chills, or weight loss and no history of eczema, psoriasis, or a similar rash. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Nummular (circular or oval), scaly, plaquelike lesions were present on the trunk, arms, and legs, and there was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. An RPR test was reactive at a 1:1 dilution. Renal transplantation was postponed, pending evaluation by a dermatologist. During the next 3 weeks, the rash became pruritic and progressed, with more extensive involvement of the torso, arms, and legs. Three days before the current presentation, while awaiting dermatologic consultation, the patient fell and injured his right leg and left shoulder. Three days later, he came to the emergency department of this hospital because of pain with weight bearing and leg swelling. The patient had hypertension, a bicuspid aortic valve, and an ascending and aortic-root aneurysm; 13 years before this presentation, he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a negative chest radiograph. He had had unintentional weight loss of 12 kg during the previous 2 years. His medications were oxycodone with acetaminophen, calcitriol, calcium acetate, clonidine, diltiazem, labetalol, atorvastatin, sertraline, ergocalciferol, a multivitamin, and, during dialysis, epoetin alfa. He also topically applied an emollient and a 5% lidocaine patch. He had no known drug or food allergies. He was born in Haiti and had moved to the United States 30 years earlier. He was married and retired from work in a medical facility. He had smoked cigarettes for 15 years before stopping 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His parents had died in their 80s, and his siblings and children were well. There was no family history of skin cancer or other dermatologic diseases. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The right leg was erythematous, with increased warmth and tense nonpitting edema on the medial proximal leg, point tenderness on the medial leg below the knee, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, and no findings suggestive of a thrombosed vein. A diffuse rash was present on the torso, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the knee and leg showed no evidence of a fracture or dislocation. Noninvasive vascular studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep or superficial venous thrombosis. Vancomycin was administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the observation unit of this hospital. On examination by a dermatologist, the skin type was Fitzpatrick type VI. Large, brown, thin, flat-topped papules were widespread, and many coalesced into polygonal plaques. There was a powdery and occasionally thick scale on the neck, arms, axillae, wrists, dorsal hands, trunk, anterior thighs, legs, and feet (Figure 1). Wrinkling of axillary plaques was present bilaterally. Multiple thin, brown macules and patches with a collarette of scale were present on the palms, and a few were present on the soles. The buttocks and genitalia were spared.

The patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing. Two hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patient\u2019s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a \u201cdreamlike\u201d state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission. Review of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department. Two years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy and was treated with prednisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). The patient took vitamin B12and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin. On examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. On arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter). The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 weeks before admission to this hospital, when she underwent elective termination of pregnancy with methotrexate. The pregnancy had occurred despite the presence of an intrauterine device, and the device was removed a few days after the termination. Oral contraception was initiated. Three weeks later and 1 week before admission to this hospital, pain in the left upper quadrant, vaginal bleeding, and headache developed. The patient was admitted to another hospital. The blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin was 24 IU per liter (normal range, <6 IU per liter); the level had been 21,000 IU per liter 3 weeks earlier, when she was pregnant. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, amylase, lipase, total protein, and albumin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests, the prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio, and the partial-thromboplastin time. An examination of a peripheral-blood smear for babesia and a direct antiglobulin test were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension; normal range, \u226412 cm), as well as a central filling defect in the splenic vein that was compatible with acute splenic-vein thrombosis. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed low lung volumes, scattered ground-glass opacities, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. CT Scan of the Abdomen.A coronal reconstruction of a CT scan of the abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension), as well as a central filling defect (arrow) in the splenic vein that is compatible with acute splenic-vein thrombosis. Oral contraception was stopped. On the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s abdominal pain diminished, and she was discharged home. Four days later, severe bifrontal headache and loss of vision in the left visual field developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had decreased peripheral vision superiorly and inferiorly in the left visual field. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was scheduled, but the severity of her headaches increased, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. Additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the head and neck (Figure 2) revealed a confluent area of hypodensity and sulcal effacement involving the superior right parietal lobe that extended inferiorly into the right occipital lobe and the right aspect of the splenium of the corpus callosum (a finding suggestive of a recent infarct) and small, focal areas of hyperdensity (findings consistent with hemorrhagic conversion). Although a focal occlusive thrombus was not identified, the distal branches of the right posterior cerebral veins were not visible. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. Imaging Studies of the Head.A CT scan of the head (Panel A), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows an area of hypodensity and sulcal effacement involving the right parietal lobe that extends into the right aspect of the splenium of the corpus callosum, a finding suggestive of edema and a recent infarct. Also shown are small, focal areas of hyperdensity, findings consistent with hemorrhagic conversion. A CT venogram (Panel B), obtained in frontal projection after the administration of contrast material, shows no evidence of filling in at least one right cortical vein that drains into the superior sagittal sinus. MRI of the head was performed, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted, and gradient-echo images (Panels C, D, and E, respectively) show evidence of edema, ischemia, and hemorrhage involving the right parietal lobe. A transfemoral cerebral angiogram (Panel F), obtained in lateral projection during the venous phase after the administration of contrast material in the right internal carotid artery, shows multiple filling defects in cerebral veins (arrows), findings that indicate thrombosis of the right frontal and parietal cortical veins, with no involvement of the major dural sinuses. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported persistent headache, vision changes in the left visual field, photophobia, phonophobia, and pain with extraocular movements. She had a history of chronic back pain that was related to a vertebral disk herniation, for which she had undergone spinal-fusion surgery 4 years before admission to this hospital. During the 3 years before admission, she had had two episodes of self-limited thrombocytopenia that were thought to be associated with methotrexate treatment for an unknown skin disorder. She had no history of bleeding or clotting disorders and had had no spontaneous miscarriages. She had a 2-year history of waxing-and-waning dull epigastric pain that was associated with nausea and occasional episodes of bilious emesis; the pain partially improved with omeprazole. The patient\u2019s medications included diclofenac, baclofen, controlled-release morphine sulfate, hydrocodone\u2013acetaminophen, and omeprazole. She had taken oral contraception in the past for extended periods of time. She lived in coastal New England and worked in communications. She drank alcohol occasionally and smoked less than 1 pack of cigarettes per week; she had not smoked during the past few months. She did not use illicit drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal medications. There was no family history of bleeding or clotting disorders, spontaneous miscarriage, or hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the pulse 54 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was in mild distress because of her headache, but she was alert and oriented to time and place. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, and oral mucosa was normal. Left homonymous hemianopia was present; other cranial-nerve functions were normal, although function of the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength, sensation to light touch, and deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing showed no dysmetria. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed 0 to 2 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop and pencil cells, occasional large platelets, and normal-appearing white cells. Urinalysis showed 1+ ketones, 2+ blood, 1+ protein, 1+ urobilinogen, a specific gravity greater than 1.040 (normal range, 1.001 to 1.035), and a pH of 5 (normal range, 5 to 9) by dipstick; microscopic examination of the sediment revealed no red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of this hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. MRI of the head confirmed the infarcts and hemorrhagic conversion that had been seen on CT angiography and venography (Figure 2). A cortical vein was not visible over the lesion, which suggested either cortical-vein thrombosis or secondary compression due to mass effect of the parenchymal lesion. On the second hospital day, transfemoral cerebral angiography (Figure 2) showed multiple cerebral venous thromboses involving the right frontal and parietal cortical veins, with no involvement of the major dural sinuses.

The patient had been well until 7 years before this admission, when gray stools with mucus and streaks of blood developed. During the next year, evaluation at another hospital led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was administered. Four years before this admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. Colonoscopic examination confirmed clinically significant disease extending to the transverse colon, and histologic examination confirmed active colitis. Prednisone and mesalamine were administered, and the patient's condition improved. He declined additional immunosuppressive therapy, and prednisone was gradually tapered off. Approximately 3 years before this admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of increased stool frequency and hematochezia of 1 week's duration. He reported that he had previously decreased the dose of mesalamine and then had stopped it altogether for a total of 2 weeks because of acneiform lesions that he attributed to the drug. He then resumed taking the decreased dose of mesalamine. A tapered course of prednisone was prescribed. He declined azathioprine treatment. During the next 2.5 years, symptoms of ulcerative colitis flares recurred, for which he sporadically took delayed-release mesalamine and courses of prednisone; 6-mercaptopurine was transiently administered but was discontinued because of elevated liver-function values. He declined anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor therapy. The patient maintained a grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free diet with probiotics. He was seen intermittently at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for follow-up visits for his ulcerative colitis; laboratory test results from 5 months before this admission are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Approximately 2 months before this admission, fluctuating symptoms that were thought to be consistent with a flare of ulcerative colitis occurred, including abdominal cramping in the left lower quadrant, frequent liquid diarrhea with urgency, bloody stools, back spasms, and joint pains. The patient declined colonoscopic evaluation, but the fecal calprotectin level was elevated at 473 \u03bcg per gram of stool (normal value, \u226450). Twenty days before this admission, on follow-up evaluation at an outpatient clinic of this hospital, he reported partial symptomatic improvement with dietary changes, rest, and additional probiotics, and he noted that he was not taking other medications. He was reportedly allergic to penicillins and erythromycins. He asked about possible fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of his disease flare; he was informed that FMT was an available therapy for recurrentClostridium difficilecolitis, but efficacy in ulcerative colitis was not proved. On examination, he appeared comfortable; the weight was 67.7 kg, and the remainder of the examination, including an abdominal examination, was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. He declined colonoscopy and 5-aminosalicylic acid\u2013based medications, including enemas. Prednisone was administered. Fourteen days before this admission, the patient began taking an increased dose of prednisone because of increasing stool frequency (up to six episodes daily) and persistent hematochezia. Two days later, he had a telephone consultation, and hydrocortisone enemas were prescribed; partial improvement was noted after 5 days. Three days before this admission, he reported fevers with a peak temperature of 38.1\u00b0C, a stool frequency of four or five episodes per day, and hematochezia. On the day of this admission, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic because of persistent symptoms. He reported that he had urgent, frequent, bloody bowel movements up to 10 times daily, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, minor joint pains, left-sided abdominal pain not related to eating, weight loss of 4 kg during the preceding 3 weeks, drenching night sweats, and fever, with a peak temperature of 38.8\u00b0C the previous evening. He revealed that he had performed home FMT with stool obtained from his wife and 10-month-old child on four occasions several weeks earlier. He had a history of iron-deficiency anemia (for which iron had been administered orally and intravenously), low testosterone (for which clomiphene citrate had been administered in the past), vitamin D deficiency, anxiety, seasonal allergies, and a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (for which isoniazid had been administered in the past). Medications also included probiotics and vitamin D3. He lived with his wife and child and worked in an office. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use intravenous drugs. He had traveled to Central America and South America in the past. He was of European ancestry. There was no family history of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. On examination, the patient appeared pale and thin. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/56 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 64.0 kg, the height 180 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.8. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown inTable 1.

to this hospital because of increasing dyspnea. The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when shortness of breath developed. Approximately 3 months before admission, she began to awaken at night with chest tightness associated with fever, coughing, and dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated in the emergency department at another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed abnormalities in the lower lobe of the left lung, and a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made; oral antibiotics were administered. Increasing dyspnea and cough developed 2.5 months before admission. A fluticasone\u2013salmeterol combination inhaler and an albuterol inhaler were administered, with minimal improvement. Three weeks before admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed at the other hospital revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, prominent pulmonary arteries, and scarring in the lower lobe of the right lung. A 2-week course of prednisone was administered, with some improvement in cough and energy, with resolution of chest tightness, but with dyspnea, which occurred with minimal activity and increased at night (requiring several pillows to sleep) and occasionally at rest. Other symptoms included early satiety, decreased appetite, hoarseness, and leg swelling. She referred herself to this hospital's Women's Heart Health Program outpatient clinic because of her progressive symptoms and pericardial effusion. The patient reported cough productive of white mucus, dyspnea on exertion and when lying on her back, dry mouth for 3 months, heartburn and mild dysphagia, intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 months, and hair thinning without alopecia. She also had had symmetric pains in her knees, elbows, and metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints for approximately 3 years, which were worse in the morning and had recently improved with prednisone therapy. During the previous 14 months, she had an intentional weight loss of more than 45 kg; during the past 4.5 months, she had a weight gain of 10 kg. She had had Raynaud's phenomenon for 1.5 years, eczema since the age of 14 years, and anemia of uncertain cause. On evaluation the previous year, examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node had been benign. She had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) the previous year and herpes zoster three times in the past. Other daily medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D and iron supplements, and calcium acetate. She had taken phentermine in the past. She was allergic to penicillin, latex, and mushrooms. She was married, had children, and had lived in the midwestern and southern United States and New England. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hyperlipidemia and thyroid disease, her father was deceased, and her children were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and had a persistent cough while speaking, which worsened when she moved from a chair to the examining table. The blood pressure was 158/120 mm Hg, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 171.5 cm, the weight 91.6 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 31. The jugular veins were distended to 10 cm above the right atrium while the patient was lying in a mildly inclined position, and heart sounds were distant, without murmur, rub, or gallop. There was cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, a swollen left proximal interphalangeal joint, leg edema to the knees, a violaceous macule (1 cm by 1 cm) on the left inner thigh, and no cyanosis or clubbing; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 115 beats per minute, right-axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, Q waves in the inferior leads, low voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed. The parasternal long-axis view of the echocardiogram (Figure 1A) reveals a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion and thickening of the left ventricular walls, features consistent with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular function was within the normal range. Color Doppler imaging shows the absence of aortic-valve and mitral-valve disease. The parasternal short-axis view at the base of the heart reveals a dilated pulmonary artery and branches. Color Doppler imaging of the pulmonary valve shows mild regurgitation. M-mode imaging of the pulmonic valve (Figure 1B) shows systolic notching, also known as the \u201cflying W sign,\u201d a feature that suggests pulmonary hypertension. The parasternal short-axis view at the level of the midventricle (Figure 1C) shows flattening of the ventricular septum, also known as the \u201cD sign,\u201d a feature that suggests elevated right ventricular pressures. The apical four-chamber view (Figure 1D) shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle was hypokinetic. Color Doppler imaging reveals mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 91 mm Hg. The echocardiogram also shows no physiological evidence of tamponade and no congenital lesions that may give rise to a left-to-right shunt. (SeeVideos 1 through 4, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Echocardiographic Imaging.The parasternal long-axis view shows a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion (Panel A, arrow) and thickened left ventricular (LV) walls, features suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy. An M-mode tracing of the posterior pulmonary valve leaflet in the parasternal short-axis view at the base of the heart (Panel B) shows systolic notching (arrow), known as the \u201cflying W sign,\u201d which indicates pulmonary hypertension. In the parasternal short-axis view at the midventricular level (Panel C), interventricular septal flattening (arrow) during systole, known as the \u201cD sign,\u201d is a finding consistent with increased pressure in the right ventricle (RV); pericardial effusion is also evident (arrowhead). The apical four-chamber view (Panel D) shows an enlarged right atrium (RA) and right ventricle relative to the left heart chambers. LA denotes left atrium. The patient was transferred from the clinic to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 201/147 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was able to speak in complete sentences. The complete blood count showed a red-cell distribution width of 18.1% (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5) and was otherwise normal; the peripheral-blood smear revealed 2+ anisocytosis and hypochromasia; the white-cell differential count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of tests of coagulation and liver function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, thyrotropin, troponin T, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate; testing for troponin I, rheumatoid factor, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and trace protein by dipstick and 0 to 2 red cells and few bacteria per high-power field and was otherwise normal; urine pregnancy testing was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional imaging studies were performed. Laboratory Data. The chest radiograph shows enlargement of the right, left, and main pulmonary arteries (Figure 2A). A CT scan of the chest and a subsequent pulmonary CT angiogram confirm enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and no evidence of pulmonary emboli. The right ventricle is enlarged; the wall of the right ventricle is thick (5 mm), with flattening of the interventricular septum. The right atrium is dilated, and there is reflux of intravenous contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A small pericardial effusion is present. There is bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear, with no evidence of interstitial lung disease or emphysema. The airways appear normal (Figure 2B, 2C, and 2D). A ventilation\u2013perfusion lung scan was normal. Thoracic Imaging.A chest radiograph (Panel A) shows enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and of the right and left pulmonary arteries. There is peripheral pruning of the pulmonary vessels, with enlargement of the right atrium. An axial image from a pulmonary CT angiogram (CTA) confirms enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, which measures 3.8 cm just proximal to its bifurcation (Panel B). In another axial image from the CTA, hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall, flattening of the interventricular septum, and right atrial enlargement (Panel C) are seen. A coronal image from the CTA (Panel D) shows reflux of contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins (black arrow), with a small pericardial effusion (arrowhead); multiple enlarged left axillary lymph nodes are present (white arrow). There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. During the patient's first 3 days in the hospital, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and furosemide were administered; systolic blood pressures decreased to between 120 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg. On the third hospital day, diagnostic right heart catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, with elevated right atrial pressure and markedly reduced cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation, features indicating right ventricular failure (Table 2).

The Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel \u03b11 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls. The patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal. Two weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed minimally displaced fractures at the base of the second metatarsal and the cuboid, as well as diffuse bone demineralization. Radiographs of the Left Foot.A radiograph obtained 5 days before this admission (Panel A) shows diffuse bone demineralization and lucent lines at the base of the second metatarsal (arrow) and the cuboid (not shown) that were consistent with fractures. A repeat radiograph obtained on admission (Panel B) shows new fractures of the proximal first metatarsal (black arrow) and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (white arrows); a new crescentic osseous fragment (arrowhead) is thought to be an avulsed bone fragment. A radiograph obtained on hospital day 7 (Panel C) shows multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal (black arrow) and the medial navicular bone (white arrow); progression of bone edema is also noted. A walking cast was placed, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission. The patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2). Clinical Photographs.On admission, the gingivae were erythematous with bleeding (Panel A). After removal of the cast, edema and bruising of the left foot are seen (Panel B). On hospital day 8, nontender, purpuric macules are present on the fingers and hands (Panel C), as well as the arms and toes. The results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus,Bordetella pertussis,B. parapertussis,Chlamydia pneumoniae, andMycoplasma pneumoniaewas negative. Stool testing forClostridium difficileantigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone. A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, thed-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures.", "true_dx": "Multiple vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency.", "pred_dx": "Acute leukemia (likely acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia)", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "<|im_start|>assistant", "t": 3, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's tackle this case.", "t": 0, "c": "1", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The patient is an 18-year-old with Dravet syndrome, which I know is associated with SCN1A mutations.", "t": 1, "c": "11", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He has a history of developmental delay and seizures.", "t": 5, "c": "6", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The main issues here are the foot problems and the new symptoms like increased seizures, fever, bleeding, and lab abnormalities.", "t": 5, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "First, looking at the foot: initial MRI showed bone marrow edema, then fractures on X-ray, and progression to more fractures and cortical erosions.", "t": 1, "c": "17", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The fractures without significant trauma make me think of something causing bone weakness.", "t": 2, "c": "4", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Since he has Dravet syndrome, maybe a complication related to that?
