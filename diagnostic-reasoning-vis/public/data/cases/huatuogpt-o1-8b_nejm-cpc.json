[{"id": "ec6731a6f3265c552fc9ad26d3d2345d", "qid": 260, "prompt": "A 31-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustular rash. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admission, when he noticed several itchy white \u201cbumps\u201d around the anus that subsequently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicillin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started. During the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation. Additional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of southeastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, with raised borders (Figure 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In addition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicular lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diameter, were filled with clear fluid, and had surrounding erythema (Figure 2A and 2B). Photographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission.Panel A shows a tender perianal ulcer, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. Panel B shows an ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that is similar in appearance to the perianal ulcer. Panel C shows that the ulcer has heaped margins around a central dry base. In all panels, the patient\u2019s hands are shown. Photographs of the Rash.Panels A and B show scattered papulovesicular lesions on the chest that were present 2 days before admission. The lesions measure 2 mm in diameter, are filled with clear fluid, and have surrounding erythema. Panel C shows a lesion on the right palm that was present at the time of admission. Panel D shows a papulovesicular lesion on the left second finger, which was one of the last skin lesions to develop, approximately 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens forNeisseria gonorrhoeaeandChlamydia trachomatisnucleic acids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started. During the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions appeared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis (Figure 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital. Photograph from Anoscopic Examination.A photograph obtained during anoscopy, performed on the day of admission, shows intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm (Figure 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were administered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.

The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when sore throat, subjective fever, malaise, and diffuse myalgias developed. On evaluation by his primary care physician on the second day of illness, a clinical diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis was made, and a 7-day course of oral penicillin was prescribed. Three days later, the patient was seen in an urgent care clinic because of fatigue and worsening myalgias. He reported that the sore throat and fever had improved. A rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus was negative, and the patient returned home. Fifteen days later, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic with persistent myalgias and malaise and a 5-day history of increased sore throat and fever. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was positive, and a blood culture was negative. Oral levofloxacin was prescribed, and the patient returned home. Four days later, shortness of breath and pain on the left side of the chest developed. The patient returned to his primary care physician. The chest pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), increased with deep inspiration and radiated to the left shoulder and back. The sore throat had improved, but fever, myalgias, and malaise persisted. The patient appeared ill. The white-cell count was 23,800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4700 to 10,800), the C-reactive protein level was 29.5 mg per deciliter (reference value, <0.8), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 96 mm per hour (reference value, <15), and a blood culture was obtained. The next day, the patient was admitted to a hospital near his home. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, and tachycardia was present. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck and a transthoracic echocardiogram were reportedly normal. Oral azithromycin and intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and hydromorphone hydrochloride were administered. The patient\u2019s pain improved somewhat, but fever and shortness of breath persisted. On the third hospital day, CT of the chest reportedly revealed right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, small bilateral pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and no evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. A test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Antibodies indicative of past infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus were detected. Over the next 2 days, abdominal pain developed. On the fifth hospital day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed; no abnormalities were noted in the abdomen or pelvis, but moderate bilateral pleural effusions, dependent bibasilar opacities, and a moderate pericardial effusion were seen in the visualized portion of the lower thorax. A transesophageal echocardiogram that was obtained the next day showed a small circumferential pericardial effusion with some fibrinous strands; no vegetations were seen, and the estimated ejection fraction was 65%. A tuberculin skin test was negative. Indomethacin and colchicine were administered orally. Swelling of the shoulders and elbows, stiffness of the shoulders, and a faint erythematous rash on the face, neck, and arms developed. Fever (with temperatures between 38.9\u00b0C and 39.4\u00b0C) and myalgias persisted, and dyspnea progressively increased. The administration of intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen (through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute) was begun. An antistreptolysin O titer was 289 IU per milliliter (reference value, <530). On the 11th hospital day, a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large anterior pericardial effusion and a moderate posterior pericardial effusion, as well as marked respiratory variation of tricuspid inflow. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit at this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pain on the left side of the chest and in the left shoulder, dyspnea, diffuse myalgias, anorexia, and loose stools. His parents also reported that he had had jerking movements during sleep over the past 2 days. The patient was a college student and lived with roommates. He was sexually active and consistently used condoms. He had had no exposure to animals and had not traveled outside New England during the previous 4 years. He did not use tobacco, but he smoked marijuana approximately two times per month and drank five or six beers once per week. He had no known allergies. His brother had recently died at 32 years of age from intravenous-drug use that was complicated by fungal endocarditis with an abscess of the mitral-valve ring. On examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. The temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/83 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 14 mm Hg. The heart sounds were distant. The jugular venous pressure was greater than 19 cm of water, and Kussmaul\u2019s sign (distention of the jugular veins during inspiration) was present. There was dullness on percussion at both lung bases, and Ewart\u2019s sign (dullness inferior to the left scapula, with bronchial breath sounds and bronchophony) was present. There was pitting edema of the legs below the knees and mild swelling around the shoulders and elbows, without effusions. There were faint pink macules on the forearms and the right antecubital fossa (Figure 1) that were no longer visible after 1 hour. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, amylase, and lipase. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The results of urinalysis were normal. A blood culture, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were obtained. Clinical Photograph.A faint pink macular rash developed on the patient\u2019s forearms that was no longer visible 1 hour later. (Photograph courtesy of Dr. Jeffrey Gelfand.) Laboratory Data. An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2A), obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed that the cardiac silhouette was symmetrically enlarged and had an appearance that was consistent with the water-bottle sign (in which the rounded and enlarged cardiac silhouette on frontal chest radiography mimics the appearance of an old-fashioned water bottle); this finding is classically associated with pericardial effusion. There were no signs of specific cardiac-chamber enlargement, although cardiac dilatation could also cause the symmetrically enlarged cardiac silhouette. The presence of cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature, indistinct vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing was consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There was blunting of the costophrenic angles and opacification of the lower lung zones bilaterally; these findings are consistent with bilateral small pleural effusions (larger on the left side than on the right) and associated atelectasis. Imaging and Cardiology Studies of the Chest.An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Panel A), obtained with the patient in an upright position, shows that the cardiac silhouette is symmetrically enlarged; this finding is consistent with the water-bottle sign, which is classically associated with pericardial effusion. The presence of cephalization of pulmonary vasculature, indistinct vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing is consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles and opacification of the lower lung zones bilaterally; these findings are consistent with bilateral small pleural effusions (larger on the left side than on the right) and associated atelectasis. An electrocardiogram (Panel B) shows PR-segment elevation in lead aVR, subtle PR-segment depression in leads I and II, and T-wave inversions in the mid-precordium. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Panel C) shows a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion (asterisks), with right atrial inversion during early atrial diastole (arrow). LA denotes left atrium, LV left ventricle, RA right atrium, and RV right ventricle. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2B) that was obtained on admission showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 87 beats per minute, PR-segment elevation in lead aVR, subtle PR-segment depression in leads I and II, submillimeter elevation of the J point (the junction between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment) in the lateral leads, and minor mid-precordial T-wave inversions. Ischemic ST-segment changes, PR-segment elongation, concave ST-segment elevations, low QRS voltage, and electrical alternans were absent, but there was minor respiratory variation in QRS voltage. These findings, particularly the resolving PR-segment changes and the first appearance of a minor T-wave inversion, could be consistent with a stage III pericarditic process that had been developing for several weeks.1 A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2C) showed normal biventricular function and chamber size, only trace tricuspid regurgitation, and no other valvular abnormalities. Circumferential pericardial effusion was seen, with maximum diastolic dimensions of 3.6 cm posterior to the right atrium, 2.5 cm at the lateral wall of the left ventricle, and 2.0 cm anteriorly. Fibrin strands were attached to the visceral pericardium, but this layer did not appear thickened or have parallel motion with the parietal pericardial layer on M-mode tracings (a finding that would have suggested constriction). Bilateral pleural effusions were present. The inferior vena cava measured 2.3 cm in diameter and did not collapse with inspiration, and there were exaggerated respirophasic variations in the transtricuspid and transmitral flow velocities that were suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure. Right atrial inversion and intermittent, transient, late diastolic inversion of the right ventricular free wall were seen. These findings are consistent with hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion.", "true_dx": "Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease.", "pred_dx": "Post-viral pericarditis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a young guy who started off with symptoms like fever, sore throat, and muscle pains.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's pretty common, so it could be anything from a viral infection to something more serious like strep throat.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But then things get interesting.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "After a few weeks, he's still feeling unwell, and now he's got chest pain and trouble breathing.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This isn't just a simple cold or flu anymore.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The chest pain is really telling.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's sharp and gets worse when he takes a deep breath, and it even radiates to his shoulder and back.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's classic for pericarditis, where the lining around the heart gets inflamed.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And look at those lab results\u2014his white cell count is way up, CRP is sky-high, and the ESR is off the charts.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "All signs pointing towards inflammation.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, there's more.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's got a rash that comes and goes, and it's not just any rash\u2014it's a pink macule that disappears quickly.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a bit unusual.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, he's got pleural effusions, which means fluid in the space around his lungs, and his heart looks big on the X-ray, like a 'water bottle' shape.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's another clue for pericardial effusion.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, let's consider what else it could be.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Viral infections can definitely cause pericarditis, especially after a sore throat.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And the timing fits\u2014he had that sore throat a few weeks ago.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, it seems like we're dealing with post-infectious pericarditis.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But hold on, there's more to consider.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's got some weird stuff happening too, like his jugular veins are distended, and there's a sign called Kussmaul's sign.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's usually seen in constrictive pericarditis, where the pericardium becomes thick and rigid.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But his echo doesn't show that\u2014the pericardium isn't thickened, and the heart chambers aren't restricted.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, it's not constrictive pericarditis.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 25, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, what about Dressler's syndrome?

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 days before this admission, when burning epigastric pain developed after she ate a meal. Nausea and vomiting occurred 1 hour later; there was no diarrhea. After the pain persisted for 8 hours, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/94 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The abdomen was soft but distended; there was diffuse mild tenderness on palpation, without rebound or guarding. The white-cell count was 12,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the blood lipase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement. The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of possible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hospital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Figure 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction. Imaging Studies.An axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo MRI of the abdomen (Panel A) shows bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement (arrows). An axial non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT image of the chest (Panel B) shows irregular cysts in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospital day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was continued. On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid parenchymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the thyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diameter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast. On the eighth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed. The airways were inspected to the segmental level, and no abnormalities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (reference range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative. On the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eosinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, including mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further care. On arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the context of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she attributed to smoking. Her surgical history included cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months before this presentation had been normal; the patient had not undergone mammography or colonoscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had immigrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until she was 3 years of age, when she began to have recurrent falls, difficulty walking, and seizures. A diagnostic evaluation at another hospital included a muscle biopsy, electroencephalography, and electroretinography, as well as analysis of the carnitine profile, visual-evoked potentials, and the enzymatic activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; the test results were reportedly interpreted as inconclusive. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed; T2-weighted images reportedly showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Therapy with carbamazepine and a multivitamin was initiated. During the next 15 years, progressive stepwise deterioration, including worsening dystonia and dysarthria, occurred; cognitive function was not affected. Exacerbations of her neurologic decline were precipitated by acute intercurrent illnesses and recurrent seizures from which she did not have complete recovery. Five years before the current presentation, anticonvulsant medications were stopped for 1 month. During that period, three flurries of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures occurred. During admission to a second hospital, the complete blood count, oxygen saturation, blood levels of calcium and magnesium, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Medications on discharge included carbamazepine,l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin B complex. On follow-up at that hospital 2 months later, the patient reportedly had dysarthria, dystonic posturing of both arms (especially the hands), and an ataxic gait. Strength was 3+/5 in the distal arms and 5/5 in the proximal arms. Approximately 2.8 years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated at a third hospital. MRI of the head was performed; T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images again showed areas of abnormal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia bilaterally, with mild associated volume loss. The MRI was significantly degraded by susceptibility artifacts that were produced by orthodontic braces. The blood lactate level was 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [4.5 to 19.8 mg per deciliter]), and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate level was 1.2 mmol per liter (10.8 mg per deciliter; reference range at this hospital, 0.6 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5.4 to 19.8 mg per deciliter]). A preliminary diagnosis of mitochondrial cytopathy was made. Between 17 and 11 months before the current presentation, examinations were performed at the second hospital while the patient was receiving levetiracetam and trihexyphenidyl. Speech difficulties, limb rigidity, and spasticity of the left upper leg were noted. She was referred to the epilepsy clinic of this hospital. On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported dysarthric speech and painful dystonia of her hands and limbs (particularly her legs). The dystonia was associated with gait deterioration that had led to use of a wheelchair. Cognitive function was not affected. Her most recent seizure had occurred 1 year before this assessment. The patient was the fourth child of healthy consanguineous parents (first cousins). She had been born after a full-term gestation, with no complications. Her birth weight was 3750 g. Medications were levetiracetam, pyridoxine, thiamine, and trihexyphenidyl. She had no known allergies. She lived with her family in the Arabian Peninsula; she spoke Arabic and some English, attended a regular high school, and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. She had three older brothers who were healthy. She had a 6-year-old sister with a similar illness that had started when she was 3 years of age, when she had an episode of bloody diarrhea and then began to have dystonia of the right foot, difficulty walking, and seizures. On evaluation at that time, the sister had a peak blood lactate level of 11.7 mmol per liter (105.4 mg per deciliter) and a peak CSF lactate level of 2.3 mmol per liter (20.7 mg per deciliter). Genetic testing for the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) and the Leigh syndrome was reportedly negative, and levels of urinary organic acids were normal. The sister underwent MRI of the head during the acute phase of her disease. T2-weighted images showed nonenhancing areas of abnormal, diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalami, midbrain, and cerebellum. Repeat imaging studies obtained 10 months later showed resolution of most of the signal abnormalities, although residual signal abnormalities and volume loss were present in the basal ganglia. On examination at this hospital, which was performed with the assistance of an interpreter, the patient was alert and her mental status was normal. She had severe dysarthria, but her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. Cranial-nerve function was intact, and visual acuity was 20/30 in both eyes. She had fluctuating dystonia of the hands, arms, legs, and feet that was more prominent on the left side than on the right side. Strength was normal throughout. The plantar reflex was extensor in the left foot and was mute in the right foot; deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The gait was slow, wide-based, and dystonic, with inversion and internal rotation of both feet. The remainder of the examination was normal. MRI of the head was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted images showed persistent areas of abnormal hyperintensity, volume loss, and subtle abnormal mineralization in the basal ganglia bilaterally. Electroencephalography, which was performed while the patient was awake and while she was asleep, revealed excessive, diffuse beta activity, with no definitive evidence of epileptiform abnormalities. The younger sister was present during the clinic visit and was also examined. She had mild dystonia of the right foot, an extensor plantar reflex in the right foot, and a clumsy gait. The patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic of this hospital (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). She came to the visit in a wheelchair. Her speech was dysarthric in both English and Arabic. She had previously been a fluent Arabic speaker. While the patient was sitting quietly, she had dystonic posturing of the left hand and both feet. During any activation procedure, the dystonic posturing of the left hand and left foot increased. During rapid successive movements, slowness and dystonic posturing were more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. There was no rigidity of the arms or legs. When she walked, dystonic posturing was more prominent in the left hand and foot than in the right hand and foot. A pull test revealed good postural stability.

The patient had been in his usual state of health when he was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for a preoperative evaluation of chronic kidney disease, before a transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. Eighteen years before this evaluation, an elevated creatinine level had been found incidentally during an evaluation of fatigue, malaise, and joint stiffness. The patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of another hospital, and biopsy of the right kidney was performed. Pathological examination of the kidney-biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed glomeruli with thickened capillary walls and mild mesangial hypercellularity. A Jones\u2019 silver stain showed \u201cspikes\u201d and \u201cbubbles\u201d in the glomerular basement membrane, features typical of membranous nephropathy. The interstitium had an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils, with tubulitis and without granulomas or neutrophils. Immunofluorescence showed staining of granular deposits for IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium. Other stains (C1q, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and albumin) were negative. Electron microscopy showed widespread amorphous subepithelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium, with surrounding spikes and podocyte foot-process effacement. Arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis were also present. At the other hospital, these findings were interpreted as membranous nephropathy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with eosinophils, and arterionephrosclerosis with global glomerulosclerosis. Kidney-Biopsy Specimen.Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panels A and B) shows glomeruli with thickened capillary walls (Panel A, arrows) and mesangial hypercellularity. There is an interstitial infiltrate of eosinophils (Panel B, arrow) and plasma cells (Panel B, oval). Immunofluorescence (Panel C) shows staining of granular deposits for IgG along the glomerular capillary wall (arrows) and in the mesangium (asterisk). Electron microscopy of a glomerulus (Panel D) shows amorphous subepithelial deposits (arrows) with adjacent spikes in the glomerular basement membrane (arrowheads) and in the mesangium (asterisk); these findings are typical of membranous nephropathy. The patient was told that his kidney disease was consistent with a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Prednisone was administered for 6 months and then tapered to a lower dose. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate and furosemide was initiated, as was treatment with losartan, although losartan was intermittently stopped because of hyperkalemia; prednisone was continued. During the next 18 years, the creatinine level gradually increased to 3.28 mg per deciliter (290 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.70 to 1.18 mg per deciliter [62 to 104 \u03bcmol per liter]). Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis complicated by diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. One year later, painless enlargement of the right lacrimal gland occurred. Surgical excision of the right lacrimal gland was performed at the other hospital, and examination of the excised specimen reportedly revealed nonspecific inflammation. The next year, enlargement of the left lacrimal gland and the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands developed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed masslike abnormalities of the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. The abnormalities were hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. The patient declined another glandular biopsy and was told that he probably had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Glandular enlargement resolved, and during the next 23 years, the patient was treated with prednisone for presumptive Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Two years before the current evaluation, shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure on exertion developed; these symptoms usually resolved after approximately 20 minutes of rest. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and aortic stenosis was diagnosed. Four months before the current evaluation, the shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure worsened, such that the patient became unable to carry his groceries a short distance to his house. Additional imaging and cardiology studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the heart, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple large aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with associated mural thrombus (Figure 2A through 2D; andVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was extensive coronary-artery calcification, along with scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, multiple mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and calcification in the tail of the pancreas. Cardiac CT Scans and Coronary Angiography.Curved, multiplanar, reformatted CT images of the left anterior descending artery (Panel A), left circumflex artery (Panel B), and right coronary artery (Panel C) show aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with mural thrombus (white asterisks) adjacent to contrast-enhanced coronary arteries (white arrowheads). There is extensive coronary-artery calcification. A three-dimensional volume-rendered CT image of the heart (Panel D) shows aneurysms involving the left main artery (black arrowhead), left anterior descending artery (white arrowhead), left circumflex artery (white arrow), and right coronary artery (black arrow), with the contrast-enhanced lumen depicted in red and adjacent mural thrombus depicted in yellow. Coronary angiographic images of the left coronary artery obtained in the right anterior oblique cranial view (Panels E and F) and right anterior oblique caudal view (Panel G) show massive aneurysms involving the left main artery (white arrowheads), proximal and middle left anterior descending artery (white arrows), and proximal left circumflex artery (black arrows), as compared with normal segments of the coronary arteries (black arrowheads). Coronary angiography of the right coronary artery obtained in the left anterior oblique cranial view (Panel H) also shows aneurysms in the proximal and middle segments (white arrowhead), as compared with normal segments of the coronary artery (black arrowhead). Echocardiography showed severe tricuspid aortic stenosis, with bulky calcification of the aortic-valve leaflets with restricted motion (Video 2, available at NEJM.org), as well as severe calcification of the aortic root at the sinotubular junction. Coronary angiography revealed large aneurysms with partial calcification involving all the coronary arteries \u2014 specifically, the distal left main, proximal and middle left anterior descending, proximal left circumflex, and proximal and middle right coronary arteries \u2014 and calcified narrowing between the aneurysmal segments (Figure 2E through 2H). The distal lumens were normal in caliber and were not well visualized because of the slow flow through the proximal aneurysmal segments. There was moderate, diffuse disease in the middle left circumflex artery. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed 3 months before the current evaluation, and a subsequent TAVR was planned. During the current evaluation, the patient indicated that the shortness of breath and chest pressure on exertion had abated since the balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Additional history was obtained. The patient had chronic back and neck pain due to severe kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis, and cervical myelopathy; the pain had been treated 2 months earlier with anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion. He had hypertension, anemia, gout, osteopenia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included prednisone, metoprolol, aspirin, rosuvastatin, furosemide, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, epoetin alfa, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, pancrelipase, alfuzosin, allopurinol, and gabapentin. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 6 years but had stopped four decades earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. The patient had been retired from his career as a health care professional for 2 years. He was married and lived in a house in a suburban area of New England. His father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died of prostate cancer at 67 years of age, his mother had had pancreatic cancer and had died at 65 years of age, and his younger brother had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died after a myocardial infarction at 46 years of age. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.8. There was a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur that was heard best at the right upper sternal border. The creatinine level was 3.41 mg per deciliter (301 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), which was similar to other levels obtained during the previous 1.5 years. The urinary protein level was 149.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 13.5); the ratio of total protein to creatinine was 2.23 (reference range, <0.15). Results of liver-function tests were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Four years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have anhedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cognitive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started. Fourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensities involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home. During the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed as 5\u2212/5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of postconcussive syndrome was considered, and treatment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricular distribution on T2-weighted imaging, without associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Results of electroencephalography were normal, as were results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later. Over the next 6-week period, during sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilaterally on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast enhancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were concerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up with the psychiatric service was recommended. Five weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped participating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months. Other medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medications included amlodipine, buspirone, bupropion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke. On examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength in both legs was assessed as 5/5. She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-function tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyrotropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human immunodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit. While the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextroamphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground. On hospital day 11, the patient reported being unable to use her left arm because of weakness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neurology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation center. At the rehabilitation center, the patient received physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and grooming but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or location. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was flattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in response to tactile stimulation. The white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.

The patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fever with a peak temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, fatigue, headache, and mild sore throat developed. Two days after the onset of fever, he came to the medical walk-in clinic at this hospital because of persistent symptoms. He also had atopic dermatitis, which had been treated intermittently with topical glucocorticoids. He had taken aspirin and acetaminophen for the fever, with transient improvement. The patient had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 6 months earlier. He worked in an office and traveled frequently to Europe. Two days before the onset of fever, he had returned from a 3-week trip to Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, during which he had gone mountain biking and hiking. He had not noted any insect bites. He drank alcohol infrequently, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and reported sexual activity only with his wife, who was pregnant. On examination, the vital signs were normal. There were tender lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region; the largest was on the right side and measured 1 cm in diameter. A rapid antigen-detection test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and a throat specimen was obtained for culture. A presumptive diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was made. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic because of fever with a peak temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, diaphoresis, and mild headache; he did not have neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, or gastrointestinal symptoms, and his sore throat had resolved. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/79 mm Hg, and the pulse 102 beats per minute. The conjunctivae were pale and anicteric, and he had mild nasal congestion, a mobile left axillary lymph node (1 cm in diameter) that was not tender, and bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy with supple, small lymph nodes. There were multiple pigmented macules on his trunk that reportedly had been present for decades. The throat culture taken 2 days earlier was negative for group A streptococcus. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, and total bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with 2+ albumin, 1+ blood, and 0 to 2 white cells and red cells per high-power field. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumonia (Figure 1). Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior (Panel A) and lateral (Panel B) radiographs of the chest, obtained 4 days after the onset of symptoms, show a faint, patchy opacity in the left lower lobe that may represent pneumonia. After blood cultures were obtained and the administration of doxycycline was begun, the patient returned home. The next evening (5 days after the onset of symptoms), he came to the emergency department at this hospital because of fever with a peak temperature of 40.0\u00b0C and a new rash on his torso that had appeared after the third dose of doxycycline. He reported decreased appetite and had stopped taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen because of gastrointestinal discomfort. He reported having received all recommended childhood vaccinations. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/83 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Bilateral anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was present, as were multiple faint, nonpruritic macules on his upper chest, abdomen, and back. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The administration of doxycycline was stopped, levofloxacin was begun, and acetaminophen was continued. Overnight, during a febrile episode, the patient's oxygen saturation decreased to 93% while he was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered. The next day, the temperature rose to 39.7\u00b0C. Levofloxacin was discontinued because of the persistent fever, and the administration of ceftriaxone and azithromycin was initiated. Albuterol was given by nebulizer, and the acetaminophen was alternated with ibuprofen. After 25 hours in the observation unit (6 days after the onset of symptoms), the patient was admitted to this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was a faint, small maculopapular rash on the chest, abdomen, and back; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures obtained 2 days earlier remained without growth. Red papules developed on the patient's forehead and face on the second hospital day and later spread to his arms; the rash was associated with a prickly sensation. The maximum temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A repeat chest radiograph showed that the patchy left basilar opacity had decreased in size from the previous study. The patient received prophylaxis with enoxaparin. The administration of doxycycline was restarted, azithromycin was stopped, and fexofenadine was begun. During the next 2 days, the patient's fever resolved and he felt better. On examination, a few petechiae were noted in the oropharynx. There was a diffuse rash with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules (1 to 3 mm in diameter) on the face, trunk, arms, legs, hands, and feet but not on the palms or soles (Figure 2). Rash.Seven days after the onset of the patient's symptoms, a diffuse rash developed, with monomorphic, smooth, nonscaly, dome-shaped, reddish-pink papules that were 1 to 3 mm in diameter.

The patient had been well until 6 days before admission, when fatigue and malaise developed. The next day, he had multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting, accompanied by abdominal distention and diffuse abdominal pain. He felt feverish, but his temperature was 35.5\u00b0C. He took an unknown nonprescription medication for pain and one dose of ciprofloxacin that was provided by a family member. Three days before admission, his family noted yellowing of the skin and eyes and brought him to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/81 mm Hg, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and had no asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, the sclerae were icteric, and the abdomen was protuberant and not tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of acetaminophen was less than 3 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 25), and tests for hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, hepatitis B virus (HBV) core IgM antibodies, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An interferon-gamma release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas performed, and an abdominal ultrasound was obtained. Laboratory Data. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a patent portal vein and coarse and heterogeneous echotexture of the liver, with no focal lesions. The gallbladder was contracted, with a thickened wall and biliary sludge (Figure 1); there were no gallstones, and testing for a sonographic Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. The renal parenchyma was echogenic in both kidneys. Ultrasonography of the Abdomen.An ultrasound image of the liver shows coarsening of the echotexture (Panel A). An image of the gallbladder reveals gallbladder-wall thickening (Panel B, arrow). The gallbladder is not distended. No gallstones or sludge are present. Apparent internal echoes in the gallbladder lumen are artifactual. N-acetylcysteine was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Nausea and intermittent vomiting persisted; a nonproductive cough developed, but the patient remained afebrile. The oxygen saturation, as measured by means of a pulse oximeter placed on the finger, was intermittently as low as 85%, and supplemental oxygen, adjusted to a rate of 2 to 4 liters per minute to ensure adequate oxygenation, was administered through a nasal cannula. On the second hospital day, computed tomography of the chest, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material to assess for the presence of a pulmonary embolism, showed trace pleural effusion in the right lung and dependent atelectasis in both lungs, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. The arterial oxygen saturation, as measured by arterial blood gas testing, was greater than 99%, despite low peripheral oxygen saturation levels measured by a pulse oximeter on the finger. On the third hospital day, acute kidney injury developed, the degree of anemia worsened, and the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis, burr cells, spur cells, very few schistocytes, nucleated red cells, and polymorphonuclear cells with toxic granulation. A direct antiglobulin test was negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, and the patient was transferred by ambulance to the medical intensive care unit of this hospital. On admission, the patient reported occasional dark stools and mild, diffuse abdominal pain exacerbated by deep breaths. He had hyperlipidemia, and 7 months before admission he had taken an unknown cholesterol-lowering medication for a period of 2 months. He currently took no medications, herbal supplements, or Ayurvedic therapies. He last drank alcohol 6 months before admission, but he previously drank in a binge pattern, consuming 8 to 10 alcoholic drinks at a time, several days per month. He resided in a rural community in northern India, worked as a horticulturalist, and had cattle on his property. Two weeks before admission, he had traveled to New England to visit his pregnant daughter. Before traveling, he had attended several weddings in northern India, where the meals were shared among the guests, but he had had no known contact with persons who were ill. The patient\u2019s father had reportedly died of an unspecified form of liver disease in his sixth decade of life. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He was alert and oriented and had no dysarthria or asterixis. The skin was jaundiced, and the sclerae were icteric. The skin was without spider angiomas or palmar erythema. The first and second heart sounds were normal and without murmurs, and the jugular venous pulsation was not distended. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and mildly distended, with minimally diffuse tenderness to palpation. The liver edge was palpable and nontender, with no splenomegaly. There was no edema in his arms or legs. Rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Urinalysis showed 2+ glucose, 2+ bilirubin, 2+ blood, 2+ protein, a specific gravity of 1.010 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), and a pH of 7 (reference range, 5 to 9). In a random urine sample, the urinary sodium level was 67 mmol per liter, and the urinary creatinine level was 36 mg per deciliter. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed after the administration of gadolinium showed mild changes suggestive of diffuse hepatic steatosis, a contracted gallbladder with gallbladder-wall edema, and fluid and fat stranding surrounding the second and third portions of the duodenum; the portal vein was not well visualized (Figure 2). Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Abdomen.Magnetic resonance imaging was performed after the administration of gadolinium. A T2-weighted image reveals changes suggestive of periportal edema (arrows).

The patient was born at another hospital by vaginal delivery after induction of labor at 38 weeks' gestation because of oligohydramnios. The mother had received prenatal care, including obstetrical ultrasonographic testing, the results of which were reportedly normal. Serologic screening tests during pregnancy were reportedly negative. The prenatal course was uncomplicated. The mother took ondansetron for nausea and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and reported that there had been less fetal movement in utero as compared with her previous pregnancy. No meconium was present at delivery. The birth weight was 3.0 kg (25th percentile), the length 48.3 cm (25th percentile), and the head circumference 32.5 cm (10th percentile); the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal nursery. The results of newborn auditory screening were reportedly normal. Tests performed at the New England Newborn Screening Program were negative. She was discharged home on the third day of life. She reportedly fed well and developed and grew normally. She smiled, laughed, and interacted socially, but she vocalized little. At approximately 4 months of age, the infant's parents noted that she startled in response to loud sounds. At 6 months of age, she began rolling over from her stomach to her back and vice versa, reaching out for objects, and sitting with assistance. Her length was 69.9 cm (96th percentile), her head circumference 43 cm (72nd percentile), and her weight 8.5 kg (89th percentile). By 9 months, she could grasp objects and feed herself; however, her pediatrician noted that she sat only in the tripod position (back bent slightly forward, and arms placed forward with the hands near the feet). Two months later, her parents reported that she sat only briefly and then flopped over and that she had stopped reaching for objects and feeding herself. At age 11.5 months, she was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at this hospital. The infant's parents reported that she often appeared tired and less alert than she had earlier in her life. She did not crawl or pull to stand. She consumed dairy-based infant formula and soft baby foods and had maintained expected trajectories on the developmental curves for height, weight, and head circumference. She smiled, made good eye contact, and responded to her name. She drooled frequently and made occasional mouthing movements. She did not choke or have trouble swallowing, she did not have constipation, and she did not have activity suggestive of seizures. She had had an ear infection at 4 months of age. Immunizations were current. She lived with her parents and her brother (3.5 years of age), who were well. Her mother was of Russian Jewish ancestry and her father of Irish and Italian ancestry. Her mother was gravida 4, para 2, spontaneous abortion 2. The family had traveled to the Caribbean and Italy. A paternal cousin had a mild speech problem; there were no other known neurologic conditions in the family. On examination, the infant's facial features were nondysmorphic. The head circumference was 45 cm (50th percentile); the anterior fontanel was soft. Funduscopic examination was unsuccessful. There were two hypopigmented spots on her left thigh; examination with a Wood's lamp was negative, revealing no evidence of neurocutaneous lesions. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. On neurologic examination, she was subdued, appeared alert, and intermittently startled spontaneously. Pupillary reactions were normal, and ocular movements were full and conjugate, with horizontal and vertical eye movements that tracked the examiner's face, bright objects, and light, without saccadic intrusions or nystagmus. Movements of the infant's face and palate were symmetric. There were no tongue fasciculations or macroglossia. She smiled periodically, made brief chewing movements, puckered her lips, and drooled, but she did not vocalize. She turned her head to a bell ring. She opened her hands and moved her fingers. Her legs were extended tonically, with bilateral equinus foot posture (plantar flexion) and curled toes. When pulled to a standing position, she rose onto her toes. Muscle tone was increased, with rigidity; the heel cords were tight. The plantar reflexes were extensor; grasp and Moro reflexes were absent. A few unsustained beats of ankle clonus were present. In the prone position, she lifted her head briefly. Her head and neck drooped anteriorly when sitting. The asymmetric tonic neck reflex was incomplete. On testing of the parachute reflex (abduction of arms, extension of elbows and wrists, and spreading of fingers, elicited when an infant is held in suspension in the ventral position and is tilted abruptly forward toward the floor), she fisted both hands and did not spread her arms. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 159 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80). Other test results, including blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase, were normal, as were a complete panel of plasma amino acids and urinary levels of organic acids. An electroencephalogram showed the absence of sleep spindles during a relatively prolonged stage N2 sleep (a stage of non\u2013rapid-eye-movement sleep characterized by sleep spindles), infrequent low-amplitude spikes in both centroparietal regions during sleep stage N2 (of uncertain clinical significance), and no electrographic or electroclinical features of seizures. Seven days after initial evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed without the administration of gadolinium (Figure 1). The image showed mild diffuse hypomyelination that was most conspicuous in the deep and subcortical supratentorial white matter, with relative sparing of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. T2-weighted images of the posterior thalami and lentiform nuclei showed a subtle increase in signal. The anterior thalami appeared mildly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images. Single-voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the left frontal white matter revealed a slight decrease in theN-acetylaspartate-to-creatine ratio; the metabolite ratios were normal on MRS of the region of the left basal ganglia.

Nine months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital with cough and shortness of breath, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia was diagnosed. He received remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen, which was delivered through a high-flow nasal cannula. His clinical condition gradually improved, and he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen, which was to be administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. While the patient was recovering at home, cough persisted and shortness of breath worsened, despite treatment with prednisone. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect with impaired gas exchange, and findings on computed tomography (CT) of the chest were consistent with organizing pneumonia superimposed on fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Treatment with pirfenidone and mycophenolate mofetil was initiated, and the dose of prednisone was increased. Despite the use of these treatments, there was no decrease in dyspnea; consequently, treatment with pirfenidone was stopped, and the dose of prednisone was tapered over the course of the 2 months before the current admission. Because of persistent severe dyspnea on exertion, the patient was listed for lung transplantation 2 weeks before the current admission. Two days before the current admission, myalgias and nausea developed, and an episode of vomiting occurred. The tympanic temperature, as measured by the patient at home, was 40.0\u00b0C. There was also a slight increase in shortness of breath, and the patient began to administer supplemental oxygen at an increased rate of 5 liters per minute. One day before the current admission, a home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported a chronic dry cough that was unchanged. Other medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and prostate cancer that had been treated surgically 4 years before this admission. Medications included albuterol, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ipratropium\u2013albuterol delivered by nebulizer, mycophenolate mofetil, pantoprazole, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. He had no known drug allergies. He drank three or four alcoholic drinks per week and was a lifelong nonsmoker. He lived in a rural area of New England on five acres of land with woods. He used well water at home, but he boiled drinking water before consumption. He owned a dog, and he spent time outdoors, including mowing the lawn 1 week before this admission. He had had mosquito bites but no known tick bites. He was retired from previous work as a welder. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/67 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.8. Respirations were slightly labored, and the patient spoke in short sentences. He was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. No oral thrush was present. There were crackles at the bases of both lung fields. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis results were normal. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.13 (reference range, 0.00 to 0.49). Tests for Lyme disease and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A respiratory viral panel that included testing for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Chest radiography revealed bilateral peripheral reticular opacities that were similar in appearance to those observed in studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier and were consistent with the patient\u2019s reported history of interstitial lung disease, with no new focal consolidation. CT of the chest (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity. There was peripheral reticulation that was unchanged from that seen in the studies obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, basilar-predominant architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis with evidence of honeycombing in the lung bases. There was a slight decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy as compared with the earlier studies and a single new paraesophageal lymph node on the right side. CT of the Chest on Admission.Axial images obtained with lung windows (Panels A and B) show resolution of peripheral consolidation and multifocal ground-glass opacity, which had been observed on CT scans obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, and new peripheral curvilinear opacity (Panel B, yellow arrows). There is subpleural reticulation with associated ground-glass opacity, architectural distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, and honeycombing (Panels A and B, black arrows). These findings are consistent with a CT pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. The new peripheral curvilinear opacity is consistent with previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. As compared with the CT scans obtained 7 and 9 months earlier, the mediastinal windows show a decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Panel C, arrow) and a new paraesophageal lymph node on the lower right side (Panel D, arrow). Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous cefepime was initiated. Twelve hours after the patient presented to the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 82/53 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. One liter of intravenous fluids was administered, and the blood pressure increased to 108/52 mm Hg. Owing to the patient\u2019s acute illness, the dose of prednisone was increased, and he was admitted to the hospital. On hospital day 1, fever persisted; the maximum temporal temperature was 39.9\u00b0C. The blood pressure remained stable; treatment with intravenous vancomycin was added. On hospital day 2, pancytopenia developed, and the results of liver-function tests had worsened; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth.

The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when an enlarging, tender lump developed at the posterior base of the neck on the right side. Two days before presentation, fever to a temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, a mild headache, myalgias, chills, and fatigue developed. He took ibuprofen, but his condition did not improve, and he came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported no history of sore throat, coryza, or earache. He had had a low hemoglobin level in the past but was otherwise healthy. He reportedly had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past, and he had not received an influenza vaccine during the previous year. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He was born in India and came to the United States 4 years previously to attend school; his most recent visit to India was 6 months before presentation. He worked in an office and lived with a roommate. He was not sexually active and had no known exposures to sick contacts, animals, or blood products. He had stopped smoking 2 years before this presentation, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents had diabetes mellitus; there was no family history of autoimmune or connective-tissue diseases. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute. A group of five tender lymph nodes, each approximately 1 cm in diameter, was present in the posteroinferior cervical chain on the right side; the lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain on the left side and in both inguinal regions were nontender, and there were no abnormal lymph nodes in the supraclavicular or axillary regions. A systolic ejection murmur (grade 1 out of 6) was heard at the cardiac base; the remainder of the examination was normal. During evaluation, the temperature rose to 39.5\u00b0C and was associated with chills. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of liver and renal function; testing for heterophile antibodies and rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza virus were negative. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. A blood culture was sterile. The administration of acetaminophen alternating with ibuprofen was recommended, as were fluids and rest. The patient returned home but was advised to return to the outpatient clinic if his condition did not improve. Laboratory Data. Two days later, the patient returned to the clinic. He reported decreased appetite, chills, sweats related to fevers, mild headaches and body aches, and a new nonproductive cough. On examination, the lymph nodes on the right side were slightly larger than on the previous examination and were slightly confluent; the lymph nodes on the left side and a submental lymph node were soft and mobile. Bronchial breath sounds were heard over the right side of the chest anteriorly, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis revealed hemoglobin D Punjab, an abnormal variant of the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin, at a level of 91.8%, as well as a hemoglobin A level of 0% (reference range, 95.8 to 98.0), a hemoglobin A2level of 7.0% (reference range, 2.0 to 3.3), and a hemoglobin F level of 1.2% (reference range, 0.0 to 0.9); other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient declined testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged cervical lymph node was performed, and the aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells. Some of the histiocytes contained cellular debris and angular, crescentic nuclei. The polymorphous composition of the aspirate and the mature appearance of the lymphocytes were suggestive of a reactive process (Figure 1). Gram's and acid-fast staining of the aspirate revealed no organisms. Flow cytometry of the aspirate showed no immunophenotypic abnormalities. Fine-Needle Aspirate of a Cervical Lymph Node.Cytologic smears of the fine-needle aspirate showed a mixed population of lymphocytes and histiocytes, including phagocytic histiocytes with crescentic nuclei (arrow). A blood culture and a culture of the aspirate were sterile. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient returned home again, with instructions to return to the clinic if fevers persisted. Two days later, the patient reported persistent fevers and a dull headache and was admitted to the hospital. He reported no night sweats, weight loss, rhinorrhea, neck rigidity, neck pain, vision changes, weakness, or numbness and no respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. On examination, the blood pressure was 106/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 104 beats per minute; the respirations were 20 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was a superficial ulcer on the right side of the lower lip, and the spleen tip was palpable approximately 3 cm below the costal margin; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactic acid, C3, C4, haptoglobin, creatine kinase, and thyrotropin were normal; testing for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, clear fluid, with 1+ occult blood, trace albumin, and few squamous cells per high-power field, and was otherwise normal. Fluids were administered intravenously, and another blood sample was obtained for culture. The maximal daily temperature was 40.7\u00b0C on the first day. On the second day, the temperature rose to 40.8\u00b0C. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck and chest obtained after the administration of contrast material (Figure 2) showed lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in diameter in the submental, submandibular, and jugular chains and at the posterior cervical level; mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest, at the subcarinal level, measuring 9 mm in diameter; bilateral, clustered axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 10 mm in diameter; a small, anterior pericardial effusion; a soft-tissue nodule, 4 mm in diameter, in the left lower lobe; mild centrilobular emphysema, predominantly in the upper lobe; and occasional subcentimeter cystic lucencies, predominantly in the paramediastinal lingula and right upper lobe. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained after the administration of contrast material showed splenomegaly, measuring 16.5 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension (normal range, <14 cm); a cystic structure, 3.5 cm by 2.6 cm, in the interpolar region of the right kidney; and no evidence of lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. CT Scans of the Neck and Chest.A coronal reformatted image from a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck shows multiple bilateral enhancing cervical lymph nodes, the largest measuring 9 mm in diameter (Panel A, arrow).

The patient had been in his usual state of health until the night before the current evaluation. His wife reported that he fell out of bed at approximately 4 a.m. and was on the floor \u201cshaking.\u201d He appeared confused and was \u201cspeaking gibberish.\u201d Police were called to the patient\u2019s apartment, and emergency medical services were activated. On evaluation at the patient\u2019s home, a fingerstick blood glucose measurement was 110 mg per deciliter (6.1 mmol per liter). The patient was combative and disoriented, and he actively resisted being placed in the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency department, he had a witnessed generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, lasting 2 minutes, for which lorazepam was administered intravenously. A limited history was obtained from the patient\u2019s wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The patient had not been ill recently and had no history of seizures or cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or neurologic disorders. His medical history was notable for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications. He worked in environmental maintenance at a local business. He lived with his wife, daughter, and son. He had immigrated to Boston from a rural area of Guatemala approximately 20 years earlier. He rarely drank alcohol and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. There was no known family history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disease. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 171/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was using a nonrebreather mask. His eyes were open, and an involuntary upward gaze was noted; the pupils were 4 mm, symmetric, and reactive to light. He did not verbally respond to questions or follow commands. Gag and cough reflexes were normal. He withdrew his arms and legs in response to pain, and a jerking motion of the head was noted. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). The neck was supple. Peripheral reflexes were normal. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. Scant blood was observed in the mouth, without visible lacerations. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood specimen was obtained to test for strongyloides antibodies. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114 beats per minute but was otherwise normal.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent surgical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve. In the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate. Six weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to telephone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unresponsive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gabapentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and delirium occurred. When these problems resolved, the patient was discharged home. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic. He expressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evaluation at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharacteristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retaliated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospital for admission. At the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.1Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home. One week before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the telephone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested. The evaluation was conducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videoconferencing technology to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s concerns. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time. Additional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk herniation, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concentrating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved. Medications at the time of evaluation included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazodone, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of absence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and dementia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grandfather, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative. On video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articulated.

One week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patient\u2019s mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swallowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours. The patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per microliter (reference range, 1800 to 7000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The nose was packed to control the bleeding, and 1 unit of platelets was transfused. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. In the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported a mild sore throat but no other symptoms; epistaxis had resolved with nasal packing. There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her illness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The patient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. There were petechiae on the soft palate (Figure 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without splenomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative. Clinical Photograph.A photograph obtained on the day of admission shows a palatal petechia.

The patient had been in her usual good health until approximately 6 days before admission, when she passed a large stool surrounded by clotted blood. During the next 4 days, she had intermittent fevers with associated irritability, as well as decreased oral intake without emesis. She continued to produce 6 to 8 wet diapers per day and to pass soft, brown stools. During the day before admission, a mild cough developed. The patient was evaluated in the office of her pediatrician, and abdominal ultrasonography was scheduled for the next day. That evening, her temperature rose to 40.3\u00b0C; her parents administered ibuprofen and took her to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the patient appeared to be in mild discomfort. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/58 mm Hg, the pulse 170 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.53 kg (93rd percentile). The fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The abdomen was moderately distended, with normal bowel sounds and no apparent tenderness on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Acetaminophen was administered, and the temperature decreased to 36.1\u00b0C. Analysis of a urine specimen obtained by means of catheterization revealed a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity of 1.005, a small amount of blood, and a urobilinogen level of 0.2 mg per deciliter and was otherwise normal. A blood specimen could not be obtained. Abdominal radiography (Figure 1A), performed with the patient in an upright position, revealed the absence of bowel gas in the midabdomen and peripheral displacement of multiple bowel loops, findings suggestive of an abdominal mass; there was a nonobstructive bowel-gas pattern and no free intraperitoneal air or abnormal calcifications. Abdominal ultrasonography (Figure 1B) revealed a large, thick-walled complex cystic mass in the midabdomen that had internal dependent debris and multiple mural satellite cysts. The mass was located predominantly to the left of the midline, displaced the left kidney laterally, and did not have internal vascularity on Doppler imaging. Abdominal Imaging Studies Obtained at the Other Hospital.A radiograph (Panel A) shows the absence of bowel gas in the midabdomen and displacement of adjacent bowel loops. An ultrasound image (Panel B) shows a complex cystic mass in the midabdomen, on the left side, that has internal dependent debris (asterisk) and a thick wall with additional loculations (arrows); the left kidney is displaced laterally (arrowhead). The patient was transferred to this hospital 4.5 hours after her arrival at the other hospital. The patient had been born after an uncomplicated gestation of 41 weeks\u2019 duration. When she was 6.25 months of age (7.5 weeks before this evaluation), she was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because she had four episodes of vomiting over a 3-hour period; she had associated grunting that was suggestive of abdominal pain but had no constipation, fever, or bleeding. On examination at that time, she was afebrile and weighed 8.15 kg (84th percentile); she had mild abdominal distention and voluntary guarding but had no palpable mass or organomegaly. Abdominal radiography revealed a nonspecific bowel-gas pattern. She was able to receive several feedings without complication, and she returned home. The patient\u2019s childhood immunizations were current. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, a sibling, and other relatives. Her maternal grandfather had had colon cancer, and a paternal aunt had died at 20 years of age because of cancer that had been initially manifested by an abdominal cyst; there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. On examination, the patient was fussy but consolable. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/52 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and distended. On palpation, there was a firm fullness above the pubis but no discrete mass. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, amylase, alpha fetoprotein, and human chorionic gonadotropin were normal, as were the results of coagulation and liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. A blood culture was obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen (Figure 2A and 2B), performed in accordance with a pediatric (low dose) protocol after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a complex cystic mass (measuring 14.5 cm in greatest dimension) in the midabdomen. The mass filled the left side of the abdomen and was separate from the bowel. Several loculations of the cyst abutted the pancreatic body and tail. The mass did not contain enteric contrast material, and the attenuation values of the contents of the mass were consistent with fluid. Abdominal Imaging Studies Obtained at This Hospital.CT images (Panels A and B), obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, show a multilobulated cystic mass, with several loculations abutting the pancreas (arrows). A fluoroscopic image (Panel C) shows percutaneous drainage of the mass with a catheter. A fluoroscopic image obtained during the injection of contrast material into the cyst cavity (Panel D) shows communication with an adjacent curvilinear structure (arrows). CT images obtained after the injection (Panels E and F) confirm that the structure is the pancreatic duct (Panel E, arrow) and ampulla (Panel E, arrowhead) and show contrast material in the proximal jejunum (Panel F, arrows), findings consistent with pancreatic communication. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the cystic mass was performed with the use of an 8-French pigtail catheter (Figure 2C). A 500-ml sample of cloudy fluid was aspirated and sent for microbiologic, hematologic, and chemical analysis. Then, iodinated contrast material was injected through the drainage catheter to identify sites of communication with the cystic mass. On fluoroscopic images obtained during the injection (Figure 2D), a curvilinear branching structure adjacent to the cyst cavity was filled with contrast material. A CT scan was obtained immediately after the injection (Figure 2E and 2F) to determine the anatomical location of this structure. During CT, only the necessary amount of radiation was used, in accordance with the Image Gently principles outlined by the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging.1Because this was a follow-up examination targeted to a specific anatomical region, a specific pediatric (low dose) technique was used; the resultant effective dose was 1 mSv, which is equivalent to less than 1 year of background exposure. The findings on CT confirmed that the curvilinear structure filled with contrast material was the pancreatic duct (Figure 2E). In addition, contrast material was seen in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum (Figure 2F); it had presumably passed through the ampulla. Metronidazole, gentamicin, ampicillin, and fluids were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was administered as needed for fevers. During the next 2 days, the patient continued to have low-grade fevers.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admission, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional convulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months. Four months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamotrigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the convulsive episodes. One month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of a second hospital for evaluation. At least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was removed. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward deviation of the eyes when closing) occurred. The patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow commands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was discharged home. During the subsequent month, the patient continued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week. On the morning before the current admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speaking and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straightened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs symmetrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon reflexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs. Approximately 45 minutes after the tremulous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Additional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; however, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive episode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fatigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors. The patient had a history of a febrile seizure in childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported that during the first 6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a family member; he did not elaborate on the nature of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agoraphobia. He took escitalopram daily and lorazepam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His father had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The blood lactate level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine kinase level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400).

The patient was in her usual health until approximately 3 days before admission, when she reportedly began to feel unwell, with weakness, chills, and skin that was abnormally warm to the touch. She self-administered aspirin, without improvement. During the next 2 days, her oral intake decreased. Approximately 22 hours before presentation, vomiting occurred. Nine hours before presentation, she began to travel home to Italy from the eastern United States. During the next 2 hours, increasing abdominal pain occurred, associated with vomiting and shortness of breath, and she took additional aspirin for pain. Approximately 2 hours before presentation, while the patient was in flight, abdominal pain markedly worsened, vomiting increased, and she became confused and unresponsive. The flight was diverted to Boston. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, she was nonverbal and was moaning continuously. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute. The capillary blood glucose level was 116 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter). She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. The patient's history was obtained from her husband through an interpreter. She had non\u2013insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus, hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and chronic kidney disease. Medications included enalapril, metformin, glimepiride, nimesulide, imipramine, aspirin, and ibuprofen. She had no known allergies. She was married and had children. She lived in Italy and did not speak English. She had vacationed in North America for 10 days, traveling to urban areas. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and there was no history of unusual ingestions. On examination, the patient was incoherent and appeared agitated and uncomfortable, with frequent groaning. She was oriented to person only and opened her eyes to command. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 52 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter and minimally reactive to light; the oral mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. The abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound tenderness, or guarding. The skin was cool. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The neurologic examination was limited because of the patient's inability to follow commands; she withdrew all extremities to pain, and cranial nerves and strength appeared normal. Normal saline was rapidly infused, and dextrose, insulin, ondansetron, and morphine sulfate were administered intravenously. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 beats per minute and a QRS duration of 94 msec, with a tremulous baseline possibly obscuring ST-segment depression in the inferior leads. Blood levels of calcium, triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and haptoglobin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Placement of an indwelling urinary catheter was followed by placement of intravascular catheters in the right external jugular vein and the femoral artery. Laboratory Data. Within 2 hours after the patient's arrival in the emergency department, tachypnea and increasing somnolence developed; results of venous oximetry are shown inTable 1. The trachea was intubated after the administration of etomidate and rocuronium, and 100% oxygen was administered and bicarbonate was infused. A chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion. There were ill-defined calcifications in the soft tissue of the left breast. Approximately 3 hours after the patient's arrival, the rectal temperature decreased to 31.7\u00b0C and the blood pressure to 84/43 mm Hg. Norepinephrine bitartrate and bicarbonate were administered; fluids were warmed before infusion, and a blanket warmer was placed. Dark-brown gastric secretions that were positive for occult blood were aspirated through an orogastric tube; the gastric pH was 5.7. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material (Figure 1) revealed pancreatic edema, peripancreatic fat stranding, a small amount of perihepatic and pericholecystic fluid without biliary ductal dilatation, some thickened walls in several loops of small bowel, and an atrophic left kidney containing a nonobstructing calculus. CT of the chest revealed dependent atelectasis, with no focal consolidation, masses, or effusions, and calcifications of the left breast. CT of the brain was normal. Abdominal Imaging.A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, without intravenous or oral contrast material, reveals pancreatic edema and peripancreatic fat stranding and fluid (arrows), features consistent with acute pancreatitis. No pseudocyst or gallstones were visualized. Cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole were administered intravenously. After laboratory results were known, sodium polystyrene sulfonate was given orally. Toxicologic screening of the blood and urine was negative. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). Vasopressin, propofol, and calcium were added, and additional bicarbonate and glucose were administered. Eight hours after her presentation, continuous venovenous hemofiltration with bicarbonate solution was begun. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. Fourteen hours after presentation, the urine sodium level was 136 mmol per liter, and the urine creatinine level was 0.25 mg per milliliter. Echocardiography revealed normal global cardiac function, without pericardial effusion. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed small-volume ascites, nonspecific thickening of the gallbladder wall, and an atrophic left kidney; there was increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys (Figure 2). Renal Imaging.An ultrasonographic study of the abdomen shows an atrophic left kidney (Panel A) and increased renal parenchymal echogenicity of both kidneys (Panels A and B), features suggestive of chronic renal disease.

The patient had undergone annual MRI of the breasts since she was 39 years of age because of a strong family history of breast cancer: her mother had received a diagnosis of bilateral lobular breast carcinoma at 60 years of age, her maternal grandmother had received a diagnosis of breast cancer at 70 years of age, a maternal cousin had received a diagnosis of breast cancer in her 30s, and the patient had undergone excisional biopsies of the breasts because of breast fibroadenoma at 20 years of age and fibrocystic changes at 33 years of age. Ten years before the current presentation, she had had dyspnea after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy, rectus diastasis repair, and a right ovarian cystectomy for a 3-mm complex right adnexal mass, which was shown on histologic examination to be a hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst. That symptom of dyspnea was evaluated with the use of electrocardiography and computed tomography (CT) of the legs and chest for venous thromboembolism; the results of the evaluations were normal. A few months before the current presentation, she had had trauma to the chest wall on the right side during a skiing accident. The patient had no current dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, or wheeze but had an intermittent and self-limited mild sensation of dyspnea and a rapid heart rate after eating to fullness. She had no chest discomfort but had had discomfort in the right side of her back for a few weeks. Otherwise, she had no constitutional, cardiac, rheumatologic, musculoskeletal, or neurologic symptoms. The patient\u2019s medical history included a cesarean section (for arrest of fetal descent and chorioamnionitis), two vaginal births after cesarean section, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (treated with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure), oral herpes simplex virus, supraventricular tachycardia, mild gastroesophageal reflux, a small hiatal hernia (with normal endoscopic results), and muscle fasciculations and paresthesia (which had been evaluated 11 years earlier by a neurologist and had since been quiescent). She was currently up to date on routine cancer screenings and had had normal colonoscopy results and a normal Papanicolaou smear during the previous 6 months. Medications included valacyclovir, as needed. She had allergies to latex, which caused a skin reaction, and sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and had never used illicit drugs; she consumed alcohol rarely, on social occasions. She was employed as a physician-scientist, lived with her husband, and had three healthy daughters. Her family owned a farm in New England, where she had previously worked during the summer. She had two dogs at home but no other environmental or chemical exposures. She had traveled to Africa and to China, where she had visited a panda reserve. In addition to the history of breast cancer among her maternal relatives, her father had had prostate cancer, a paternal cousin had had lymphoma, her paternal grandmother had had colon cancer, and multiple maternal and paternal cousins, aunts, and uncles had had esophageal, gastric, renal, lung, and salivary-gland cancers. Furthermore, her mother had osteoporosis and thyroid nodules, her father had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for normal-pressure hydrocephalus, her paternal grandfather had had Parkinson\u2019s disease, one sister had a ventriculoseptal defect that did not require surgery, another sister had a parathyroid cyst, and a third sister had three adenomatous colonic polyps. On examination at the pulmonary clinic, the heart rate was 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination, including a lung examination, was normal. A basic metabolic profile, a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and results of liver-function tests were normal (Table 1). Pulmonary-function testing revealed normal spirometry and diffusion capacity. Previous imaging studies of the chest were reviewed, and additional studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Review of the patient\u2019s previous imaging studies (Figure 1) revealed a long-standing history of a right pleural effusion, which had first been noticed on MRI of the breasts that had been performed 14 years before the current presentation. Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax, performed as part of her evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, revealed a persistent, small right pleural effusion without abnormal pleural thickening, enhancement, or nodularity. There were several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules that had been unchanged for more than 5 years and were thought to represent noncalcified granulomas or intraparenchymal lymph nodes. The lungs were otherwise normal and had no evidence of cancer. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A right pleural effusion was seen on multiple imaging studies over time. An axial fast spin\u2013echo T2-weighted MRI scan of the right breast, obtained with the patient in the prone position 14 years before the current presentation (Panel A), shows a right pleural effusion (arrow) in the anterior (dependent) right hemithorax. An axial contrast-enhanced CT scan of the midthorax, obtained on presentation to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital (Panel B), shows persistence of the right pleural effusion (arrow). There is no abnormal pleural enhancement or nodularity and no evidence of cancer in the lungs. Several subcentimeter pulmonary nodules (not shown) have long-term stability (>5 years) and therefore are considered to be benign. A radiograph of the chest, obtained with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position during follow-up (Panel C), shows continued persistence of the small right pleural effusion, which is seen layering and extending into the minor fissure (arrow). A chest radiograph, obtained with the patient in the right decubitus position, showed trace layering of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax and in the minor fissure. The amount of pleural fluid was insufficient to sample, but serial images showed evidence of stability and cancer screenings were up to date (with no evidence of cancer on imaging studies of the chest), and thus the plan was to obtain repeat images of the chest in 8 weeks. During ongoing surveillance of the pleural effusion, uterine bleeding, pelvic fullness, bloating, urinary urgency, and dyspareunia developed. Because of the patient\u2019s history of an ovarian mass and her concerns about her strong family history of cancer, additional imaging studies were obtained. A pelvic ultrasound study revealed a solid, hypoechoic pelvic mass anterior to the uterus, measuring 9.9 cm in greatest diameter. The left ovary contained a small simple cyst, and the right ovary was not identified. MRI of the pelvis revealed that the pelvic mass made contact with the right broad ligament but not the uterus. Additional findings included a moderate volume of free fluid, a normal endometrium, and a 3.6-cm intramural uterine fibroid in the posterior uterine body. On both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, the mass was hypointense and showed low-level enhancement throughout (Figure 2). On the basis of the appearance of the pelvic mass on imaging studies, the differential diagnosis was narrow and limited to a fibrous ovarian tumor (e.g., fibroma, fibrothecoma, or cystadenofibroma) or a broad-ligament fibroid. Very few ovarian tumors are both uniformly solid and hypointense on T2-weighted imaging, and thus there is a higher degree of specificity when these features are present.1,2 Imaging Studies of the Pelvis.Axial and sagittal fast spin\u2013echo T2-weighted MRI scans of the pelvis (Panels A and B, respectively) and axial three-dimensional fat-saturated gradient-recalled echo T1-weighted MRI scans of the pelvis, obtained before (Panel C) and after (Panel D) the administration of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast material, are shown. A pelvic mass measuring 9.9 cm in greatest dimension (Panels A through D, black asterisks) is shown in contact with the right broad ligament (Panel A, black arrow). The mass has a low signal on T2-weighted images (Panels A and B) and has heterogeneous, low-level enhancement throughout, indicating that it is solid (Panel D). There is no visible connection between the mass and the uterine corpus. Additional findings include a moderate volume of free fluid (Panels A and B, white arrows), a normal endometrium, a 3.6-cm intramural fibroid in the posterior uterine body (Panels A through D, white asterisks), and a small simple cyst in the left ovary (not shown); the right ovary is not identified. An endometrial biopsy was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a proliferative endometrium and fragments of benign endocervix.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 years before this admission, when she received abnormal results of liver-function tests at another hospital. She underwent a follow-up evaluation that revealed an elevated antinuclear antibody titer. Levels of ceruloplasmin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and antimitochondrial antibodies were normal, and tests for tissue transglutaminase antibodies and viral hepatitis were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis with cirrhosis was made, and treatment with glucocorticoids was recommended. However, results of liver-function tests reportedly normalized without treatment during the following year. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, malaise, fatigue, and jaundice developed in the patient, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. The alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were elevated at 1844 IU per liter (reference range, 0 to 40) and 1451 IU per liter (reference range, 0 to 37), respectively. She had a bilirubin level of 7.9 mg per deciliter (135.1 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17.1 \u03bcmol per liter]), an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:640 (reference range, <1:160), detectable anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies, and an IgG level of 2584 mg per deciliter (reference range, 700 to 1600). Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver. Prednisone therapy was begun. The patient\u2019s condition improved, and plans were made to transition treatment from prednisone to azathioprine. However, the patient elected to taper the course of prednisone within 4 weeks and started to take natural supplements instead of the prescribed azathioprine. Two weeks later, approximately 7 days before this admission, the patient\u2019s daughter noted that her mother had jaundice. Four days before this admission, the patient was found on the floor of her home and was delirious; she was admitted to the other hospital. She had a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, an albumin level of 2.4 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.2 to 5.2), a total bilirubin level of 15.4 mg per deciliter (263.3 \u03bcmol per liter), an alanine aminotransferase level of 1040 IU per liter, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 738 IU per liter, an ammonia level of 66 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 11 to 51), an international normalized ratio (INR) of 5.2 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.2), a creatinine level of 0.57 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), a lactate level of 9.9 mmol per liter (89 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and a platelet count of 111,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an ill-defined echogenicity of the right lobe of the liver that had not been present 3 months earlier; there was no hydronephrosis. Oral methylprednisone, intravenous vitamin K, lactulose, and rifaximin were administered. Oliguric acute kidney injury developed, with a creatinine level as high as 3.6 mg per deciliter (318 \u03bcmol per liter). Results of an evaluation of the urine sediment were unremarkable. An albumin infusion was administered, but the patient had no improvement in creatinine level or urine output. The patient\u2019s kidney injury was considered to be consistent with the hepatorenal syndrome. Midodrine and octreotide were administered. Fever and leukocytosis (with a white-cell count as high as 27,000 per cubic millimeter [reference range, 4200 to 10,200]) developed, and a blood sample was obtained for culture. After approximately 56 hours of incubation, microbial growth was detected in the aerobic blood-culture bottle, and a Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth showed a corkscrew-shaped gram-negative rod (Figure 1). Empirical vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered; ceftriaxone therapy was discontinued after one dose, and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam therapy was initiated. The patient was then transferred to the medical service of this hospital. Blood-Culture Broth at the Other Hospital.At the other hospital, a blood sample was cultured in an aerobic bottle. A Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth shows corkscrew-shaped (arrow) and curved (arrowhead) gram-negative rods. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that she had had nonbloody diarrhea during the days before the evaluation at the other hospital, without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She also reported that she had coughed up blood-tinged sputum once during the weeks before admission, but she had had no hematemesis, melena, or other bleeding. The patient had a history of heavy alcohol consumption and had undergone a tubal ligation. She had taken no prescribed medications before admission to the other hospital, but she had been taking supplements, including milk thistle and buckthorn. She did not report the use of any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The use of codeine caused nausea and vomiting. The patient was from a city in a neighboring state and lived alone. She worked in the health care field and had an adult daughter who was healthy. For several years, she had consumed 3 to 5 half gallons of distilled spirits per week, but she stopped drinking alcohol after she received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis 6 years earlier. She had a remote history of smoking and did not report the use of any illicit drugs. She had an indoor cat but no other exposure to animals, and had not traveled recently. There was no family history of liver disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/60 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared fatigued but was oriented to person, place, and time, and she could recite the days of the week backward. The sclerae were icteric and the skin was jaundiced, with scattered spider angiomata and faint ecchymoses. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended, with a possible fluid wave. The liver and spleen were not palpable. Clinically significant edema was present from the lower legs to the sacrum. A limited neurologic examination revealed no asterixis. A urinalysis was unremarkable. Tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed multifocal air-space opacities and bilateral pleural effusions (Figure 2A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, central interlobular septal thickening, and a nodular hepatic contour (Figure 2B and 2C). There were multiple prominent portal and perihepatic lymph nodes and small-volume ascites. Imaging Studies.A chest radiograph obtained in a frontal view (Panel A) shows multifocal patchy air-space opacities, as well as indistinct pulmonary vasculature and fluid along the minor fissure, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema. A coronal CT image of the chest, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel B), shows bilateral ground-glass opacities and mild interlobular septal thickening in a predominantly central distribution. An axial CT image of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel C), shows the nodular contour of the liver (arrow).

The patient had been well until 2 years before this evaluation, when intermittent arthralgias developed in the joints of the hands. Four months before presentation, the pain in the hands became more severe, and new joint pain developed in the wrists, knees, ankles, and shoulders. He had occasional joint stiffness, most commonly in the morning. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The blood levels of electrolytes were reportedly normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests, the complete blood count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A screening test for Lyme disease was reportedly negative. Despite the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the joint arthralgias did not abate, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported the new development of a rash on his hands and feet, as well as pain in his calves that worsened after prolonged standing. He had no fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, several small, nonblanching, petechial lesions were noted on the hands and feet, and four slightly raised, erythematous lesions were seen on the hands and left lower leg. He had tenderness in the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as pain with motion of the hips and knees. The muscles of the calves were firm and tender on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count and differential count were normal. Blood tests for rheumatoid factor and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 11), and the C-reactive protein level was 58 mg per liter (reference value, <8). Blood tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a speckled pattern. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone were prescribed. However, during the next week, the patient had difficulty walking owing to progressively worsening calf pain, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported dry mouth and weight loss of 9 kg over a period of 2 months that he attributed to changes in diet and exercise. Two days before presentation, he had noted redness and mild pain in both eyes but no blurred vision. Five days before presentation, his temperature measured at home had been 37.9\u00b0C. His medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which had resulted in a stricture that required balloon dilation of the distal esophagus. Twenty-two months before this presentation, mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels detected during routine laboratory testing had been attributed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. He had had multiple previous tick bites and had been treated empirically with doxycycline in the past, most recently 14 months before presentation. Medications were hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, omeprazole, ergocalciferol, alprazolam, a multivitamin, and glucosamine. The patient did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol occasionally. He was married with two children and lived in a suburb of Boston. He worked as an executive in a local firm. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/88 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the episcleral vessels was present in both eyes, and a violaceous hue was noted in the underlying sclera (Figure 1A). The patient was able to stand from a seated position without the use of his hands, but ambulation was difficult because of pain in the calves. The calves appeared swollen, without erythema or warmth, and were firm and tender on palpation. There was pain on flexion and extension of the right great toe, with no erythema, warmth, or swelling of the joints. Erythematous papules were present on the left wrist, the left olecranon (Figure 1B), and the right olecranon. Several erythematous lesions were noted on the left lower leg and right foot (Figure 1C and 1D) and on the hands; they were not raised and did not blanch with pressure. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood (reference value, negative), 1+ protein (reference value, negative), 50 to 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). Examination of the urine sediment revealed dysmorphic red cells and red-cell casts that were too numerous to count. Blood tests for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibody, anti-Ro antibody, and anti-La antibody were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies of the left leg were obtained. Clinical Images.Images were obtained during the initial evaluation at this hospital. Panel A shows diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the episcleral vessels in both eyes and a violaceous hue in the underlying sclera. Panel B shows erythematous papules on the left olecranon. Panels C and D show several erythematous, nonblanching lesions that are not raised (some of which measure 4 mm in diameter) on the left lower leg and right foot.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower leg (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, revealed nonspecific, diffuse muscle edema, which was most prominent in the posterior compartment of the calf, with mild associated contrast enhancement. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, myonecrosis, bony involvement, or drainable fluid collections. MRI of the Left Lower Leg.An axial T2-weighted, fat-suppressed image (Panel A) and an axial T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced image (Panel B) of the left mid-calf show diffuse edema (Panel A, asterisk) and enhancement (Panel B, asterisk) of the muscles, most pronounced in the posterior compartment of the calf. An axial T1-weighted image of the left mid-calf without fat suppression or gadolinium (Panel C) shows normal muscle bulk, without radiographically significant fatty muscle atrophy. A sagittal short-tau inversion recovery image of the left lower leg (Panel D) shows that the signal abnormality in the muscle spans essentially the entire length of the lower leg (asterisk).

The patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when night sweats developed, which he attributed to the summer heat. Three days before admission, episodes of sharp abdominal pain developed; the pain was greatest at the costal margin on the right side, and the patient rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted up to 2.5 hours, increased with deep breaths, was worse 1 to 2 hours after meals, and was associated with mild nausea, belching, hiccups, bloating, and loose, gray stools. The symptoms did not improve with simethicone or ibuprofen. On the day of admission, the pain recurred with increased severity, and the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. Two weeks before admission, the patient had had a sharp frontal headache for several days after having traveled to a coastal region in the northeastern United States. He had had psoriasis since 10 years of age and, during the previous year, a few episodes of vertigo with ear fullness, for which he took meclizine, with improvement. A diagnosis of erythema nodosum had been made 3 years before admission, when he presented with raised, painful nodules on the shins and ankle pain; 1 month later, he had an episode of pain and erythema in the right knee (a synovial-fluid aspirate reportedly showed low cell counts and negative cultures). He also had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus,an appendectomy, a herniorrhaphy, and a turbinectomy. He reported no fevers, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, new rashes, or bruises. His only medication was topical clobetasol. He was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and hydrocodone. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and worked in a medical facility. His mother had diverticulitis, and his father had hypertension. His siblings were healthy; he had no children. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, without distention and with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The spleen tip was palpable. There were matted, firm lymph nodes in the inguinal region and hyperpigmented, scaly plaques on the lower legs and waist; the remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 5800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with 73% neutrophils (reference range, 40 to 70), 14% lymphocytes (reference range, 22 to 44), 6% monocytes (reference range, 4 to 11), and 7% eosinophils (reference range, 0 to 8); the blood level of C-reactive protein was 9.7 mg per liter (reference range, <8.0, negative for inflammation), and the blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 55 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). The remainder of the complete blood count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a urinalysis were normal, as were results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and lipase. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen was negative; testing for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, with a borderline early-repolarization abnormality and T-wave inversions in leads V1and V2. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed multiple rounded, hypoechoic areas in the spleen, which was not enlarged, with no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed numerous ill-defined, hypoattenuating lesions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, in the spleen (Figure 1), as well as bilateral, dependent atelectasis in the lungs. A hypoattenuating lesion in the liver, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, was slightly increased in size from a study 8 years earlier and was thought to represent a cyst; small, nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes were also seen. A chest radiograph showed an ill-defined opacity in the left apex, overlying the end of the first rib, and a rounded opacity in the left hilar region. An ultrasound examination of the legs revealed benign-appearing enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the largest of which was 1.5 cm by 0.6 cm. Image of the Abdomen.An axial image from a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen, which was obtained on admission, shows multiple hypoattenuating nodules (arrows) in a normal-size spleen. The patient's abdominal pain improved, and he was discharged on the second hospital day. At a follow-up visit 2 days after discharge, a CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes as large as 1.8 cm in diameter. The CT scan also showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, an enlarged anterior diaphragmatic lymph node (1.2 cm in diameter), clustered nodular opacities within the lung in a perilymphatic distribution (Figure 2), multiple splenic lesions, a hypervascular lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver, and a hypodense lesion (0.6 cm in diameter) in the left lobe of the liver, which was thought to represent a hepatic cyst. Images of the Chest.A CT scan of the lung shows bilateral peribronchovascular nodules (Panel A, arrows), with a cluster in the left upper lobe (Panel B, arrow).

Approximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he presented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3\u00b0C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol. Three weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with \u201ccoughing fits\u201d and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal. The next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. He reported a 1-month history of \u201cstabbing\u201d back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal. Laboratory test results obtained at that time are shown inTable 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On the systems review, the patient reported that he had recently measured heart rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute on his home pulse oximeter; his baseline heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute. He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attributed to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chronic hepatitis B virus infection,Helicobacter pyloriinfection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental procedure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine administered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a local university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examination revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Figure 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Figure 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism. Initial Cardiac Imaging Studies.A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained shortly after presentation to this hospital (Panel A) shows normal sinus rhythm with second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block. The P waves are indicated by asterisks. The QRS complexes show variation; the fourth, fifth, and eighth complexes are conducted with a right bundle-branch block aberrancy in a typical rSR\u2032 pattern in lead V1, which is indicated by arrows. A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained approximately 20 minutes earlier (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block. There is atrioventricular dissociation, which is defined as the absence of an apparent relationship between the P waves (asterisks) and the QRS complexes. The sinus rate of approximately 80 beats per minute is faster than the ventricular rate. The ventricular escape rhythm is junctional, as evidenced by the relatively narrow QRS complexes and an escape rate of approximately 50 beats per minute. A transthoracic echocardiogram in the parasternal long-axis view with color Doppler (Panel C) shows mild diastolic mitral regurgitation, a finding consistent with atrioventricular block. Intravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetaminophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall-motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1There was no evidence of valvular vegetations. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and anaplasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia. On the third hospital day, tests for SARS-CoV-2,Bartonella henselaeandB. quintanaantibodies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas positive. The patient underwent cardiac CT with electrocardiographic gating, including contrast-enhanced CT angiography and delayed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary sinus of the aortic valve showed increased radiodensity on delayed imaging (Figure 2A and 2B); these findings are suggestive of inflammatory changes and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricuspid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular vegetations, thrombi, or calcifications.", "true_dx": "Regional myocarditis due to infection withListeria monocytogenes.", "pred_dx": "Infective Endocarditis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's see what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 56-year-old guy who's been dealing with some pretty uncomfortable stuff over the past few weeks.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He started off with muscle pains and fevers, which sounds like it might be something viral or maybe even an infection.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But then, things get interesting because he has these weird heart issues popping up.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His heart rate is dropping, and he's experiencing different kinds of arrhythmias.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's definitely concerning.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, I'm thinking about what could cause both the systemic symptoms and the heart problems.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, infections can sometimes mess with the heart, especially if they're bacterial or fungal.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And wait, he did grow up in a part of the world where certain diseases are more common, like tropical regions.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That makes me wonder if we should consider something like endocarditis caused by bacteria from those areas.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But hold on, there's more.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's got a history of sickle cell trait, which means he's more prone to certain infections.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, he's got a bunch of other health issues like hypertension and a history of pulmonary embolism.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "These could complicate things too.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and he's been vaccinated against COVID-19, so that's one thing we don't need to worry about.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The lab work shows elevated inflammatory markers, which suggests some kind of inflammation or infection.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And the CT scan shows some unusual changes around the heart, like increased density in the epicardial fat and the interatrial septum.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That could mean there's some sort of inflammation or abscess forming.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's starting to sound like infective endocarditis again, but we need to think about what kind of bug could cause this.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's go through the possibilities.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Endocarditis due to Bartonella species comes to mind because of the fever and the heart issues.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana are known for causing similar symptoms.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, the tests came back negative for those specific bugs.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, maybe we're missing something.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and there's the positive result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 25, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a big clue!

The patient had been well until she was 16 years of age, when bilateral thyroid nodularity developed, with normal thyroid function. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration at another hospital reportedly showed cytologic features that were suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Near-total thyroidectomy (100% of the right lobe and 80% of the left lobe) was performed. Postoperatively, levothyroxine was administered. Fourteen years later, a mass developed in the left side of the neck. Ultrasonography performed at a second hospital reportedly showed a nodule, 9 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the thyroid. On cytologic examination, a sample of the nodule obtained by core needle biopsy reportedly was suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. A completion thyroidectomy with dissection of the strap muscles was performed. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, hypoparathyroidism developed. Six months later, a mass recurred in the left side of the neck. During the next year, hot flashes developed, and a diagnosis of primary ovarian failure was made when the patient was 32 years of age. When the patient was 33.5 years of age, ultrasonography of the thyroid reportedly revealed a small amount of thyroid tissue on the right side and a new echogenic thyroid nodule on the left side, which displaced the carotid artery. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirate from the nodule was reportedly suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. She was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. The patient reported no hoarseness, dysphagia, shortness of breath, or neck pain. She had a history of fibrocystic breast disease and had undergone multiple, benign breast biopsies, and she had been exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero. She had undergone a right ovarian cystectomy, stripping of varicose veins, and tonsillectomy, as well as excision of skin lesions on the face, with unknown histopathological findings. There was no history of neck irradiation. Medications included levothyroxine, calcitriol, estradiol (administered by a transdermal patch), and oral progesterone (12 days per month). She had an allergy to shellfish (manifested by angioedema) and had no known allergies to medications. She was married, had no children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had thyroiditis, her father had had colonic polyps, and a sister had had a small goiter at 31 years of age. On examination, the blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute, and the weight 95.3 kg. The patient was obese, with facial acne. There was a healed surgical scar on the neck and a mobile, rubbery nodule, 4 cm in diameter, in the upper left thyroid bed. A positive Chvostek's sign (brisk twitching of the lips) was elicited on percussion of the homolateral masseter region, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Eight months later, the left thyroid nodule measured 6 cm in diameter on examination; computed tomography (CT) of the neck, performed without the administration of contrast material, and ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass, 48 mm in diameter, with central calcification at the level of the left thyroid bed. Completion thyroidectomy of the left lobe with partial strap-muscle resection was performed. Pathological examination showed an adenomatous goiter and no evidence of cancer. Postoperatively, liothyronine (l-isomer of triiodothyronine [T3]) was administered. The blood level of thyrotropin was 26.4 \u03bcU per milliliter (normal range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the level of thyroglobulin 1.8 ng per milliliter (normal range, 4 to 40). The thyroglobulin antibody and urinary iodine levels were normal. The 24-hour uptake of radioactive iodine (iodine-123) was 9%, and the scan of the thyroid with iodine-123 showed a single focus of intense uptake in the left thyroid bed and a subtle focus of uptake in the right thyroid bed. Whole-body scanning performed 3 days after an oral dose of 49.9 mCi of iodine-131 and immediately after the intravenous injection of 39.6 MBq of technetium-99m pertechnetate, with multiple dual-photon images of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, showed iodine uptake in the midline and the right side of the neck, findings suggestive of a remnant of thyroid tissue. When the patient was 35.5 years old, analogue mammography performed at another hospital revealed abnormalities in the left breast. Pathological examination of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-biopsy specimens of separate lesions in the left breast reportedly showed intraductal sclerosing papilloma and benign ductal hyperplasia. One month later, the patient returned to this hospital. The blood level of thyroglobulin was less than 0.2 ng per milliliter. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, thyrotropin, and thyroglobulin antibody were normal. Focused ultrasound examination of the left breast showed a dilated duct (5 mm by 8 mm in cross section) that consisted of mixed echotex-tures. During the next 5 months, four excisional biopsies of lesions in the left breast were performed. Pathological examination of the specimens showed ductal carcinoma in situ (grade 2) spanning at least 1.2 cm; a low-grade phyllodes tumor, 1.1 cm; a hamartoma, 1 cm, with benign ductal hyperplasia; intraductal papilloma; atypical ductal hyperplasia; atypical lobular hyperplasia; atypical apocrine hyperplasia; and proliferative fibrocystic changes. The ductal carcinoma in situ cells expressed both estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor proteins. Treatment with estrogen and progesterone was stopped, and a course of radiation therapy was administered to the left breast. At the age of 36.5 years, the patient returned to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital for follow-up. On examination, there were micronodular lesions on the gingiva and tongue (Figure 1A and 1B); the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small hypoechoic region of the left thyroid bed that measured 6 mm in maximal dimension, an increase from 3 mm 1.5 years earlier.

The patient had been well until 4 months before this admission, when painless swelling developed in the groin area bilaterally; there were no other symptoms. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. He had multiple enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, which were mobile and nontender on palpation; the largest was 3 cm in diameter. The white-cell count was 5460 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 168,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), and the hemoglobin level 11.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). An interferon-\u03b3\u2013release assay (IGRA) forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. The patient was referred for a lymph-node biopsy but chose not to pursue it. Three weeks before this admission, the patient was again evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. The size of the enlarged lymph nodes had not changed, and there were no new symptoms. He was again referred for a biopsy. Three days later, a core-needle biopsy of a left inguinal lymph node was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed necrotic tissue with fibrosis and lymphohistiocytic inflammation; no definitive lymph-node tissue was present. Staining for acid-fast bacilli, Brown\u2013Hopps staining, and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver staining were negative. No malignant cells were identified. Biopsy Specimen of Left Inguinal Lymph Node.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen is shown at low magnification (Panel A) and at high magnification (Panels B, C, and D). The specimen shows extensive necrosis (Panel B, arrow) with some inflammatory cells; giant cells of Langerhans type (Panel C, arrows) adjacent to histiocytes and necrosis; and lymphohistiocytic inflammation (Panel D), with no evidence of lymphoma or other cancers. Three days before the current admission, a nosebleed developed and resolved spontaneously. The morning of admission, a petechial rash developed on both legs, and the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported 3 months of nonproductive cough that had been attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had no fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, headache, or palpable masses other than the inguinal lymphadenopathy. He had a history of \u03b2-thalassemia trait and deficiencies of vitamin B12and folate. For the past 15 years, a chronic pruritic rash on the thighs had occurred intermittently. Two months before this admission, he had received a diagnosis ofHelicobacter pyloriinfection and had been treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole. Current medications included cyanocobalamin, folate, albuterol, fluticasone nasal spray, and clotrimazole cream. There were no known drug allergies. The patient worked as a scientist and his research involved mice, but he had no pets. He was married and monogamous with his wife. Eleven years earlier, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England from northeast India, where he was born. He had last traveled to India 6 years earlier; family members had visited 4 years earlier. The patient had also traveled throughout all regions of the United States during the past 11 years. He drank one alcoholic beverage weekly and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s mother had hypertension, and his father had died from valvular heart disease. One of his sisters had received treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis 1 year earlier, and a second sister had latent tuberculosis; a third sister had diabetes. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. He appeared well. Purpura, including a hemorrhagic blister 1 cm in diameter, was noted in the oral mucosa. There were diffuse petechiae on the legs and some petechiae on the torso, flanks, and forearms. There were enlarged, nontender inguinal lymph nodes, which were nonmobile and up to 4 cm in diameter on the left side and were mobile on the right side; no other palpable lymphadenopathy was noted. The platelet count was 0 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- and renal-function tests and urinalysis. Screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed very few platelets and no platelet clumps. There were target red cells and elliptocytes; the morphologic features of the lymphocytes were normal.

Ultrasonography of the palpable abnormality in the left groin (Figure 2A) revealed a well-circumscribed mass superficial to the iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind and central necrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2B, 2C, and 2D), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed a conglomerate lymph-node mass, measuring 4.0 cm by 2.1 cm by 3.1 cm, in the superficial left inguinal region, with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity. There were similar-appearing lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and the left iliac chain. There was also mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm in diameter, as well as a small lymph node in the right minor fissure. The spleen measured 13.5 cm in length (reference range, <12.2 cm). Positron-emission tomography (PET) from the skull base to the thighs (Figure 2E and 2F), performed after the administration of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed extensive areas of intense FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as physiologic uptake in the pharyngeal and mandibular areas. Imaging Studies.An ultrasonographic image of the left inguinal lymph node, obtained with color Doppler (Panel A), shows a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass (outline) superficial to the left iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind. The center of the mass is markedly hypoechoic and has scattered echogenic foci that are indicative of debris. An axial computed tomographic (CT) image (Panel B) shows a nodal mass (outline) with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity, a finding that corresponds to the abnormality observed on ultrasonography and physical examination. Coronal and sagittal reconstructed CT images (Panels C and D, respectively) show enlarged lymph nodes with peripheral enhancement and central hypodensity in the retroperitoneum (arrows) and left iliac chain (arrowheads), in addition to the dominant nodal mass in the left groin (outline). A fused axial18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomographic (PET) image (Panel E) and a whole-body maximum-intensity-projection FDG-PET image (Panel F) show marked FDG uptake in the left inguinal nodal mass (outlines), as well as moderate FDG uptake in multiple mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes (black arrows), retroperitoneal lymph nodes (white arrow), and lymph nodes in the left iliac chain (arrowhead). Prednisone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, prednisone was stopped and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered. During the next 3 days, the platelet count increased and the petechiae abated. On the sixth hospital day, the platelet count was 83 per microliter.

The patient had been generally well until 12 years before this presentation, when lymphadenopathy in the axillary and inguinal regions developed and a diagnosis of stage III follicular lymphoma was made. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were administered and induced a clinical response; rituximab maintenance therapy was initiated. Seven years before this presentation, recurrent disease developed; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone were administered. The patient again had a clinical remission, and rituximab maintenance therapy was resumed. Two years before the current presentation, the patient transferred his oncologic care to this hospital. Swelling was noted in the right inguinal region, and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive FDG uptake throughout the body. Biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node revealed high-grade follicular lymphoma. Salvage chemotherapy with cisplatin, gemcitabine, rituximab, and dexamethasone was administered, and the patient had an early clinical remission. Four months later, and 20 months before the current presentation, the patient underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation after the administration of carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan. After transplantation, his clinical course was complicated by acute deep-vein thrombosis of the left leg; treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin sodium was initiated but was discontinued after 1 week owing to severe thrombocytopenia. Five months later, clinical signs of lymphoma relapse were observed, and biopsy of an enlarged axillary lymph node revealed transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was subsequently treated with several therapies, including blinatumomab, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and pembrolizumab, none of which induced a sustained clinical response. Because of the lack of clinical response, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was considered. Two and a half weeks before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital for severe pain in the epigastrium and bilateral inguinal regions. Laboratory studies revealed a lactate dehydrogenase level of 1560 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210), an alanine aminotransferase level of 127 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), an aspartate aminotransferase level of 143 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), an alkaline phosphatase level of 1506 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100), and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.0). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed several clustered small pulmonary nodules, progressive hepatosplenomegaly with normal-appearing bile ducts, multifocal enlarging lymph nodes, and new small-volume ascites. Oral methadone and morphine sulfate and a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone were administered, resulting in alleviation of pain and improvement in liver function. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day. Two weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for recurrent severe, sharp pain in the bilateral inguinal regions, as well as diffuse abdominal pain in the upper quadrants that was no longer responsive to oral analgesic agents. He also reported night sweats, decreased energy, poor appetite, nausea, and constipation. He did not have fevers, chills, headache, vision changes, shortness of breath, cough, or dysuria. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, nystatin oral elixir, methadone, morphine sulfate, citalopram, omeprazole, simethicone, and a multivitamin, as well as lorazepam and laxatives as needed. He had no known allergies to medications. The patient was born and raised in central Mexico and often returned to visit family. He had moved to the United States 2 years before this presentation. He lived with his wife and two adolescent daughters in an urban neighborhood in New England. He worked in the information technology industry. He had previously smoked one cigarette daily and had quit 4 years earlier; he drank one beer every other week and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had breast cancer, and his father had had coronary artery disease, hypertension, and alcohol use disorder. His children were healthy. On examination in the oncology clinic, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 138 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/84 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 61.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 20.0. He had cachexia and was in moderate distress from pain. The mucous membranes were dry, and thrush was present in the oropharynx. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; the right and left upper quadrants were moderately tender on palpation. Painful lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, supraclavicular, and inguinal chains was present. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time, and no confusion was noted. There was no rash. Blood levels of electrolytes and results of renal function tests and urinalysis were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On arrival at the oncology unit, the patient was observed to be in severe pain. Intravenous morphine and normal saline were administered. A platelet transfusion was begun. Thirty minutes later, shaking chills and diaphoresis developed. On examination, the temperature was 39.1\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation was 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was somnolent and oriented to self but not to location or time, and he had slow, nonsensical speech. Blood cultures were obtained. Oxygen, intravenous cefepime and meperidine, and oral metronidazole and acetaminophen were administered; the administration of fentanyl with a patient-controlled analgesia pump was begun for pain control. By the following morning, the patient\u2019s mental status had returned to baseline. On the second hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fever persisted. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Filgrastim was administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed heterogeneous liver parenchyma, diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, and no dilatation of the bile ducts. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple new, poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver and new bilateral pleural effusions. There was gradual reduction in the multifocal abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and stable splenomegaly with hypodense splenic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was recommended for further characterization of the lesions. Imaging Studies.Axial, contrast-enhanced CT images (Panels A and B) show multiple poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver (arrows). A coronal, contrast-enhanced CT image (Panel C) shows multifocal abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy (asterisks) and splenomegaly. An axial, T2-weighted MRI (Panel D) and axial, gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRIs (Panels E and F) show multiple lesions in the liver (arrows) and spleen (arrowheads), with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appreciable enhancement. On the third hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fevers persisted and intermittent episodes of somnolence and confusion, including inability to respond to questions, recurred. Laboratory studies revealed an ammonia level of 59 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 12 to 48), a lipase level of 260 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60), and an amylase level of 187 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. MRI of the liver (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F) with cholangiopancreatography, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, confirmed the presence of multiple ill-defined foci throughout the liver, with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appreciable enhancement, and also showed focal lesions of a similar appearance throughout the spleen.

The patient had been well until 6 years before the current evaluation, when she noted a mass in the superolateral quadrant of the left breast. Mammography that was performed at the time of the initial presentation, 6 years previously, revealed extremely dense breast tissue but was otherwise normal (Figure 1A and 1B). Targeted ultrasound evaluation of the palpable mass in the left breast revealed an irregular, hypoechoic mass, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 0.9 cm (Figure 1C), which was consistent with cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated, enhancing mass in the central superior left breast that measured 2.5 cm by 2.3 cm and had irregular margins (Figure 2A), which corresponded to the ultrasound finding and was consistent with cancer. No additional suspicious findings were seen in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the mass was performed. Imaging Studies Obtained at the Patient\u2019s Initial Presentation.Craniocaudal and mediolateral-oblique digital mammograms of the left breast (Panels A and B, respectively) show a radiopaque marker indicating a palpable lump; the breast tissue is extremely dense, and no mammographic abnormality is evident. An ultrasound image of the left breast (Panel C) shows an irregular, hypoechoic mass (2.0 cm in maximal dimension, indicated by plus signs) that corresponds to the palpable finding. Breast MRI Scans Obtained at the Initial Presentation and 6 Years Later.A fat-suppressed, T1-weighted image of the breasts that was obtained after the administration of gadolinium, at the initial presentation (Panel A), shows a lobulated, enhancing mass in the central superior left breast (circle) that measures 2.5 cm by 2.3 cm and has irregular margins; this finding correlates with the ultrasound finding and is consistent with cancer. An image of the breasts obtained on routine screening 6 years later (Panel B) shows post-treatment changes of the left breast and two enlarged, enhancing left internal mammary nodes, measuring 1.5 cm (circle) and 1.8 cm in maximal dimension. Pathological examination of the core-biopsy specimen revealed invasive carcinoma. A lumpectomy of the left breast, with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and subsequent axillary-lymph-node dissection, was performed. Examination of the lumpectomy specimen revealed a tannish-pink irregular mass, measuring 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 2 cm; on microscopic examination, the mass was composed of irregular nests of malignant epithelial cells infiltrating the stroma (Figure 3A). The tumor cells contained enlarged, atypical nuclei with distinct nucleoli and showed a moderate degree of mitotic activity (Figure 3B). The histologic features were those of a moderately differentiated, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (grade 2 of 3), with associated ductal carcinoma in situ (grade 2 to 3 of 3). There was extensive lymphatic invasion in the surrounding tissue (Figure 3C). One axillary sentinel lymph node had evidence of macrometastatic disease with extracapsular tumor extension, but an additional 10 axillary lymph nodes did not have evidence of cancer. The breast tumor was positive for estrogen receptor (ER), less than 1% positive for progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. The hormone-receptor (HR) status was consistent with a luminal B genetic subtype of breast carcinoma.1Invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ was located less than 0.2 cm from several margins. Reexcision was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed multiple foci of lymphatic invasion, with possible foci of stromal invasion located less than 0.05 cm from the surgical margin in the left lateral breast. Lumpectomy and Lymph-Node\u2013Biopsy Specimens (Hematoxylin and Eosin).At the initial presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. A lumpectomy specimen shows the tumor infiltrating the collagenous stroma and fat to form a confluent mass (Panel A, right side); the tumor grows in angulated nests and has enlarged, atypical nuclei (Panel B) and is present within a lymphatic vessel (Panel C). A specimen of a left internal mammary lymph node, obtained on fine-needle aspiration 6 years later, shows clusters of malignant cells that are similar in appearance to cells of the previous breast carcinoma (Panel D). A diagnosis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast was made. The disease was ER-positive, minimally PR-positive, and HER2-negative and had a clinical stage of T2\u2013N1\u2013M0 (according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer). A combination of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC chemotherapy) was administered for four cycles, followed by paclitaxel for four cycles, and the patient received radiation therapy (a total of 6000 cGy over a period of 5 weeks) to the left breast and supraclavicular region. Eight months after the diagnosis was made, anastrozole therapy was begun, along with routine serial surveillance with digital mammography (later in combination with tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography), alternating every 6 months with MRI of the breasts. After 5 years, anastrozole therapy was stopped. Five days before the current evaluation, routine MRI of both breasts was performed. Bilateral breast MRI, performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed stable post-treatment changes of the left breast and no abnormality of the right breast. However, since the last study, there had been development of two internal mammary lymph nodes of the left breast; they measured 1.5 cm by 1.0 cm and 1.8 cm by 1.0 cm (Figure 2B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed several indeterminate pulmonary nodules (4 to 5 mm in diameter) in the right lung and postsurgical changes in the left breast and axilla. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the liver that were consistent with benign cysts. A bone scan showed no evidence of skeletal metastases. A complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, and cancer antigen 15-3 and results of renal- and liver-function tests. The patient was referred to the cancer clinic of this hospital. Menarche had occurred at 13 years of age, and menopause at approximately 53 years of age. The patient had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years in her fourth decade. She had gastroesophageal reflux disease, osteopenia, and sciatica. Surgical procedures included resection of a stage IA melanoma (0.46 mm in greatest thickness) on the right arm 3 years before the current evaluation, of a melanoma in situ on the right calf 1 year before the current evaluation, and of squamous-cell and basal-cell carcinomas of the skin, as well as a myomectomy for fibroids. Medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D, and a calcium supplement. The patient had no known allergies. She was divorced, had no children, lived with a male partner, and worked in an office. She had stopped smoking 23 years earlier (after 20 pack-years), drank 1 to 2 alcoholic beverages per week, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had had hypertension and had died of heart disease in her late eighties, her father had dementia and emphysema, a paternal aunt had had breast cancer at 70 years of age and had died in her nineties, and a brother had metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus, ovarian cancer, or colon cancer. On examination, the skin of the left breast showed changes consistent with radiation exposure, without a dominant nodule. The examination was otherwise normal. Cytologic examination of a biopsy specimen of an enlarged internal mammary lymph node of the left breast, obtained on CT-guided fine-needle aspiration, revealed clusters of malignant cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei (Figure 3D). The cytologic features were similar to those of the patient\u2019s prior breast carcinoma, but the possibility of a metastasis from the patient\u2019s prior melanoma could not be entirely ruled out. The remaining tumor sample was insufficient for further diagnostic testing, and a diagnosis of a malignant epithelioid-cell neoplasm, most likely carcinoma, was made.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Nausea and fatigue persisted. Three months before admission, the patient was again evaluated by her primary care provider at the other hospital. The weight was 84.4 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm). Two and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hematology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis. Treatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital. In the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weakness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neuralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal syncope when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year without a clear cause. Medications included oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included diabetes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister. On examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis and coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue. On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A) revealed splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent positron-emission tomography with injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Figure 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton. Imaging Studies.A CT image of the abdomen (Panel A), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows moderate splenomegaly, with the spleen (S) measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension and with its inferior margin extending beyond the inferior margin of the liver (L). There are also gallstones (arrow) in the gallbladder. A maximum-intensity-projection positron-emission tomographic image with injection of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (Panel B) shows increased FDG uptake in the spleen, as compared with the liver, and diffuse FDG uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton. On hospital day 5, the patient reported a recurrence of severe fatigue and generalized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute.

Eight months before the current evaluation, at a physical examination performed for employment, the patient was told he had high blood pressure; no further evaluation was performed. One month before the current evaluation, he was seen by his primary care physician at another institution for a routine physical examination. A review of systems was reportedly negative. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/100 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the skin revealed a rash consistent with rosacea and a small cyst on the back; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of hemoglobin was 10.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 14.0 to 18.0), hematocrit 31.5% (normal range, 40.0 to 54.0), urea nitrogen 37 mg per deciliter (13.2 mmol per liter; normal range, 9 to 20 mg per deciliter [3.2 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), creatinine 3.1 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range, 0.7 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [62 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), potassium 4.5 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.5 to 5.1), albumin 3.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 3.3 to 5.0), and glucose 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; normal range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Amlodipine therapy was started. Six days later, dark urine developed. After 4 days, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported no dysuria, urinary frequency, obstructive urinary symptoms, antecedent trauma, or vigorous exercise. Examination was notable for a blood pressure of 148/100 mm Hg. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 46 mg per deciliter (16.4 mmol per liter), creatinine 3.5 mg per deciliter (309 \u03bcmol per liter), and potassium 5.7 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results were essentially unchanged from 10 days earlier. A urinalysis was notable for yellow, cloudy urine, with 3+ blood (normal value, negative), 3+ protein (normal value, negative), 0 to 5 erythrocytes per high-power field (normal range, <5), and 10 to 20 leukocytes per high-power field (normal range, <2). Urine was obtained for culture. The dose of amlodipine was increased. The patient was referred to the outpatient nephrology clinic of this hospital. At this hospital, the patient reported that he had had intermittent hematuria and episodic foamy urine during the previous 10 months. He had new pedal edema that was greater on the right side than on the left side. Since the last visit with his primary care physician approximately 2 weeks earlier, he had had 2 days of coryza but no other respiratory symptoms. There was no anorexia, weight change, pruritus, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, visual or auditory disturbances, headache, neurologic symptoms, or other bleeding symptoms. The medical history was notable for rosacea and childhood asthma. Medications included amlodipine. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was in a long-term monogamous relationship. He worked in maintenance but had not been exposed to inhaled chemicals or environmental allergens. He had not traveled outside Massachusetts. He drank three beers per week and had last smoked marijuana 10 years earlier; he had never used tobacco or other illicit drugs. There was a history of systemic hypertension in his paternal grandfather and a paternal aunt, as well as a history of cancer in multiple maternal relatives, including his mother, who had had brain cancer, and his maternal grandmother and a maternal aunt, who had had breast cancer. There was no known family history of kidney disease. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 71 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 160/102 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.2. There was 1+ pedal edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of liver-function tests, blood levels of creatine kinase and glycated hemoglobin, the international normalized ratio, and the prothrombin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1andTable 2. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigens and surface antibodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative. Examination of urine sediment revealed fine granular casts, dysmorphic red cells, and rare white-cell casts.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 weeks before this evaluation, when he noted while showering that the right testicle was approximately 3 times larger than the left testicle. The testicle was soft and nontender on palpation, and the enlargement had not been present the previous day. The next day, the patient was evaluated at a local urgent care clinic. He reported no trauma, heavy lifting, recent sexual intercourse, testicular or scrotal pain, abdominal or back pain, skin changes or rash, obstructive urinary symptoms, hematuria or dysuria, or discharge. He had no constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, the right testicle had a large, soft, mobile posterior mass; the left testicle was normal. A presumptive diagnosis of a hydrocele was made, and the patient was advised to use scrotal support and, if pain occurred, to take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Testicular ultrasonography was scheduled for the following day. The next day, ultrasonography (Figure 1) revealed marked asymmetric enlargement and hypervascularity of the right testicle. A hypoechoic region in the mediastinum testis was most likely related to edema due to infection or inflammation. The epididymis was also enlarged and hypervascular. An associated complex hydrocele, with septations and internal debris, was present on the right side. These findings were compatible with right epididymo-orchitis. The left testicle had normal echotexture and no focal lesion. There was an incidental left varicocele. Initial Ultrasound Images.A transverse ultrasound image of the scrotum shows asymmetric enlargement and edema of the right testicle (Panel A, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows asymmetric hypervascularity of the right testicle (Panel B, arrow). A sagittal ultrasound image of the right hemiscrotum shows enlargement of the right epididymis (Panel C, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows diffuse hypervascularity of the right testicle and epididymis (Panel D). A 10-day course of oral levofloxacin was prescribed. Six weeks later, at a follow-up visit with his primary care physician, the patient reported persistent testicular swelling. He noted that there had been a mild decrease in the swelling after he had completed the levofloxacin course but that the testicle continued to enlarge thereafter, causing inconvenience owing to its bulk and the pressure in the right groin, which made it difficult for him to sit and to flex his upper leg. There were no additional symptoms, such as pain or fever. The patient had long-standing benign prostatic hypertrophy with associated nocturia, as well as Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, mild normocytic anemia, peptic ulcer disease, colonic diverticulosis, hypercholesterolemia, hearing loss, and cataracts. An episode of syncope had occurred after exercise on a hot and humid day 3 years earlier, and he had undergone left inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh placement 13 years earlier. Medications were aspirin, omeprazole, tamsulosin, finasteride, nifedipine as needed for symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and pravastatin. The patient had no known allergies. He performed aerobic exercise daily. He was married, had no children, and had immigrated to the United States from Turkey when he was 20 years of age. He was a retired health care professional; he reported that he had had at least one negative tuberculin skin test in the past. More than 40 years earlier, he had smoked cigarettes for 5 years; he did not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He had traveled to Canada, Western Europe, and the Caribbean in the past. His mother had died in her 70s after a stroke, his father had lived beyond 90 years of age, a brother had prostatic hypertrophy, and a sister had multiple sclerosis. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the heart rate 54 beats per minute, the blood pressure 119/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.3. A firm, nontender right scrotal mass (7 cm in diameter) was located in the posterior region, protruding superiorly to the external inguinal ring. The mass transmitted light on transillumination. The scrotal skin was normal, with no erythema or peau d\u2019orange (orange peel) changes. The left testicle had changes consistent with a varicocele. The prostate was small and benign on palpation. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis showed yellow, clear urine, with a specific gravity of 1.011 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), a pH of 6.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0), and no evidence of leukocyte esterase or occult blood. A culture of the urine was sterile. Repeat testicular ultrasonography (Figure 2) revealed further enlargement of the right testicle. The right testicular volume was approximately 33 ml; it had been approximately 19 ml on an image obtained 6 weeks earlier. The hypoechoic region in the right mediastinum testis had increased in size. The right testicular parenchyma and epididymis remained hypervascular. Multiple new nonspecific hypoechoic areas were scattered throughout the remaining testicular parenchyma. The left testicle was normal. Additional Ultrasound Images.Repeat ultrasonography was performed approximately 6 weeks after the first ultrasound examination, at the time of the current evaluation. A transverse ultrasound image of the scrotum shows persistent asymmetric enlargement of the right testicle and worsening edema in the mediastinum testis (Panel A, arrow), and a corresponding color Doppler image shows persistent hypervascularity of the right testicle (Panel B, arrow).

The week before this presentation, the patient, who was a lawyer, had traveled alone to Mexico for vacation. His family reported that he seemed to be in his usual health before the trip but that, when they spoke with him by telephone while he was in Mexico (4 days before this presentation), he seemed euphoric and easily distracted, which were notable changes from baseline. They were then unable to reach him by telephone for 72 hours and became increasingly concerned about his well-being. Ultimately, he was reached by telephone; he was agitated and refused to board his scheduled return flight. The patient\u2019s mother traveled from the United States to Mexico, where she found the patient to be confused and unkempt and to have lost his wallet and passport; he was drinking alcohol and insisting that he needed to travel immediately to New York City to work on an important legal case. His mother escorted him on a flight back to the United States and brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, family members reported that the patient had begun having unexplained weight loss approximately 1 year earlier. The patient reported a history of multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers that had been treated with cryotherapy; he had also adopted a diet low in added sugar, which he believed had led to improvement in the appearance of the skin lesions. He had undergone sigmoidoscopy 12 years earlier to remove a foreign body from the sigmoid colon. He took melatonin and was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone in an urban area of New England, and frequently traveled to Mexico; he had sex with men and used condoms intermittently. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of dementia, stroke, seizure disorder, cancer, depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. On examination, the patient appeared thin and agitated. The temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to which city he was in and to the year but not the month. When he was asked why he was in the emergency department, his response revealed anosognosia and confabulation. He had nonfluent aphasia and perseverated when speaking, but he had no dysarthria and was able to repeat words, name objects and the current president, and pantomime brushing his hair and teeth. He performed simple calculations accurately but was unable to perform two-part commands; he was slow when he spelled \u201ctable\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d backward and when he counted down from 100 in increments of 7. He could not provide abstract explanations for proverbs. Examination of the function of cranial nerves II through XII revealed left-eye ptosis, a finding that was also visible on the patient\u2019s driver\u2019s license photograph, which had been taken in the remote past. There was intermittent twitching on the right side of the face. Pronator drift was present on the right side of the body; the motor examination was otherwise normal, as were examinations of sensation and deep-tendon reflexes. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger movements were smooth and accurate bilaterally after the patient understood the task. The stance and stride were normal, but the patient walked slowly and was unable to walk with a tandem gait or on his toes or heels. The Romberg test was negative. Examination of the skin revealed a purple-brown scaly papule (0.5 cm in diameter) on the medial left knee (Figure 1A), a nonblanching purple-brown patch (1.5 cm in diameter) on the medial aspect of the left palmar foot (Figure 1B), and purple macules on the hard and soft palates. There were also multiple erythematous scars, including one on the left arm with an area of hard scale at the periphery; a red plaque (3 cm in diameter) on the chest with heaped-up central scale, hemorrhagic crust, and purulent discharge; a red plaque (4 cm in diameter) on the left flank with focal areas of scale and brown crust; gritty papules on the face; a large scaly red plaque on the back; and flaky scale on the scalp. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin. Urinalysis showed 1+ leukocyte esterase, 1+ bacteria, a pH of 6.0, and a specific gravity of 1.014; there were 3 to 5 red cells and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field. Urine and blood toxicology screens were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Clinical Photographs of Skin Lesions.Panel A shows a purple-brown scaly papule (0.5 cm in diameter) on the medial left knee, and Panel B shows a nonblanching purple-brown patch (1.5 cm in diameter) on the medial aspect of the left palmar foot. Photographs courtesy of Computed tomography of the head revealed ill-defined hypodensities in the white matter of the frontal lobes, which extended into the genu of the corpus callosum, and in the posterior periventricular white matter (Figure 2A). There was also an extraaxial calcification (4 cm in diameter) overlying the right frontal lobe that was thought to possibly represent a partially calcified meningioma (Figure 2B). CT Scan of the Head.An axial image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows abnormal hypodensities that involve the subcortical and deep white matter and most prominently involve the frontal lobes (Panel A). A coronal image shows an extraaxial calcified mass adjacent to the right frontal lobe that most likely represents a calcified meningioma (Panel B, arrow). Six hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, he had a 2-minute episode of aphasia. The temperature was 38.2\u00b0C. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and levetiracetam were administered intravenously, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 3). T2-weighted images showed an abnormal hyperintense signal in the frontoparietal white matter that was slightly more prominent in the right frontal lobe than in the left frontal lobe and that extended into the genu of the corpus callosum; there was no local mass effect or abnormal restricted diffusion. There was also a small exophytic hypointense lesion along the inner table of the right frontal bone that was suggestive of a small calcified meningioma, as well as mild bilateral prominence of the parotid glands, which had restricted diffusion. MRI of the Head.An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows abnormal increased signal in the subcortical and deep white matter that predominantly involves the frontal lobes (Panel A). These abnormalities correspond to those seen on the CT scan. An axial, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted image obtained at the level of the lateral ventricles shows no abnormal contrast enhancement (Panel B). After the MRI, the patient had another 2-minute witnessed episode, during which he was staring, twitching, and unable to speak; afterward, he seemed to be more confused than he had been previously. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 9 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, without xanthochromia. Examination of the CSF revealed 4 red cells and 7 white cells per microliter, a white-cell differential count of 80% lymphocytes and 20% monocytes, a protein level of 97 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and a glucose level of 53 mg per deciliter (2.9 mmol per liter [reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter; 2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). Gram\u2019s staining revealed moderate mononuclear cells, very rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and no organisms. The patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when he awoke with a severe, diffuse, pounding headache. He noted that the pain was similar to pain he had had in association with the malfunction of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt 24 years earlier. The patient took ibuprofen but had no symptom relief. Fevers, anorexia, fatigue, and mild nausea also developed. The evening before admission, he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On evaluation, the patient rated his headache as 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On examination, the temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared well, and the findings on a general physical examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which tunneled across the vertex and inferiorly down the left side of the scalp, without an apparent reservoir, and terminated just superior to the third ventricle. There was no evidence of hydrocephalus; the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles were not apparent, and the right lateral ventricle had a prominent temporal horn that abutted a region of temporo-occipital hypodensity and encephalomalacia. In addition, a series of radiographs, which were obtained to assess the position and function of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, revealed several remnants of the shunt catheter in the left thorax, as well as a large mass in the right hilum. Acetaminophen was administered orally, and normal saline, fentanyl, and ondansetron were administered intravenously. The following day, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further treatment. While the patient was in the ambulance, his temperature rose to 39.2\u00b0C and the headache persisted. Morphine was administered. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported that the severity of his headache had decreased. Several weeks earlier, he had not passed an eye examination for a driver\u2019s license because of poor peripheral vision. He had Tourette\u2019s syndrome and a cyst of the posterior fossa that was associated with hydrocephalus, which had been managed with ventriculoperitoneal shunting since childhood. He had undergone five shunt revisions; the most recent had been performed 24 years earlier because of shunt malfunction. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his girlfriend in New England, where he was employed in the shipbuilding industry; he enjoyed spending time outdoors and worked part-time as a nature guide. He was monogamous with his girlfriend, drank an average of four beers weekly, and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. He had not recently traveled outside New England and had no known exposure to sick persons or tick bites. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 39.2\u00b0C, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/79 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Left homonymous hemianopsia was present; the remainder of the general examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Morphine and lorazepam were administered intravenously, and a lumbar puncture was performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, with a protein level of 124 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and with three nucleated cells and no blood cells per microliter. Gram\u2019s staining did not reveal any microorganisms; a specimen was sent for bacterial culture. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On physical examination the following morning, nontender lymphadenopathy was noted in the cervical, postauricular, supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. The spleen was not enlarged, and the temperature ranged from 36.4\u00b0C to 38.0\u00b0C. The examination was otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine, with a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 5.0, and 2+ urobilinogen by dipstick. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear for parasites was negative. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed several well-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic lesions abutting the pancreatic head that were thought to represent enlarged lymph nodes, as well as an exophytic, hypoechoic lesion (2 cm in diameter) at the lower pole of the left kidney. A single-view radiograph of the chest (Figure 1A) showed a fragmented ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter on the left side. In addition, there was widening of the mediastinum and bilateral hilar nodular thickening. These findings are consistent with underlying mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Imaging Studies.A single-view radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows a fragmented left ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter, as well as mediastinal widening and bilateral hilar nodular thickening (arrows); these findings are consistent with underlying mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Contrast-enhanced CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained. Axial images of the chest (Panels B, C, and D) show mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving the prevascular and right paratracheal regions (Panel B, arrowheads), lymphadenopathy involving the right lower paratracheal and aortopulmonary regions (Panel C, arrowhead), volume loss of the right middle lobe, and consolidation due to right hilar lymphadenopathy, which partially narrows the bronchus intermedius and partially obstructs the bronchus of the right middle lobe (Panel D, arrow). A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel E) shows extensive retroperitoneal and left inguinal lymphadenopathy (arrowheads), and axial images (Panels F and G) show retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, infiltrative left renal lesions (Panel F, arrow), and left external iliac lymphadenopathy (Panel G, arrow). Subsequently, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material (Figure 1B through 1G). Axial images of the chest obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy involving several nodal stations, including the prevascular, aortopulmonary, right paratracheal, and right lower paratracheal regions. Images of the chest obtained with the lung window setting showed volume loss of the right middle lobe and atelectasis due to right hilar lymphadenopathy, which partially narrows the bronchus intermedius and partially obstructs the bronchus of the right middle lobe. A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis obtained with a soft-tissue window setting showed extensive retroperitoneal and left inguinal lymphadenopathy, and axial images showed retroperitoneal and left external iliac lymphadenopathy and infiltrative left renal lesions. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were stopped. The headache persisted, and fevers continued. Morphine and acetaminophen were administered, and the patient had symptom relief. On the third hospital day, the patient continued to feel unwell and had night sweats. Fevers to a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C continued. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Manual review of the peripheral-blood smear by a hematopathologist was requested, and flow cytometry was performed. Examination of the peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C) revealed atypical polymorphous lymphoid cells with round-to-irregular nuclei, some with nucleoli, and moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm; a few cytoplasmic granules were present in some of the cells. Plasmacytoid lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells were also present; no blasts were seen. Some neutrophils appeared to be hypogranulated, and large platelets were present. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed a differential count of 35% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, and 54% granulocytes, as well as 3% polyclonal B cells, 27% CD3+ T cells (with no immunophenotypic abnormalities), 4% natural killer (NK) cells, 1.5% CD3+CD16+CD57+CD8+ T cells, and no myeloid or lymphoid blasts. There was a markedly inverted ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells of 0.08 (Figure 2D). Peripheral-Blood Smear and Flow Cytometry.Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of a peripheral-blood smear shows polymorphous lymphocytes with oval-to-irregular nuclei, some with small nucleoli (Panel A), and moderate-to-abundant cytoplasm. Some cells have plasmacytoid differentiation, with clumped nuclear chromatin, eccentric nuclei, and a paranuclear hof (Panel B). Occasional cells contain cytoplasmic granules (Panel C). Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood (Panel D) shows that the lymphocytes are mostly CD3+CD8+ T cells (arrow) with a markedly inverted CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.08 and intact expression of the pan\u2013T-cell antigens CD2, CD5, and CD7 (not shown).

The patient was in his usual health, with a history of prostate cancer, until approximately 2 months before admission, when urinary frequency and urgency developed. On digital rectal examination at another hospital, the prostate gland was normal. The blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.07 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 4.0 ng per milliliter). Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Five weeks before admission, he saw his primary care provider for routine follow-up; the physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Shortly thereafter, pain in a left lower tooth developed, with numbness of the face and jaw on the lower left side. His dentist prescribed 10 days of amoxicillin, but symptoms persisted. One month before admission, his dentist performed a root canal on a left lower molar, which was completed 10 days before admission. Nine days before admission, the patient returned to his internist; he reported persistent numbness of the lower lip and chin bilaterally, with shooting pain into the area of the left ear. On examination, cranial nerves II through XII were normal; there was slightly decreased sensation to light touch over the chin and lower lip bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory Data. Eight days before admission, cystoscopy was performed at the other hospital, with resection of an identified bladder tumor. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly revealed low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, associated with inflammation. After the procedure, the patient's family reported that he was depressed, with increasing lethargy, weakness, and anorexia. Two days later, extraction of the left lower molar was performed because of presumed infection. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of the other hospital because of persistent hematuria, dysuria, and night sweats. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and the physical examination were normal. Test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood (3+), protein (2+), and nitrites. A urine culture was sterile. Narcotic analgesia and ciprofloxacin were begun, and he returned home. On the morning of admission, his wife noted increasing confusion, and his family brought him to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient had hypertension, mitral-valve prolapse, and a history of carcinoma of the prostate (Gleason score of 6 [on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis]) that had been treated with brachytherapy 10 years earlier; PSA levels remained normal after therapy. He had had nephrolithiasis decades earlier and a hip replacement. Medications included ciprofloxacin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, phenazopyridine, dutasteride, tamsulosin, and aspirin (81 mg daily). He had no known allergies. He was married, lived with his wife, and worked in an office. He exercised daily and did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had died of lung cancer at 59 years of age, and his mother at 89 years of age from \u201cnatural causes\u201d; a brother had prostate cancer and alcoholism. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable, and oriented to person and time. The temperature was 36.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 140/61 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy and no palpable organomegaly. There was trace edema in both legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, troponin I, and cardiac isoenzymes were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation; other results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood (2+), protein (1+), and nitrites. There was no occult blood in the stool. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed a wandering atrial pacemaker with occasional nonconducted P waves, a ventricular rate of 91 beats per minute, first-degree atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular complexes; the rhythm was new as compared with 2 weeks earlier. In the emergency department, the patient's temperature rose to 38.3\u00b0C. Specimens of blood and urine were cultured. Metronidazole, cefepime, vancomycin, dalteparin, magnesium sulfate, and acetaminophen were administered, as well as intravenous normal saline and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was admitted to this hospital. Ultrasonography of the kidneys revealed left hydronephrosis and a cyst in the left upper pole. On the second day, computed tomography (CT) of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, was unchanged from previous studies. Testing forClostridium difficiletoxin in the stool was negative. On the third day, CT scans of the chest and abdomen were obtained after the administration of contrast material. CT images of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B) show right axillary lymphadenopathy, a subcarinal mass (5.6 cm in diameter), and superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy, all showing heterogeneous enhancement. CT images of the abdomen (Figure 1C and 1D) show extensive mesenteric, retroperitoneal, periceliac, peripancreatic, periportal, bilateral iliac, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Left hydroureteronephrosis is a result of obstruction by left-sided pelvic lymphadenopathy. In the left kidney is an enhancing, exophytic, lobulated mass, 2.5 cm in diameter. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. CT Images.CT of the chest after the administration of contrast material shows enlarged right axillary lymph nodes (Panel A, arrows) and a subcarinal mass (Panel B, arrowhead). An axial image from an abdominal CT scan (Panel C) shows mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads) and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (arrow). A coronal image from the abdominal CT (Panel D) shows an exophytic mass in the left kidney (arrowhead) and left hydronephrosis resulting from obstructive pelvic lymphadenopathy. The patient's mental status improved, and the temperature returned to normal. During the next 6 days, drenching sweats occurred daily. Hypercalcemia resolved, cultures of the blood were sterile, and the administration of antibiotics was stopped. Additional test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device. Three months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a second vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen. Eight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot revealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third metatarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was recommended, but the patient\u2019s pain did not abate after these treatments. Initial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.A radiograph of the right foot obtained 8 months before admission (Panel A) shows a nondisplaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow). A radiograph of the right foot obtained 7 months before admission (Panel B) again shows a nondisplaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow), as well as new minimally displaced fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (arrowheads). Long-axis T2-weighted fat-suppressed images from MRI of the right foot performed 3 months before admission (Panels C and D) show a new nondisplaced fracture of the distal second metatarsal (Panel C, arrow) with associated bone marrow edema (Panel C, asterisk) and surrounding soft-tissue edema (Panel C, arrowheads). There is also a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform (Panel D, arrow) and previously identified fractures of the distal third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals (Panel D, arrowheads) with minimal bone marrow edema. A T2-weighted fat-suppressed coronal image from MRI of the sacrum performed on admission (Panel E) shows vertically oriented stress fractures of the bilateral sacral alae (arrows) with surrounding bone marrow edema (asterisks). A T2-weighted fat-suppressed sagittal image of the sacrum (Panel F) shows a horizontally oriented fracture through S2 (arrowhead). Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the right foot (Figure 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals. Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography. Four months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9) and in the femoral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended. The pain in the right foot persisted, and additional imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Three months before admission, MRI of the right foot (Figure 1C and 1D) showed a nondisplaced fracture of the second metatarsal metadiaphysis with associated bone and soft-tissue edema, a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform, and healing fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation. During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain developed in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syndrome were considered. Treatment with methylprednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The patient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet. Menarche had occurred when the patient was 11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of fractures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admission), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and difficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthritis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the legs (4/5). There was tenderness over the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19. During the following week, the patient\u2019s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with remdesivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range. During the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and instead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexamethasone. One day after discharge, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone. He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hospital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and overwhelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; thereafter, she had been discharged to a partial hospital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angioedema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emigrated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her father. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radiograph of the chest were normal. Treatment with dexamethasone was stopped, and the patient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for continued care. On hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d The patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she responded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were perseverative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, attention, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and released, they fell to the bed without resistance; with encouragement, she was able to move them. Muscle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter. CT of the Head.An axial image, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows no evidence of an acute territorial infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There is moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter (arrow). Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recommended. During the next week, while awaiting placement in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window.

Twenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 6.0 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value, <54). Blood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative. Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Figure 1A and 1B). In addition, there was trace ascites (Figure 1B). Initial Imaging Studies.Thirteen years before the current presentation, CT enterography of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material. Axial and coronal reconstruction images (Panels A and B, respectively) show diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel (Panels A and B, arrows) and trace interloop ascites (Panel B, arrowhead). On the current presentation, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material. Axial images (Panels C through F) show multiple new hypoenhancing focal liver lesions (Panels C and D, arrows), diffuse small-bowel mural thickening and hyperenhancement (Panel E, arrow) similar to the findings seen on the previous study, moderate-volume ascites (Panel E, arrowhead), and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Panel F, arrow). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued. Eleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema persisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnormalities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thickening of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy \u2014 which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stockings \u2014 was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occasionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdominal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and imaging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen. Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.

On the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. There was no history of recurrent infections, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer. The physical examination was limited, because the evaluation was done in a video conference in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdominal and pelvic nodes (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reliable percutaneous sampling were at the far cranial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respiratory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasonographically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the dependent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1F). Tests for hepatitis C virus antibodies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were negative. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. An acid-fast stain of a concentrated specimen of ascitic fluid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no malignant cells. A fluoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also performed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg. Histologic examination of the liver-biopsy specimen revealed mild mixed portal inflammation and grade 1 steatosis without steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain showed mild portal tract edema but no fibrosis. Mycobacterial cultures of the ascitic fluid were negative.

The patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, frequency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake. There was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she reported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levothyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grandfather. On examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on palpation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was normal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Figure 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free fluid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position. Imaging Studies.A sagittal ultrasound image (Panel A) shows a hypoechoic mass (arrow) posterior to the right lobe of the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a mass arising from the right adrenal gland that is isointense on a T2-weighted image (Panel B, arrow) and has diffusion restriction on a diffusion-weighted image (Panel C, arrow). Computed tomographic images obtained before the administration of contrast material (Panel D), during the portal-venous phase (Panel E), and during the 15-minute delayed phase (Panel F) show the density of the mass (arrows and dashed circles); the absolute washout is 71%. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by 4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Figure 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Figure 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adrenal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Figure 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Figure 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute delayed phase (Figure 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is calculated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed-phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a percentage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unenhanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an absolute washout of more than 60% is highly suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, regardless of the washout characteristics.1There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung. The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional laboratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldosterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to 16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.

The patient had been well until 10 weeks before admission, when a violaceous rash developed involving the eyelids, elbows, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, and knees. One week later, intense generalized muscle pain and weakness developed, including difficulty walking, arising from a squat, and climbing stairs. Two weeks later, examination at another hospital revealed a heliotrope rash (a red-to-purple rash on the eyelids), periungual edema, erythematous papules on the fingertips, and moderate-to-severe weakness of the deltoids, triceps, hip flexors, hamstrings, and quadriceps bilaterally. Muscle bulk and tone, deep-tendon reflexes, and the sensory examination were normal. Electrodiagnostic studies of muscle and nerve reportedly showed evidence of a chronic proximal myopathy with inflammatory features. Prednisone, 80 mg daily, was administered, with transient improvement in weakness and a reported decrease in the serum creatine kinase level, from 6700 U per liter to 4200 U per liter. Twenty-six days before admission, the administration of azathioprine, 150 mg per day, was begun because of the patient's progressive weakness (including difficulty raising his arms) and tenderness on deep palpation of the proximal limbs. Two days later, tests of coagulation and the blood level of total bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Azathioprine was stopped after 2 days because of a rise in the creatine kinase level, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed a small left pleural effusion and anasarca. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed after the administration of gadolinium reportedly revealed enhancement and edema throughout the major muscle groups of the right thigh. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of skeletal muscle reportedly revealed mildly increased variation in fiber size and occasional degenerating fibers, myonecrosis, vascular injury, and fibrosis. Rituximab and a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. Anemia and hypertension reportedly developed. Red cells (6 units) were transfused and antihypertensive agents were administered. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow showed normal trilineage hematopoiesis and no malignant cells. Fever developed, and a possible pulmonary infiltrate was seen on chest radiographs; vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered. On the 19th day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital. He had progressive weakness and was unable to ambulate. During the next 5 days, worsening cough and increasing sputum production developed. On the fifth day, a modified barium-swallow examination reportedly revealed aspiration of thin liquids. Oral intake was stopped and a nasogastric tube placed. The next morning, respiratory distress developed while the patient was in a supine position; the oxygen saturation decreased to 68% while he was breathing ambient air (from a previous level of \u226590%). A chest radiograph reportedly revealed air-space disease in the left lower lobe and a small, left-sided pleural effusion. Furosemide, vancomycin, piperacillin and tazobactam in combination, transdermal nitroglycerin ointment, and oxygen were administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included hydralazine, fondaparinux, cyclobenzaprine, furosemide, metoprolol, and methylprednisolone. The patient had had a meniscal repair 10 years earlier. He was married and lived with his wife and two young children and worked in a service industry. He did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension, and two aunts had hypothyroidism; there was no family history of muscle, skin, or other autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 175/90 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing oxygen that was administered through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute. Breath sounds were diminished at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. There were erythematous papules on the extensor surfaces of the fingers, elbows, and knees and a heliotrope rash bilaterally. Nontender erythema of the periungual regions was present. There was pitting edema of the arms and legs. Grip strength and the strength of foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 4\u2212/5, and the patient was unable to lift his arms, legs, or head against gravity (2+/5). Red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of globulin, total and direct bilirubin, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, and CA 19-9; direct and indirect Coombs' tests and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Normal saline, metronidazole, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin were administered. CT performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol showed air-space opacities and diffuse stranding in the superficial soft tissues, with no evidence of embolism. In the evening on the day of admission, hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure developed (Table 1). The patient was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. During the next 2 weeks, a tracheostomy was performed and the patient was weaned from respiratory support to nocturnal pressure-support ventilation. Serum immunoglobulin levels and protein electrophoresis were normal. Examination of a specimen from a second muscle biopsy of the right quadriceps muscle showed tubuloreticular inclusions within endothelial cells, atrophy of type 2B fibers, and a small area of inflammation. A second 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin was administered. Stools became guaiac-positive; endoscopic examination revealed two gastric ulcers, which were cauterized. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the lesions showed no malignant cells or dysplasia. Testing forHelicobacter pyloriwas positive; metronidazole and clarithromycin in a 14-day course and a proton-pump inhibitor were administered. Red cells were transfused intermittently, the levels of creatine kinase returned to normal, and the dose of prednisone was tapered to 7.5 mg daily. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation hospital on the 50th day, breathing 40% oxygen through the tracheostomy with a tracheostomy mask during the day and receiving pressure-support ventilation at night. He was able to sit on the edge of a bed with assistance and was lifted to a chair for chair rest. Prednisone was continued at 7.5 mg per day, and the monthly administration of intravenous immunoglobulin was planned. Seven weeks after discharge from this hospital, and approximately 6 months after the onset of symptoms, new erythematous macules and papules appeared on the torso, extremities, and face. Examination of the trunk, limbs, and face revealed discrete, erythematous macules and papules that were too numerous to count (Figure 1). These lesions were characterized by central, white, atrophic and sclerotic centers, violaceous borders, and peripheral hyperpigmentation. Clinical Photographs of the Patient.Panel A shows the patient's forehead, with multiple small, white, atrophic and crusted papules with violaceous borders.

The patient had been born to a 23-year-old primigravida mother after 40 weeks of uncomplicated gestation. His mother noted that he had intensely blue sclerae at birth; physical examination was otherwise normal. The patient's postnatal course was normal, and he was discharged home. When he was approximately 1 year of age, mild delays in speech and gross motor development were noted by his parents and pediatrician, including weakness of the leg muscles and poor body control. He began walking at 16 to 17 months of age and shortly thereafter had the first of multiple fractures. He had had more than 12 fractures before he started school, and approximately 20 fractures before he was 10 years of age; these fractures resulted from minor trauma, twisting injuries, falls, and collisions that occurred during typical childhood daily activities and play. During early childhood, mild cognitive impairment and speech difficulties were diagnosed and speech therapy was initiated. By the time he started elementary school, his language development had reportedly \u201ccaught up\u201d with that of his peers, and he did not require additional speech therapy. He reportedly had mild cognitive challenges in school, for which he was granted extra time on tests and received special-education services, but he attended mainstream classes and graduated from high school. Ankle tendon\u2013release surgery was performed during childhood to improve the range of motion; contracture of the left ankle persisted. Physical therapy was performed. A bone-mineral-density (BMD) assessment performed in childhood was reportedly normal. An evaluation by a geneticist at another hospital during the patient's early childhood reportedly showed no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities. There was a clinical suspicion of the fragile X syndrome, but definitive testing was not available at the time. When he was in his 20s, the patient began participating in a sports activity program for youth with disabilities, and fractures occurred with an increased frequency; he had had a total of approximately 30 fractures by the time he was 27 years of age. Fractures predominantly involved the ribs, hands, feet, and ankles and did not include fractures of the long bones or compression fractures. Laboratory evaluation for secondary osteoporosis, performed at a second hospital, was reportedly negative. Four months before this evaluation, BMD assessment with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) revealed severe osteoporosis. The next month, a 24-hour urine collection contained 120 mg (3 mmol) of calcium and a normal level of creatinine; other test results are shown inTable 1. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, a bone scan performed at another hospital reportedly showed increased technetium uptake in two ribs on the left side, as well as in the right ankle, left hindfoot, and midshaft of both tibias, findings that were thought to represent fractures. He was referred to the endocrinology clinic at this hospital. Laboratory Blood-Test Data. The medical history was obtained from the patient and his mother. He had asymptomatic hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and vitiligo. He reported pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), \u201cmuscle cramps\u201d in his groin and knees on weight-bearing, occasional pain in his upper body, and occasional palpitations. In the past, he had had bleeding and infections of his toenails after self-induced trauma, as well as acid reflux. He had no history of hearing loss, joint dislocations, nephrolithiasis, eating disorders, lactose intolerance, or celiac disease. Medications included vitamin D3, atorvastatin, and levothyroxine sodium. He had no known allergies. His diet included dairy products (one or two glasses of milk daily and several servings of cheese per week) and two to three cans of carbonated soft drinks daily. He exercised with light weights and a stationary bike; walking was occasionally limited by leg pain. He lived with his parents and a sibling, had graduated from a community college with an associate's degree, and worked part-time in a service industry. He had casual social contacts through various hobbies. Although he had a few good friends in high school, he was \u201cnot very social\u201d as an adult. He spent time in his room playing online games, worrying, and picking his toenails, which he described as an obsessive behavior. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother was of French Canadian and Native American ancestry and his father of Dutch and English ancestry. His maternal aunt had osteoporosis and had multiple fractures after 45 years of age after falls, his father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his maternal grandmother and uncles had diabetes mellitus type 2, and his sisters were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 125/86 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the height 167 cm (9th percentile), the weight 70 kg (70th percentile), the head circumference 56 cm (73rd percentile), and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.1. The patient looked older than his stated age and had a prominent forehead, lower jaw, and nasal bridge, as well as a thickened nose and receded hairline. The teeth were short, wide-spaced, and discolored (not opalescent), with some periodontal disease, and the palate and uvula were normal. The sclerae were pale blue. There was slight central obesity, some muscle wasting of extremities, and normal virilization and testes. The small joints of the hands and fingers had notable laxity, with a score of 2 out of 9 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility (the two fifth digits could each dorsiflex more than 90 degrees); the large joints were mildly contracted. There were patches of vitiligo, as well as hyperpigmentation that was consistent with sun exposure, with no pigmented striae or bruising. He had truncal hypotonia, mild kyphosis, and no scoliosis or vertebral tenderness.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria. Three weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without rebound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vaginal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomonads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab forChlamydia trachomatisandNeisseria gonorrhoeaewere negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies toC. trachomatisserovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metronidazole gel was prescribed. Two days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units (CFU) ofEscherichia coliper milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU ofKlebsiella pneumoniaeper milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed. The inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroidism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intrauterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for migraines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England during the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote locations. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only minimal contact with her aunt. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient appeared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guarding. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

One week before admission, the patient had accepted placement in a homeless shelter, after spending the previous 4 years sleeping in a public building. During that time, she had repeatedly declined assistance from outreach workers in finding shelter; she maintained that it was her mission from God to stay outside and watch over people. On evaluation at the shelter, she was disheveled and had disorganized speech and thought content that was focused on spiritual themes. She attributed her impairments to a traumatic brain injury that she had incurred in a motor vehicle accident more than 12 years earlier. She did not think she had a psychiatric illness and refused psychiatric medications but agreed to see an on-site primary care internist at the shelter. A limited physical examination revealed extensive tinea pedis and venous stasis dermatitis of the legs. On the morning of admission, the patient reported a severe headache that had begun the night before. She permitted a nurse to measure her vital signs; the blood pressure was 180/110 mm Hg. Emergency medical services were called; on evaluation, the systolic blood pressure measured 212 mm Hg. She was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported feeling \u201coff\u201d and intermittently said she had a frontal headache; she did not report visual symptoms, chest or abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and a psychotic illness of more than 12 years\u2019 duration that was characterized by somatic, paranoid, grandiose delusions, a disorganized thought process, and poor self-care. Five years before this admission, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital; as an inpatient, she had brief symptomatic improvement while she was receiving olanzapine. After discharge, she did not pursue follow-up psychiatric care or continue to take olanzapine. She had taken hydrochlorothiazide 4 years before this admission but currently took no medications; she reported an allergy to nifedipine, which had caused palpitations. She was born in a Caribbean country and had immigrated to the northeastern United States many years earlier. She smoked intermittently and did not use illicit drugs but reported being injected in the thigh with an unknown substance in the past. The family history was unknown. On examination, the patient was obese, malodorous, disheveled, and wearing multiple layers of clothing. The blood pressure was 208/118 mm Hg; a repeat measurement was 240/130 mm Hg. The pulse was 95 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a systolic ejection murmur (grade 1/6) at the right upper sternal border, without rub or gallop. Both legs had 2+ pitting edema to the knees, with changes related to chronic stasis and thickening of the skin. The patient\u2019s attitude was pleasant and cooperative; eye contact was good, with no abnormal movements. Her speech had a low volume and a fast rate. She described her mood as \u201cfine,\u201d and she appeared to be euthymic, with a blunted affect. Her thought process was disorganized, and the content included hyperreligious and grandiose delusions. She reported auditory hallucinations involving the voices of God and Satan, as well as \u201cvisions\u201d that she believed were messages from God. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation; her insight and judgment were poor. The remainder of the general examination was normal. The white-cell and differential counts, results of renal-function and coagulation tests, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, troponin T, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide, vitamin B12, and folate. Tests for troponin I and urinary human chorionic gonadotropin were negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (obtained without the administration of contrast material) were all normal. Intravenous labetalol and oral captopril were administered; the blood pressure decreased to 187/111 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Laboratory Data. Additional doses of labetalol and captopril were administered, as were acetaminophen, dalteparin, ferrous sulfate, omeprazole, folic acid, thiamine, and a multivitamin. The blood pressure decreased to 141/65 mm Hg in the left arm and 141/62 mm Hg in the right arm, and the headache gradually resolved. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. The patient declined an influenza vaccination. She was discharged to the shelter on the third hospital day, with a plan to receive blood-pressure monitoring on site. Medications on discharge were lisinopril, thiamine, a multivitamin, folate, omeprazole, and ferrous sulfate. The patient was advised to follow up in the medical walk-in clinic in 1 week.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was discharged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative. Two weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonproductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swimming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. The patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not available. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125).

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly revealed pericardial and pleural effusions and multifocal lung opacities but no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Point-of-care ultrasonography reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furosemide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital. On arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pressure. A family member accompanying the patient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months before the current presentation, she had had asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping. Other medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of cardiac or autoimmune disease. The temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting in an upright position, she had increased work of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decrescendo diastolic murmur at the base that radiated to the apex, without an S3gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyrotropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. An ECG (Figure 1A) showed sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B through 1FandVideos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic regurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement. There was a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade. Cardiac Studies.An electrocardiogram obtained at the time of the current presentation (Panel A) shows sinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1through V4, and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. On transthoracic echocardiography performed at the time of the current presentation, a parasternal long-axis view (Panel B) shows a dilated left ventricle (LV) and thickening of the aortic-root walls (arrow). A parasternal short-axis view of the aortic root (Panel C) shows a tricuspid aortic valve (AV) and thickening of the aortic-root walls (arrows). An apical five-chamber view (Panel D) shows a very large jet of severe aortic regurgitation (arrow). A suprasternal notch view with color Doppler (Panel E) shows holodiastolic flow reversal (arrow) in the descending thoracic aorta (DA). Continuous-wave Doppler tracing in the same suprasternal notch view (Panel F) confirms holodiastolic flow reversal (arrow), a finding that suggests severe aortic regurgitation. AA denotes aortic arch, AO aortic root, LA left atrium, RPA right pulmonary artery, and RV right ventricle. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 2) showed an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions. CT Angiography of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.CT angiography was performed at the time of the current presentation. A curved planar reformatted image obtained during the arterial phase (Panel A) shows an irregular contour of the descending aorta (yellow bracket). Maximum-intensity-projection images (Panels B and C) show luminal narrowing of partially visualized vessels of the aortic arch, including a mild focal stenosis of the innominate artery and diffuse narrowing of the proximal bilateral common carotid arteries (severe on the right side and mild to moderate on the left side) (Panel B, arrows); a severe focal stenosis is seen in the right renal artery (Panel C, arrow). Axial images obtained during the arterial phase (Panels D, E, and F) show circumferential wall thickening in the aorta at the root (Panel D, arrow) and in the ascending segment (Panel E, arrow). Circumferential wall thickening is also present in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch (Panel F, arrows). An axial image obtained during the venous phase (Panel G) shows circumferential wall thickening in the abdominal aorta (arrow) and corresponding mural enhancement.", "true_dx": "Takayasu\u2019s arteritis.", "pred_dx": "Takayasu arteritis", "correct": true, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a young woman who suddenly starts having trouble breathing and has some pretty concerning symptoms like a rapid heartbeat and low blood pressure.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's definitely alarming.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And then there's the fact that she's got these murmurs and weird heart rhythms showing up on the ECG.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, something's definitely off with her heart.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, looking at the echocardiogram, it seems like her heart's not pumping well, and there's severe aortic regurgitation.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That means the aortic valve isn't closing properly, causing blood to leak backward into the heart.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, there's more.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The aorta itself looks thickened and narrowed, especially around the root and the branches coming off it.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's unusual and makes me think we're dealing with something beyond just a valve issue.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and there's the CT scan.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It shows similar thickening and narrowing in the aorta and its branches.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, there's this enhancement suggesting inflammation.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a big clue pointing towards inflammation affecting the aorta.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, we might be looking at some kind of vasculitis here.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's piece this together.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a young person with sudden heart issues, aortic regurgitation, and signs of inflammation in the aorta.", "t": 5, "c": "2", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This really screams Takayasu arteritis to me.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's a type of large vessel vasculitis that can cause exactly these kinds of problems.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, putting it all together, I'm thinking Takayasu arteritis is the most likely explanation for what's happening.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It fits with the symptoms, the imaging findings, and the way everything's presenting.", "t": 5, "c": "2", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Yeah, that makes sense.", "t": 5, "c": "11", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "## Final Response", "t": 5, "c": "11", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}]}, {"id": "dfa32d028f082d978149d2633a2c8bf3", "qid": 184, "prompt": "A 47-year-old woman presented to this hospital early during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), because of cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when intermittent nonproductive cough and wheezing developed. She had no fever, chills, or shortness of breath. Two days before this evaluation, the cough worsened in frequency and severity and new shortness of breath developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician by telephone call. Humidification, fluticasone nasal spray, and fexofenadine were recommended, as was a follow-up telephone call in 2 weeks. However, the next day, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening shortness of breath with ambulation. A review of systems was notable for rhinorrhea, myalgias, and dizziness. She had no fever, chills, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, leg swelling, or weight loss. The patient had a history of eczema and gestational diabetes. Medications included azelastine nasal spray, fluocinonide cream, folate, and ferrous sulfate; she had not yet begun to use the fluticasone nasal spray and fexofenadine that had been newly recommended by her primary care physician. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was originally from the equatorial region of South America and had moved to the United States 20 years earlier; she had not traveled outside the United States in many years. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her husband and five children. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared to be well and was breathing comfortably. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was 4430 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the lymphocyte count was 550 per microliter (reference range, 1000 to 4800). Blood levels of electrolytes and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Posteroanterior and lateral radiography of the chest revealed a 4-cm rounded mass in the right lower lobe (Figure 1A and 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign (Figure 1C). In addition, there were smaller ground-glass nodules at the periphery of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe, with associated right hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1C, 1D, and 1E). These findings are most consistent with viral pneumonia, although primary cancer of the lung cannot be ruled out. Imaging Studies of the Chest.Imaging studies were obtained on the patient\u2019s initial presentation to the emergency department. Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Panels A and B, respectively) show a rounded mass in the right lower lobe (arrows). Computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest (Panels C, D, and E), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, show a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign (Panel C, arrowhead). Additional, smaller ground-glass nodules are present at the periphery of the right middle lobe (Panel C, arrow) and left upper lobe (Panel D, arrow). There is associated right hilar lymphadenopathy (Panel E, arrow). Additional imaging studies were obtained 3 days later, during the patient\u2019s hospitalization. A portable chest radiograph (Panel F) shows that the discrete mass has evolved into faint patchy opacities in the right lower lobe (arrow). Intravenous fluids were administered, and the dizziness abated. Because there was an initial concern about the possibility of lung cancer, a telephone oncology consultation was requested.

The patient, who was a highly trained athlete, had been well until approximately 2.5 weeks before admission, when he was hit in the chest while he was at work; headache and nausea occurred for 3 days thereafter. Approximately 2 weeks before admission, he awoke at night with pain in the right midaxillary region that he described as a \u201cping-pong ball\u201d; the pain radiated to and from the right scapula and was associated with shortness of breath. He arose, and after pacing and calming himself, he was able to sleep again. The next day, he went to an urgent care clinic in another city, where a diagnosis of muscle spasm was made. Muscle relaxants and ibuprofen were administered, without improvement. During the following days, increasing dyspnea occurred with minimal exertion; the pain became localized to the right anterior chest and had a sharp, stabbing quality, and a nonproductive cough developed. Three days before admission, during a 1.5-hour flight to Massachusetts, the patient noted having leg cramps, which was a usual occurrence for him on flights. On the morning of admission, he felt well on awakening, but sudden stabbing chest pain in the sternal area later developed, with associated severe pressure in his chest and transient palpitations. While the patient was walking, he noted severe shortness of breath, with increasing tachypnea and difficulty talking. Chest pain increased with coughing, laughing, and sneezing. In the evening, the patient went to another hospital for evaluation, where he reported sharp chest pain on the right side that worsened with deep breaths; he rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He attributed some of his symptoms to his earlier chest injury. On examination, the patient reportedly appeared to be well. The blood pressure was 138/82 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rightward axis. Naproxen and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride were administered, with some improvement. Laboratory Data. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained at the other hospital showed a masslike opacity with ill-defined borders posterior to the right hilum, as well as prominent pulmonary arteries (Figure 1A). Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) angiography revealed a filling defect in the main and right pulmonary arteries and a mottled, wedge-shaped air-space opacity in the posterior right lower lobe, findings consistent with pulmonary embolism and infarction. However, the embolus was proximally attached to an irregular, enhancing central filling defect that extended into the right ventricle and probably the right atrium. There were signs of right ventricular strain (Figure 1B through 1E). Imaging Studies of the Chest.A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Panel A) shows a masslike opacity in the midlung zone behind the right hilum (arrow) and enlarged pulmonary arteries. Axial contrast-enhanced CT angiographic images were obtained at the lung-window setting (Panel B) and at the mediastinal-window setting (Panels C and D) at the level of the midchest. A mottled, wedge-shaped air-space opacity is present in the periphery of the right lower lobe (Panel B). A smooth, large, central filling defect (Panels B and C, arrows) is present that extends from the main pulmonary artery (MPA) to the right pulmonary artery (RPA). Central filling defects are also present in the interlobar and lobar branches of the right pulmonary artery (Panel D, arrows); the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) contains an irregular central filling defect with central contrast-filling channels rather than enhancement. An axial CT angiographic image (Panel E) shows a dilated right ventricle (RV), with a ratio of RV diameter to left ventricular (LV) diameter of 1.6 (normal, <1); a heterogeneously enhancing filling defect is evident in the RV cavity (arrow), as well as in the right atrium (not shown). Heparin was administered intravenously. Approximately 4 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, he was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for consideration of thrombolysis. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported pleuritic chest pain that had improved since earlier in the day. While he had been taking ibuprofen for the muscle spasms, he noted decreased appetite, with associated weight loss of approximately 1.5 kg. He had had traumatic injury with a cleat to the left calf approximately 3 months before admission; the calf had had minor bruising, without pain or swelling. Sixteen years earlier, the patient had had aStaphylococcus aureusskin infection involving his elbow that required d\u00e9bridement. Otherwise, he was healthy and physically active, regularly participating in semiprofessional sports. He had stopped taking ibuprofen more than 1 week before admission and was taking no other medications. He had no known allergies. He lived in another state with a roommate and worked in education. He drank alcohol occasionally and had never smoked cigarettes or used illicit drugs. He reported no sick contacts or recent hospitalizations. His maternal grandmother had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertension, strokes, myocardial infarction, and a deep venous thrombosis, and his paternal grandparents had had hypertension. His parents and siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/93 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The carotid arteries had no bruits, and the jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water, with a normal waveform. The lung sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally, with crackles involving the lower half of the right lung field but no dullness on percussion. The heart rate and rhythm were regular. The left ventricular impulse was discrete and nondisplaced, and there was a right ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed a normal first heart sound (S1), a second heart sound with a loud P2component, a faint low-pitched diastolic sound, and a systolic murmur (grade 2/6) at the base. There was no swelling, palpable mass or cord, erythema, tenderness, or edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB isoenzymes, troponin T, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen, and total homocysteine were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace albumin and was otherwise normal. An ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 beats per minute, with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, evidence of right-axis deviation, and no evidence of ischemia. Heparin therapy was continued, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the first hospital day, the blood creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized. On the second hospital day, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2; and seeVideos 1 through 8, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a highly mobile irregular mass, nearly 10 cm in length, with a frondlike appearance and heterogeneous echotexture. The mass moved back and forth between the right atrium and the right ventricle, and there was a suggestion of possible attachment near the tricuspid valve. The ventricular septal geometry indicated right ventricular pressure and volume overload, and the interatrial septum was stretched leftward. The right ventricle was mildly dilated and mildly hypokinetic in a manner that was suggestive of ventricular strain, but the left ventricle was normal. There was trace tricuspid regurgitation, but the other valves were normal. No mass was seen in the inferior vena cava. The echocardiographic appearance of the mass was not typical of a venous thrombus. Echocardiographic Images.These representative images were taken from the bedside transthoracic echocardiogram. The parasternal long-axis view (Panel A) shows an amorphous mass in the right ventricular outflow tract in late diastole (arrow); the left ventricle, left atrium, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aortic root are all normal. The right ventricular inflow view (Panel B) shows an irregular mass in the right ventricular inflow tract in diastole (arrow). The short-axis view at the level of the aortic valve (Panel C) shows the chambers on the right side of the heart, including the right atrium (arrowhead) and right ventricle (arrow); a heterogeneous frondlike mass is seen in the right ventricle in end diastole. An apical four-chamber view (Panel D) shows a mildly dilated right ventricle, deviation of the interatrial septum to the left (arrowhead) that is suggestive of elevated right atrial pressure, and a heterogeneous mass extending from the right ventricle (white arrow) to the right atrium (black arrow).

The patient had been well until 18 months earlier, when intermittent shaking of his right hand developed, which quickly progressed to involve the entire right arm. Evaluation at another hospital included electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed frequent left-sided discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head that revealed no clear atrophy but a lesion in the left motor strip, and a lumbar puncture with normal results on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. A diagnosis of focal motor seizures was made; levetiracetam and glucocorticoids were administered. Approximately 2 months after the onset of symptoms, twitching of the arm and hand became nearly constant and was accompanied by facial twitching; a clinical diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua was made. Intravenous immune globulin was administered, and the twitching in his face and arm almost completely resolved. Approximately 3 months later, however, the symptoms recurred. During the year before this evaluation, the right arm and the right side of the face began to twitch nearly continuously, with more intense focal clonic activity occurring 2 to 20 times per day; there was associated progressive weakness of the muscles of the right arm (more severe distally than proximally) and the right side of the face, increasing spasticity in the fingers and wrist, and subtle weakness of the right leg. There was no history of loss of consciousness, apnea, cyanosis, or seizure activity involving the left side. MRI studies of the head that were performed between 9 months and 3 months before this evaluation reportedly revealed a T2-weighted hyperintense lesion in the left motor strip involving the adjacent white matter and, in more recent studies, the parietal region, with no clear evidence of atrophy. A brain biopsy was recommended. The family sought a second opinion at this hospital. The patient was born at 36 weeks of gestation after the onset of preterm labor and had normal or advanced developmental milestones (including reading at 3 years of age). He had reactive airway disease and had undergone tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and urologic surgery. Medications included levetiracetam (800 mg twice daily), clonazepam (0.5 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening), oxcarbazepine (360 mg in the morning and 420 mg in the evening), valproic acid (375 mg twice daily), lipoic acid, vitamin B6, and coenzyme Q10. Immunizations were current. He had no known drug allergies. He consumed a ketogenic diet (a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet), which helped to control his seizures, and he participated in occupational and physical therapy. He lived with his parents and older sibling, was in second grade, and did well academically. His mother and sibling had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, a paternal aunt had bipolar disorder, and other paternal relatives had depression. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, and pleasant. His speech was clear and fluent, with mild dysarthria. He seemed to be intelligent, with good social skills. The pupils and extraocular movements were normal. There was weakness on the right side of the face, the palate was elevated symmetrically, and the tongue protruded along the midline. There was nearly continuous twitching of the right lower facial muscles. Muscle bulk, tone, and strength were normal in the left arm and leg. In the right arm, strength was 4/5 proximally, with little movement of the fingers or wrist and distal-muscle spasticity. Strength in the right leg was 4+/5, with slightly increased reflexes. The gait was mildly hemiparetic. A brain biopsy was recommended, and the family resumed care at the other hospital. During the next 6 months, twitching was constant in the right side of the face and nearly continuous in the right arm. The focal seizures in the right side of the face and right arm and leg (which frequently caused the patient to fall) occurred up to 20 times daily when he was tired or sick or had not adhered to his diet. Weakness of the right leg and arm increased, and his gait became more hemiparetic, despite continued medical therapy with levetiracetam, clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, and valproic acid and general adherence to the ketogenic diet. Six months after the initial evaluation at this hospital, the patient returned to this hospital for care. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed seizure activity in the left frontal lobe, with discharges predominantly in the posterior left frontal cortex, along the frontal operculum of the motor cortex (precentral gyrus) and the area associated with control of the hand, and abnormal somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields in the left hemisphere, findings suggestive of cortical dysfunction. During the MEG recording, there was continuous right facial twitching and some evidence that the right hemisphere was dominant for language. Three months later, the patient was admitted to this hospital. A 24-hour EEG showed that the focus of his continuous right facial twitching was in the left frontal area, with a broad electrical field involving the entire left hemisphere. EEG also recorded six generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures characterized by spike-and-wave discharges (1 to 2 Hz); the site of maximal amplitude was the midline central region, and the duration was approximately 15 to 40 seconds.

The patient had been well until approximately 24 months before this evaluation, when a dry, nonproductive cough developed. Results of laboratory testing, which was performed at another hospital, are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Twenty-one months before this evaluation, when the patient was seen by her physician at another clinic, she reported persistent cough, decreased appetite, and moderate but poorly localized abdominal pain. On examination, her weight was 108.9 kg (decreased from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg 5 months earlier). A proton-pump inhibitor was administered. During the following month, fatigue and myalgias occurred, followed by the appearance of painless \u201cred dots\u201d around her ankles. Evaluation of a skin-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed findings consistent with early pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Blood tests revealed peripheral eosinophilia. Twenty months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at the other hospital because of persistent cough; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening, a finding suggestive of chronic inflammation. Mildly enlarged lymph nodes were present in the paracardiac region, porta hepatis, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. During the following year, multiple evaluations by consultants in allergy, rheumatology, hematology\u2013oncology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology were performed. Nineteen months before this evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, and pathological examination of biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum revealed mild chronic and focally active gastritis. Immunohistochemical staining forHelicobacter pyloriwas negative, and the small-bowel villi were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed at the other hospital 18 months before this evaluation, revealed enlarged periportal lymph nodes. No focal lesions were seen in the liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, or adrenal glands. There was mild splenomegaly. The pancreas was not enlarged. Sixteen months before this evaluation, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed mild bronchial-wall thickening, lymphadenopathy in the axillae (with the largest node, in the right axilla, measuring 2.3 cm by 1.3 cm), an enlarged right epicardial lymph node (measuring 1.5 cm by 1.1 cm), and enlarged nodes in the portacaval, peripancreatic, and mesenteric regions (with the largest node, in the porta hepatis, measuring 4.2 cm by 2.9 cm). One month later, pathological examination of a right axillary lymph node revealed preserved architecture. Follicular and paracortical hyperplasia was present, along with a polytypic plasmacytosis. Immunostaining for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. The findings were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy; no evidence of hematologic cancer was identified. Therapeutic trials of oral metoclopramide, cetirizine, omeprazole, and budesonide; fluticasone nasal spray; and inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol resulted in no improvement. The patient continued to lose weight. Thirteen months before this evaluation,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET), performed at the other hospital, revealed FDG-avid lymph nodes in the axillae, the paracardial region, and the region of the right internal thoracic artery. The liver and spleen were enlarged and showed diffuse FDG uptake. Examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate revealed hypercellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis, increased eosinophils, megakaryocytes, and polyclonal plasma cells, findings that are consistent with a reactive process. Biopsy of the liver was performed to investigate the hepatosplenomegaly and the FDG uptake in the liver and spleen. Pathological examination of a core needle\u2013biopsy specimen of the liver revealed moderate-to-severe portal, periportal, and lobular inflammation that was predominantly composed of plasma cells (with polytypic expression of kappa and lambda light chains on immunohistochemical staining), with occasional eosinophils. Bile-duct proliferation, focal damage, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and scattered apoptotic hepatocytes were seen, and trichrome staining highlighted the presence of sinusoidal fibrosis. A stain for iron deposition was negative. The findings were thought to be consistent with an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and focal sclerosing cholangitis. Treatment with prednisone was begun but was discontinued by the patient for unspecified reasons. Azathioprine therapy was also begun at this time. A decrease in abdominal pain and fatigue was reported. Seven months before this evaluation, an FDG-PET examination with CT for attenuation correction was performed at the other hospital (Figure 1). Splenomegaly was present, and stably enlarged FDG-avid lymph nodes were seen in the axillae, the region of the internal thoracic artery, the right paracardiac region, and the retroperitoneal, iliac, and inguinal regions. There was no hilar lymphadenopathy. There was diffuse, mild, smooth bronchial-wall thickening. No pulmonary nodules or air-space opacities were present. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron-Emission Tomographic (PET) Scan.An FDG-PET examination with CT for attenuation correction was performed 7 months before the patient was evaluated at this hospital. An axial image obtained at the level of the aortic arch shows FDG-avid, enlarged lymph nodes in the region of the internal thoracic artery (arrowhead) and in the axillae (arrows). One month later, an inguinal lymph node was excised. Pathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia and a polytypic plasmacytosis of the medulla and sinusoidal regions. On immunohistochemical studies for IgG and IgG4, a small fraction of the plasma cells were immunoreactive for IgG4. Four months before this evaluation, the patient was evaluated for a nonproductive cough, severe fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, diffuse aches, swelling of the right knee, and night sweats. Further weight loss (to 88.5 kg from her baseline weight of 122.5 kg) was noted. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two months before this evaluation, severe and increasing bitemporal headache developed. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported daily headaches and pain in her jaw when she chewed food. She did not report dry eyes or dry mouth. She had hypertension, anemia, and chronic left-knee pain after an injury that had occurred 6 years previously; she had undergone a hysterectomy and trigger-finger release. A tuberculin skin test that had been performed 2.5 years earlier was negative. Medications included budesonide, azathioprine, omeprazole, metoclopramide, and losartan. Naproxen caused a rash; she had no other known allergies or history of atopy. She was from the Caribbean, lived in a city in New England, and worked in a health-related field. She drank alcohol sparingly and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and her father had had colon cancer when he was 70 years of age. A daughter had systemic lupus erythematosus; her other three children and five siblings were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 35.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 178/96 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 165 cm, the weight 87.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.1. The upper eyelids were prominent, and the lacrimal glands were swollen bilaterally (Figure 2A). The temporal arteries were swollen, indurated, and nodular bilaterally, with strong pulses and no tenderness (Figure 2B). The sublingual glands were hypertrophic bilaterally. A nontender lymph node, measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension, was present in the posterior cervical chain. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a palpable spleen tip. Warm synovial effusions were present in the right knee and left ankle. The left ankle was tender, and there were areas of palpable and nonpalpable purpura on both legs (Figure 2C). The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, and alkaline phosphatase and results of renal-function tests were normal. Tests for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and hepatitis B virus core antibodies were negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Diagnostic tests were performed.

The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food. Two months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastroenterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen. A scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88% at 2 hours, 81% at 3 hours, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The patient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient\u2019s symptoms. During the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutritional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, the patient described epigastric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost 13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including 5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent history of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esophagus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (\u226413 mm) in the stomach, particularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal (Figure 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules (\u22645 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter), as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter). CT Scan of the Abdomen.CT was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial image (Panel A) shows wall thickening at the antrum (arrowhead) and secondary distention of the stomach (arrow). An additional axial image (Panel B) shows circumferential wall thickening at the incisura and pyloric canal (arrowhead). A coronal image (Panel C) shows the antral thickening (arrowhead) and gastric distention (arrow). A nasogastric tube was inserted. Treatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. During the subsequent week, the patient received vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The patient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On transfer to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diverticulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki\u2019s ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash. The patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnologist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast cancer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild tenderness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sensory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Eleven months before this presentation, the patient traveled abroad; she lived for 2 months in Morocco and then for 2 months in Thailand, and during that time, she also traveled briefly to South Korea. She returned to New England and was well until 5 months before this presentation, when a painful erythematous papule developed on her chin. During the next week, she felt feverish. More papules developed near the initial skin lesion and coalesced into a plaque. A similar, larger skin lesion developed on the right forearm, and a small amount of white fluid drained from it. The patient presented to her primary care physician at another hospital for evaluation. At the primary care clinic, the patient reported myalgias and occasional sore throat. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C and the blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg. A 1-cm erythematous plaque with no ulceration was present on the left side of the chin, and a 1.5-cm lesion that was similar in appearance was present on the right forearm. Cephalexin was prescribed. Three days later, the skin lesions had not improved, and a new lesion had developed on the left forearm. The patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, the lesion on the right forearm was fluctuant. Incision yielded a small amount of bloody fluid; a culture of this fluid had no growth. A blood culture was also negative. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased echogenicity of the hepatic parenchyma (a finding suggestive of fatty infiltration) with no focal lesions of the liver. The gallbladder was normal, with no gallstones, and there was no dilatation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin were prescribed, and the patient was referred to a gastroenterologist because of the elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level. Laboratory Data. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported intermittent fatigue but no pruritus, abdominal pain, or arthralgias. Tests for antimitochondrial antibodies and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Results of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed that the gallbladder, intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary systems, and size and contour of the liver were normal. The elevated blood alkaline phosphatase level was thought to be related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; weight loss was advised. The patient returned to the primary care clinic for follow-up after completing the 7-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and topical mupirocin for treatment of the skin lesions. She reported that the lesions had decreased in size but continued to be painful. On examination, the lesion on the left forearm had resolved, and the lesion on the left side of the chin had decreased in size, flattened in appearance, and faded. The lesion on the right forearm remained erythematous and raised, with an overlying serous crust. The patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation. On examination in the dermatology clinic, there were well-demarcated, atrophic, depressed plaques on the left side of the chin. The appearance of the lesion on the right forearm was unchanged, and Gram\u2019s staining and culture of that lesion were negative. Cephalexin and topical clobetasol were prescribed. During the next week, the lesion on the chin recurred, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. On examination, a 2-cm circular, erythematous plaque was present at the site of the previous chin lesion, and the lesion on the right forearm had increased in size to 2 cm in diameter. A shave biopsy of the lesion on the chin was performed. Histologic examination reportedly revealed a perifollicular granulomatous and mixed inflammatory infiltrate that included neutrophils and eosinophils. No organisms were seen on periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining, Gram\u2019s staining, or staining for acid-fast bacilli. Doxycycline was prescribed. The patient traveled to Jordan and stayed for 4 weeks; during that time, the lesion on the left side of the chin receded, the lesion on the right forearm doubled in size, and the lesion on the left forearm recurred. Clusters of painful vulvovaginal ulcers developed; these waxed and waned. On her return to New England, the patient was referred by her primary care physician to an infectious disease specialist at this hospital. In the infectious disease clinic, the patient reported a 5-month history of waxing and waning skin lesions, a 2-month history of episodic vulvovaginal ulcers, and occasional nausea. She had a history of attention-deficit disorder. She took a combination birth control pill daily. Her father had diabetes mellitus, and her mother had hypertension and polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient was of European descent. She was a graduate student and traveled abroad frequently for internships. While she was in Morocco 11 months earlier, she rode on a camel; while she was in Thailand, she petted an elephant and swam in freshwater waterfall pools. She had not visited farms or milked animals and had no known sick contacts. She had been sexually active for several years with one partner, who used condoms. On examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/52 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. On the left side of the chin, there was a 2-cm area of faded erythema with a depressed, atrophic plaque. On each forearm, there was a 5-cm, well-demarcated, depressed, atrophic plaque with no ulceration or crust. Two 2-mm ulcers were present on the right labium minus and vaginal fourchette. The remainder of the examination was normal. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative, as were tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The biopsy specimen from the left side of the chin that had been obtained 4 months earlier was reviewed at this hospital. Histologic examination of the shave-biopsy specimen revealed a granulomatous dermal infiltrate (Figure 1A) that was composed of macrophages and scattered giant cells arranged in loose clusters. Admixed neutrophils and eosinophils were also seen (Figure 1B). No microorganisms were identified on Gram\u2019s staining, periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining, staining for acid-fast bacilli, or Giemsa staining. These histologic features are consistent with the diagnosis of granulomatous dermatitis, an entity that has numerous infectious and noninfectious causes. In this case, the shave-biopsy specimen consisted of only superficial dermis, and many of the features necessary for definitive pathological diagnosis were not present in the specimen. Given the presence of neutrophils, infection should be ruled out before noninfectious causes are considered. Skin-Biopsy Specimen from the Left Side of the Chin.Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows a granulomatous infiltrate in the superficial dermis (Panel A). At higher magnification, scattered neutrophils, eosinophils, and giant cells are seen (Panel B). Additional laboratory tests were performed; the results are shown inTable 2. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was ordered. Microbiologic Data. Four weeks after the patient was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital, fatigue and weakness developed in the left arm, along with associated numbness and tingling. The patient was evaluated in a clinic at this hospital, and the blood pressure could not be obtained in either arm despite multiple attempts at manual sphygmomanometry.

One month before the current evaluation, the patient, who lived in Panama, was seen at a primary care clinic in Colombia for a routine annual physical examination. He was in his usual state of good health, but because of a family history of cancer, he requested that imaging studies be obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, chest, and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a pulmonary nodule (measuring 12 mm by 13 mm) in the right middle lobe. Chest CT.Chest CT was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Images obtained in lung windows show a 12-mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe, abutting the major fissure (Panel A, arrow). The nodule has low attenuation and does not have calcification, macroscopic fat, or intense enhancement (Panel B, arrow). Normal-sized lymph nodes are present in the right hilum, subcarinal area, and right paratracheal region (Panels C and D, arrows). During the next month, follow-up testing was performed. The 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level in a 24-hour urine specimen and the chromogranin A level in blood were reportedly normal, as were the results of pulmonary function testing and colonoscopy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (Figure 2) revealed FDG uptake in the right-middle-lobe nodule (measuring 14 mm in diameter), with a maximum standardized uptake value of 3.8. There was also FDG uptake in multiple normal-sized right inferior paratracheal, subcarinal, and hilar lymph nodes. A right hilar lymph node (measuring 8 mm in diameter) had a maximum standardized uptake value of 6.7. PET Scan.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed. Intense FDG uptake is present in the right-middle-lobe nodule (Panel A, arrow) and in right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes (Panels B, C, and D; arrows). The patient requested evaluation in the United States and was referred to the multidisciplinary Pulmonary Nodule Clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient felt well. He had no fever, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, headache, vision changes, oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgias, or rash. He reported no recent illnesses. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Three years before this evaluation, chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, performed at his request because of a family history of cancer, had reportedly shown no abnormalities. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He worked in the finance industry and had previously been a health care worker. He was born in northern South America and had moved to southern Central America 5 years earlier. He lived in an urban area with his wife, son, and dog. The patient had visited nearly every country in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Four years earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Alaska to Panama; 6 months earlier, he had traveled by motorcycle from Colombia to Chile. The patient had also traveled to several countries in western and eastern Europe, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific Islands. He had a physically active lifestyle that included weight lifting and bicycling at least four times per week. He had smoked two cigarettes daily and one cigar every 3 months for 2 years. His family history of cancer included breast cancer in his mother, prostate and pancreatic cancers in his father, cancer of unknown primary origin in his maternal grandfather, and ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother. On evaluation, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/82 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subsequent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain worsened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient\u2019s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital. In the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7 kg; the physical examination was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, andEscherichia coliO157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptosporidium, andClostridioides difficiletoxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started. During the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient\u2019s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts. The patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her maternal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her maternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipidemia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash. The white-cell count was 10,690 per microliter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was 8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed. On EGD, two cratered esophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Figure 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Figure 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy specimens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation. Images Obtained during Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy.Images from upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy show two small, cratered ulcers located 30 cm from the incisors (Panel A) and diffuse mild gastritis (Panel B). Images from colonsocopy show no abnormalities in the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon (Panel C) but show a series of nonobstructing, large, dark-violet, protruding lesions farther into the sigmoid colon (Panel D); the mass becomes circumferential, and oozing blood is present (Panels E and F). When the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large volume of bright-red blood was noted to be draining from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleeding. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proximal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Figure 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced farther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonobstructing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treatment with pantoprazole was started. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest was performed (Figure 2A through 2D). There was irregular thickening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation. Initial Imaging Studies.Axial and coronal images from a CT scan (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained on hospital day 5, show multiple wedge-shaped areas of hypoenhancement in the kidneys, a finding consistent with ischemic lesions. Additional coronal images (Panels C and D) show an inflammatory pseudomass in the distal descending colon (arrows), with normal enhancement of the superior mesenteric vein and the portal vein (arrowheads). A coronal image from a CT angiogram of the chest (Panel E), obtained 3 days later, shows a large filling defect in a segmental branch of the right pulmonary artery (arrow), a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism. A right pleural effusion is also present. On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was 17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (reference range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the bloodd-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when pain developed in the right posterior region of her throat, which she attributed to recent dental work. Two weeks later, she went to another hospital because of persistent pain; a throat specimen was obtained for culture and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed. The throat culture was reportedly negative for pathogenic bacteria. On evaluation by her primary care physician at a second hospital four days later, she reported severe pain in the right side of the throat and odynophagia. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and there was purulent exudate over the right tonsil and cervical adenopathy on the right side. A repeat throat culture grew normal flora. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was continued. Eleven days later (approximately 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms), the patient was seen by a rheumatologist at a third hospital for routine follow-up of her seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, for which she was receiving various immunosuppressive medications, including methotrexate, anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (anti\u2013TNF-\u03b1) agents, and prednisone. She also had diabetes mellitus type 2, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic anemia, and recurrent aphthous ulcers and had had colon cancer in the remote past (which had reportedly been cured by partial bowel resection). She had no history of exposure to tuberculosis and had a negative purified protein derivative skin test. Medications at home included prednisone, methotrexate, infliximab, metformin, omeprazole, folic acid, and ferrous sulfate supplements, as well as acyclovir daily. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. There was prominent exudate at the right tonsillar bed and pain and decreased range of motion in her cervical spine and shoulders; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was advised to decrease her daily dose of prednisone, and planned doses of methotrexate and infliximab were withheld. The following day, on examination by her primary care physician, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C and there was persistent right tonsillar exudate. Azithromycin was prescribed. Laboratory Data. Three days later, the patient was seen in the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of persistent odynophagia. She reported pain on the right side of her throat, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), and headache. The pain did not radiate. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, malaise, or facial swelling. Otolaryngologic examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations that were consistent with broken vesicles on the right tonsil. The mucous membranes were moist and pink, the salivary secretions were clear, and the floor of the mouth and the tongue were soft and nontender on palpation. There was no trismus, erythema, or pus in the posterior pharynx. Endoscopic examination revealed minimally edematous turbinates in the nasal cavity, shallow ulcerations along the posterior tonsillar wall, and erythema of the right arytenoid complex with overlying shallow ulcerations to the midline. Oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen was administered. The patient returned home, with instructions to return for a follow-up visit in 1 week. Four days later, on repeat evaluation by her rheumatologist, she reported no relief in her throat pain and odynophagia, despite taking narcotic analgesic agents. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The right tonsillar bed and right posterior pharynx were ulcerated and covered with gray exudate. The otolaryngologist was contacted and recommended administration of a short course of prednisone at a dose of 50 mg per day. Three days later, she returned to the emergency department at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary for a scheduled follow-up visit. She reported persistent pain, which she rated at 10 out of 10, and associated decreasing oral intake. On endoscopic examination, there was decreased exudate on the right tonsil as compared with the amount of exudate seen on the previous examination, as well as resolving mucosal lesions on the posterior oropharyngeal wall and substantial improvement of the mucosal lesion on the right aryepiglottic fold. Prednisone was continued at a dose of 50 mg daily for 5 days and then decreased to a dose of 10 mg daily, and viscous lidocaine mouthwash was added. One week later (2 weeks after her initial presentation at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary), the patient returned for follow-up in the emergency department, as advised. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C and the other vital signs were normal. The right tonsil had persistent ulceration and was firm on palpation. Fiberoptic otolaryngoscopy revealed a tonsillar mass and ulcer extending along the right pharyngeal wall to the aryepiglottic fold, as well as persistent white exudate over the right aryepiglottic fold. An appointment in the head and neck clinic was scheduled for 3 days later. In the clinic, the patient reported burning pain (which she rated at 10 out of 10), pain on swallowing, a globus sensation in the right side of her throat, weight loss of 4.5 to 5 kg since the onset of symptoms, and weakness. An ulcer extended along the right posterior pharyngeal wall to the larynx. The vocal cords were mobile and symmetric bilaterally. The following day, the patient was admitted to this hospital. Medications on admission included prednisone, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, omeprazole, glyburide, metformin, acyclovir, simvastatin, lisinopril, aspirin, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, calcium, and vitamin D. The patient was widowed and lived alone, with her adult children living nearby. She was born in South America and had last visited 15 years earlier. She had traveled to a rural area in New England 3 months before this admission and had worked in a garden in that area for several days. She had no exposures to sick people, pets, or other animals. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of head or neck cancer. The platelet count and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous fluids were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormally thickened and enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus, extending to the right palatine tonsil (Figure 1A). The thickened soft tissue continued inferiorly, involving the right lateral pharyngeal wall (Figure 1B), and extended to the right aspect of the epiglottis (Figure 1C) and the right aryepiglottic fold (Figure 1D). Asymmetrically prominent lymph nodes were present in the right side of the neck (Figure 1E). A few lymph nodes were slightly irregular, with hazy margins. CT Scan of the Neck.An axial, contrast-enhanced image obtained at the level of the palatine tonsils shows thickened, enhancing soft tissue around the right glossotonsillar sulcus (Panel A, arrows), extending to the right palatine tonsil (arrowhead), which is enlarged. A coronal image shows diffuse thickening of the right pharyngeal wall (Panel B, arrows). An additional axial image shows thickening of the right aspect of the epiglottis (Panel C, arrow) and of the anterosuperior edge of the aryepiglottic fold (arrowhead). At a more caudal level, there is diffuse thickening of the right aryepiglottic fold (Panel D, arrow). A coronal image shows prominent lymph nodes in the right side of the neck (Panel E, arrows); some of the nodes have slightly irregular and hazy margins (arrowheads). Glucose levels ranged from normal values to 263 mg per deciliter (14.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 67 to 106 mg per deciliter [3.7 to 5.9 mmol per liter]), and insulin was administered on a sliding scale, as needed.

Approximately 5 years before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient was becoming more forgetful and napped frequently during the day. She also noticed that he lacked initiative in his professional work; for example, he was not charging or collecting payments for services. The patient\u2019s coworkers observed that he was having difficulty focusing and frequently required redirection when interacting with clients. The patient had no concerns other than intermittent mild headaches. During the next few years, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that he became distant with family, was less talkative, and lacked interest in activities that he had previously enjoyed. He made numerous costly errors at work and also had odd behaviors. For example, he entered the kitchen of a local restaurant without permission; on another occasion, he inadvertently borrowed a vehicle from a colleague without first notifying that person. In another instance, while the patient\u2019s vehicle was stopped for a routine traffic infraction, he became irritable and briefly evaded police, incurring several legal violations. One year before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the neurology and psychiatry clinics of another hospital at his wife\u2019s request. He had no concerns about his neurocognitive state. He noted that he was sleeping as little as 2 to 3 hours per night but had a good energy level. He reported intermittent mild headaches. He had no sinus pain, numbness, tingling, or constitutional symptoms. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with some inattention and confabulation. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests of kidney, liver, and thyroid function. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and for Lyme disease were negative. The patient received diagnoses of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, adjustment disorder, and avoidant personality traits. Psychotherapy was initiated, and melatonin and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine were prescribed. The patient had ongoing personality changes and difficulties with organization and daily functioning, and he was evaluated in the memory disorders clinic of this hospital at his wife\u2019s request. She reported that dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine had not improved his overall organizational abilities. Although he was physically capable of conducting activities of daily living, he required prompting to perform tasks to maintain basic hygiene, such as bathing. He no longer participated in the management of family finances; he was unable to maintain employment and was receiving disability payments. He had new odd behaviors, such as urinating in public on a few occasions and frequently and unexpectedly visiting family members\u2019 workplaces and neighbors\u2019 homes at late hours. He also had obsessive behaviors, such as calling his children multiple times to confirm details before a scheduled gathering. The patient was unaware of his inappropriate and unusual behaviors. He did not report having anxiety, depression, or perceptual disturbances. Approximately 10 years before the current evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia. Because he was asymptomatic, treatment was deferred. Two years before the current evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for disease surveillance. There were multiple enlarged hilar and retrocrural lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with no evidence of organomegaly or focal osseous lesions. The patient attended routine oncology appointments for disease monitoring. Two months before the current evaluation, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel were normal. The blood IgM level was 2850 mg per deciliter (reference range, 40 to 230), and the \u03b22-microglobulin level 2.8 mg liter (reference range, 0 to 2.7); these values had been stable since the diagnosis of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia was established. Other medical history included mitral regurgitation, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis. There was no history of head trauma, stroke, or seizure. Medications included a multivitamin and fish oil; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, and his daughters and grandchildren lived nearby. He had graduated from high school and trade school before serving in the navy for 2 years; he did not serve in a combat role or have known exposure to toxins. Both of his parents had heart disease, a sister had depression, and a maternal uncle had throat cancer. There was no family history of dementia, neurologic disorders, or psychiatric disorders. On examination, the patient was well groomed, pleasant, and cooperative. Physical appearance was normal. His Mini\u2013Mental State Examination score was 23 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function), and his Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 15 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function). Orientation was intact except for an error in recalling the date. On testing of attention, the patient had difficulty with serial sevens calculations and with the digit-span test, in which a sequence of numbers is read by the examiner and repeated by the patient; he repeated only four digits of the forward span correctly. On testing of memory, he repeated five out of five words after two trials and did not spontaneously recall any of the words after 5 minutes; he recalled three of the words when selecting from a written list of word choices. Spontaneous speech production was diminished. On testing of confrontation naming, he identified a camel when shown a picture of a giraffe. On testing of semantic and phonemic fluency, he spontaneously generated six animal names over a 1-minute period, as well as one word that begins with the letter \u201cF\u201d over a 1-minute period. The clock-drawing test showed good organization. The letter\u2013number sequencing test (also known as the alternating trail-making test) revealed impaired set shifting, and Luria\u2019s three-step test revealed impaired motor sequencing. On testing of verbal abstraction, when the patient was asked to describe how a train and a bicycle are similar, he stated, \u201cA train is bigger than a bicycle and would crush the bicycle.\u201d Judgment and insight were markedly impaired. An evaluation of cranial nerve function, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Bilateral grasp reflexes and palmomental reflexes were present. Testing for syphilis was negative. The blood folate level was 8.2 ng per milliliter (19 nmol per liter; reference range, >4.7 ng per milliliter [11 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12level 258 pg per milliliter (190 pmol per liter; reference range, >231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]). On neuropsychological assessment, social engagement was limited, with a few moments of giggling that was incongruent with the context. Spontaneous speech was fluent but impoverished. There was frequent use of the word \u201cthing\u201d to replace lower-frequency words and periodic use of phonemic paraphasias such as \u201ca fenco type of thing.\u201d Thoughts were coherent but impoverished, tangential, and perseverative. Attention and executive functioning were markedly impaired during assessments of verbal fluency, divided attention, abstract reasoning, and inhibitory control.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2020To convert the values for bilirubin to micromoles per liter, multiply by 17.1. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1). CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.An axial image at the level of the pelvis shows indeterminate bilateral adnexal soft-tissue lesions (arrows), measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side, where foci of calcification are present, and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side. Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated. During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness. On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided. On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance. A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia. On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care. On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure. One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge.

Approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation, mild pruritus of the palms and soles developed. At 32 weeks 5 days of gestation (16 days before this evaluation), the patient was afebrile, had no visible rash, and reported fetal activity; both fetal hearts were heard on auscultation. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A spot urinalysis revealed trace protein. A diagnosis of cholestasis of pregnancy was made, and ursodiol was administered. Four days later, at 33 weeks 2 days of gestation, the patient reported persistent itching, nausea, and occasional vomiting, along with a new pruritic rash on her abdomen that was thought to be consistent with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy. The results of a biophysical profile that assessed fetal well-being were reassuring. The patient returned home. Laboratory Data. On the afternoon of the current evaluation, the patient called the obstetrics staff and reported that she had felt \u201ccrummy\u201d during the previous week and had noticed decreased fetal activity that day, with a maximum of four movements in 1 hour, despite hydration. She was advised to come to the labor and delivery triage unit for evaluation. On arrival, she reported nausea, decreased appetite, frequent urination (which was unchanged from baseline), subjective fevers, and chills; she did not report bleeding, dysuria, or loss of fluid. She also reported contractions that had occurred during the previous 2 days and had resolved spontaneously. The patient\u2019s medical history included the presence of the sickle cell trait, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and exercise-induced asthma, and she had had dysmenorrhea, a stress fracture of her left tibia,Clostridium difficileinfection after clindamycin use, and pancreatitis. Prenatal testing was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Her current medications were ursodiol, iron polysaccharide, a prenatal vitamin, doxylamine for sleep, ranitidine, and an albuterol inhaler. She was black and married and worked in the medical field. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She did not eat lunch meat or soft cheeses during pregnancy but noted that she consumed well-boiled hot dogs and frequently ate commercial-brand hummus. Her father had had deep venous thromboses; her husband did not carry the sickle-cell trait. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/71 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The two fetal heart rates were 140 and 150 beats per minute, with accelerations and moderate variability; no decelerations were noted. On tocodynamometry, uterine contractions were noted to occur every 4 minutes initially, and the frequency decreased to every 8 minutes after intravenous hydration. The platelet count and urinalysis were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A urine culture was obtained. Acetaminophen was administered, and the infusion of intravenous fluids and fetal monitoring were continued. The fetal heart patterns remained reassuring, and the patient reported increased fetal movement. She was discharged home later that evening and advised to monitor her temperature, to return in 2 days for an evaluation, and to call if symptoms worsened. Induction of labor was scheduled for 5 days after this evaluation. The next morning, the temperature was again 38.1\u00b0C, and the patient self-administered acetaminophen. She spoke with her obstetrician and was referred to the labor and delivery triage unit. On presentation, she reported feeling tired and ill and having nausea, loose stools, rigors, arthralgias, and myalgias. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C initially and rose to 38.4\u00b0C within 30 minutes after her arrival; the blood pressure was 133/71 mm Hg, and the pulse 75 beats per minute. The abdomen was nontender but was noted to be warm to the touch. The cervix was closed and soft, although the uterus was contracting intermittently. The two fetal heart rates were 170 and 180 beats per minute. There was 1+ leg edema. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Specimens of urine and blood were cultured. Rectal and vaginal swabs were obtained to screen for group B streptococcal colonization. Results of bedside ultrasonography confirmed that both fetuses were in the vertex position. Because the patient was thought to have chorioamnionitis, the decision was made to begin the induction of labor. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit, and ampicillin, gentamicin, and oxytocin were administered. During the course of the induction, cough and pleuritic chest pain developed. A chest radiograph was obtained. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1) showed low lung volumes and patchy right basilar opacities that were thought to most likely represent atelectasis. Pneumonia could not be ruled out. Chest Radiograph.An anteroposterior chest radiograph that was obtained at the time of admission shows low lung volumes and patchy right basilar opacities that were thought to most likely represent atelectasis, although pneumonia could not be ruled out. Labor progressed slowly, despite artificial rupture of membranes. Approximately 15 hours after admission, a cesarean section was performed because of a nonreassuring heart-rate pattern in one of the fetuses, and two healthy infants were delivered.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admission, when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission, fever developed. On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was accompanied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmonary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein thrombosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever. Past treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were attributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated. Other medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for headache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home. There was also a history of coronavirus disease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness fluctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not provide a coherent history of his illness. The temperature was 39.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiffness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The patient was not able to participate fully in a neurologic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney-function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than 5.0 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respiratory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed mucosal thickening with layering fluid levels in both maxillary sinuses, but the study was otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature. Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and headache abated, but the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 72% lymphocytes, 13% neutrophils, 11% monocytes, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms.

The patient had been well until 1 year before this evaluation, when explosive diarrhea developed. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy revealed evidence of microscopic colitis. Prednisone was administered, and the diarrhea resolved; after the prednisone therapy was tapered and then stopped, diarrhea recurred. Budesonide was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the patient was seen at a local gastroenterology clinic. She had abdominal bloating and reported that reducing the dose of budesonide had been associated with recurrent diarrhea. She was following a lactose-free, gluten-free diet. On examination, the abdomen was distended and soft and had no masses. Budesonide was continued, and discontinuation of daily aspirin was recommended. Six weeks later and 6.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of increased abdominal bloating, which was reported to be worse late in the day. She also reported that sexual intercourse had been difficult that week because her vagina seemed shorter. On examination, the abdomen was distended, with mild diffuse tenderness and slightly hyperactive bowel sounds. Results of a bimanual pelvic examination were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anion gap, blood level of total bilirubin, and results of renal-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Four days later, imaging studies of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed moderate ascites (Figure 1A) and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking (Figure 1B), findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The ovaries were normal in size, and the uterus appeared enlarged (Figure 1C). Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material approximately 6 weeks before the current evaluation, show moderate ascites (Panel A, arrow) and extensive peritoneal nodularity with omental caking (Panel B, arrow), findings consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The uterus appears enlarged (Panel C, arrow). Seven days later and 5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology clinic at another hospital. Results of coagulation tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, and cytologic examination of an aspirate of peritoneal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma, a finding that is most consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of a gynecologic origin. One week later and 4 weeks before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital. She had a history of colitis, hypertension, type 1 second-degree atrioventricular block, the sick sinus syndrome, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, atopy, chronic upper-airway cough syndrome, osteopenia, vitamin B12deficiency, and glaucoma and had undergone laparoscopy with salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy. Medications included oral budesonide, diltiazem, cetirizine, and probiotics and intramuscular cyanocobalamin. She had allergies to tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and latex; atorvastatin had caused elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The patient lived with her husband in a rural area of New England; she typically traveled to coastal New England during the summer but had not done so during the preceding year. She did not have pets. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 99 beats per minute, the blood pressure 169/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 49.3 kg. The abdomen was distended, and a fluid wave was present. The vaginal mucosa was atrophic, the uterus was anteverted and mobile, and there were no cul-de-sac nodularities or adnexal masses. The anion gap and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, globulin, and total bilirubin; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Three days later and 3.5 weeks before this evaluation, the patient underwent surgical exploration and cytoreduction for a presumptive diagnosis of m\u00fcllerian adenocarcinoma. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered preoperatively; phenylephrine, insulin, calcium chloride, fentanyl, hydromorphone, lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, albumin, and 3 units of packed red cells were administered during the procedure. Operative findings included approximately 2 liters of straw-colored ascitic fluid, tumor nodules in the splenic hilum and parenchyma and studding the right hemidiaphragm, replacement of the gastrocolic omentum by tumor, and obliteration of the cul-de-sac by a large pelvic mass invading and partially obstructing the rectosigmoid colon. Gastrocolic omentectomy, splenectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, resections of the pelvic mass and rectosigmoid colon with primary reanastomosis, and plasma energy vaporization of tumor nodules on the right hemidiaphragm were performed. Resection specimens were submitted for histopathological examination. The primary resection specimen consisted of a 15.2-cm aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures that were firmly adherent one to another and contained a 15.0-cm irregular, firm, tan-white mass (Figure 2A). The cervix, the spleen, and portions of the omentum were submitted separately for examination. Microscopic examination revealed high-grade carcinoma in the ovaries, invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel (Figure 2B), and adjacent to the fallopian tubes (Figure 2C). The tumor was also seen adjacent to the uterine serosa and in the omentum, spleen, and mesentery of the transverse colon. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of pleomorphic cells with high mitotic activity (Figure 2D) and had slitlike spaces and psammomatous calcifications (Figure 2E). On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for PAX8 (Figure 2F) and negative for p53. The findings were consistent with high-grade carcinoma of m\u00fcllerian origin. M\u00fcllerian carcinoma may most recognizably originate in a pelvic organ, such as the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, but it may also be found multifocally in the peritoneum without clear evidence of a particular site of origin, as was the case with this patient. Specimen of the Resected Pelvic Mass.A gross photograph of the specimen of the resected pelvic mass shows an aggregate of large bowel, uterus, and adnexal structures containing a 15-cm tan-white, firm, ill-defined mass (Panel A). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections shows tumor in the right ovary (Panel B, right side), invading the muscularis propria of the large bowel (Panel B, left side), and present as a serosal nodule adjacent to the left fallopian tube (Panel C). The tumor consists of nests and cords of cohesive, pleomorphic cells with brisk mitotic activity (Panel D); these features are consistent with high-grade carcinoma. The tumor has slitlike spaces and psammomatous calcifications (Panel E). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells is diffusely positive for PAX8 (Panel F). The patient had persistent hypotension after surgery and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit, where phenylephrine and mechanical ventilatory support were continued. A right pneumothorax was managed with chest-tube placement. On the first day after surgery, the trachea was extubated. The next day, phenylephrine was discontinued, 2 units of packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was transferred to the inpatient unit, where the chest tube was removed 1 day later. Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, Y, and W), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, andHaemophilus influenzaetype b conjugate vaccine were administered. On the seventh day after surgery, the patient was discharged home. Three days after discharge and 16 days before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic at this hospital for follow-up. She was thought to be recovering well, and the staples were removed from her surgical incision. A plan was made to schedule chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin at the other hospital. Eighteen days after discharge and 1 day before this evaluation, the patient returned to the gynecologic oncology surgery clinic because of fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain, bloating, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. She had not yet begun chemotherapy. She reported that abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements had been present since surgery and that the night before this presentation, she had tried medical marijuana, which she had obtained from a friend, as a treatment for pain before going to sleep. When she awoke 14 hours later, she felt drowsy and the abdominal pain persisted. Abdominal imaging was performed. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed postsurgical changes that had occurred since she had undergone the peritoneal cytoreduction, total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, splenectomy, and rectosigmoid colon resection. Ascites had decreased, and only trace residual perihepatic fluid was present (Figure 3A). No abscesses were identified. There was no evidence of obstruction or inflammatory changes of the bowel (Figure 3B), and the rectosigmoid anastomosis was unremarkable in appearance (Figure 3C).", "true_dx": "Transfusion-related babesiosis.", "pred_dx": "High-Grade Serous Carcinoma of the Ovary", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 71-year-old woman who came in with some pretty concerning symptoms like fever, fatigue, and myalgias.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's already setting off some alarms.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Then, we find out she has a history of m\u00fcllerian carcinoma, which makes me immediately consider how this could all connect.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's been dealing with diarrhea, and it seems like it started around the same time as her cancer diagnosis.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, that's interesting.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They treated her with prednisone, which helped, but when they stopped it, the diarrhea came back.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, it looks like there might be a link between her medication and her digestive issues.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, she's also experiencing abdominal bloating and difficulty with sexual intercourse due to a feeling of vaginal shortening.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This could be related to the surgery she had, maybe?

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before presentation, when his parents noted that he began to have intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. During these episodes, some of which woke the patient from sleep, he cried and pulled his legs up toward his chest while lying on his back. His parents reported that they palpated his abdomen during some of the episodes and it felt rigid; they suspected that he might be having discomfort related to excessive intestinal gas. He continued to eat and drink normally without vomiting. The next day, the patient had two bowel movements, and the stools had reddish discoloration. With the first bowel movement, the redness seemed to be present in a small amount and only on the outside of the stool; with the second bowel movement, the amount of redness increased. The patient\u2019s mother attributed the stool discoloration to beet consumption, since bowel movements with reddish stools had also occurred in the past after the patient had eaten beets. Intermittent episodes of apparent abdominal pain continued, and between the episodes, the patient behaved normally. On the morning of presentation, he had a third bowel movement with reddish stools. His parents took him to day care, where he continued to have occasional periods of crying and pain, followed by a bowel movement that appeared to consist almost entirely of blood, including a large clot. After this bowel movement, he was reportedly pale and diaphoretic. The day care provider called the patient\u2019s mother, who picked him up and took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 178 beats per minute, the blood pressure 95/52 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 9.1 kg. On palpation of the abdomen, there was diffuse tenderness, which was greater on the right side than on the left, and no masses. There were no external anal fissures, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Two hours after arrival at the other hospital, the patient passed a dark-red stool that was described as resembling currant jelly. Intravenous normal saline (5 ml per kilogram) was administered, and he was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The patient had a history of infantile colic and gastroesophageal reflux, which had previously been treated with ranitidine. He received a low-lactose cow milk\u2013based formula. Pureed fruits and vegetables had recently been introduced into his diet, after which constipation developed, his stools became more firm, and daily bowel movements were associated with straining. He received cholecalciferol, and he had begun using an unspecified over-the-counter teething gel and unspecified homeopathic teething tablets 1 week earlier. Immunizations were current through 4 months of age; vaccines (including the second dose of live, oral human\u2013bovine reassortant pentavalent rotavirus vaccine) had been administered 6 weeks earlier. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his parents, attended day care, and had no known sick contacts. His parents were from Brazil; he was born in the United States and had not traveled outside the country. There was no family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared well. Bowel sounds were present; the abdominal examination was otherwise limited because the patient was crying. The diaper contained melena and a small amount of stool. The remainder of the examination was normal. Thirty-five minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, an ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed. There was no evidence of intussusception, appendicitis, a focal lesion, or abnormally dilated bowel loops. Bowel peristalsis was present. On examination after ultrasonography, the pulse was 168 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/36 mm Hg. The patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses, and bowel sounds were present. Results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein were normal, as were the anion gap, platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests.

Eight days before admission, fever to a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C developed, with worsening pruritus, erythema, and swelling of both legs. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. On examination, there was diffuse erythroderma and left axillary lymphadenopathy. Oxacillin, mupirocin ointment, and triamcinolone cream were administered. Blood cultures were sterile. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal; testing for antibodies to SSA (Ro), SSB (La), filaria, trichinella, and cysticercus was negative. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. A hematologist noted very few of what were possibly S\u00e9zary cells on a peripheral-blood smear. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells for theBCR, ABL, CHIC2, PDGFRA,andFIP1L1gene regions was normal, and no clonal rearrangement of T-cell\u2013receptor genes was detected. A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1) after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material revealed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (\u22643 cm in the short axis), bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (\u22644 cm), bilateral small pleural effusions, and stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the pelvis, features consistent with the history of bilateral leg edema. No mediastinal, hilar, or intraabdominal lymphadenopathy was identified. CT Images of the Chest and Pelvis from the Other Hospital.Selected images from CT scans of the chest (Panel A) and pelvis (Panel B) show axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy (arrows), as well as subcutaneous edema of the pelvis (arrowhead). Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspirate of an axillary lymph node revealed small lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of an abnormal lymphocyte population. On the eighth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included doxepin, hydroxyzine, enoxaparin, acetaminophen, and lorazepam, with topical triamcinolone and mupirocin. The patient reported pain with walking, diffuse itching, dizziness, weakness, occasional diaphoresis and shaking chills, weight gain of approximately 9 kg in the previous 2 weeks, and chronic headaches. She had no history of blood transfusions. She was allergic to aspirin (angioedema). She was born in Puerto Rico and had moved to the Boston area 5 months earlier to live with relatives and seek medical attention. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of heart disease, her mother had Alzheimer's disease and pancreatic disease, and two nieces had systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/58 mm Hg, and the pulse 126 beats per minute; the respirations and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse confluent erythroderma with superficial scaling and erosions, foci of lichenification, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and follicular prominence on the back (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C). There was madarosis, bilateral small ectropion of the eyelids, and painful pitting edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Testing for syphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. Pathological examination of a skin-biopsy specimen from the left leg showed changes consistent with an eczematous process. Examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node showed dermatopathic lymphadenitis; flow cytometry showed no abnormal lymphocyte populations. Flow cytometry on a specimen of peripheral blood showed 35% T cells with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 10, with 7% CD3+CD7\u2212 cells, which also expressed CD4, and normal expression of other antigens (see Fig. 1A in theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Clobetasol ointment and urea (40%) cream were applied topically, with some improvement. Examination of skin-biopsy specimens of the left and right legs, obtained on the sixth day, showed eczematous and interface dermatitis, dyskeratotic cells, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The patient was discharged later that day. Clinical Photographs of the Patient.There is diffuse erythroderma, alopecia, and edema before treatment (Panels A, B, and C). The erythroderma cleared after three cycles of extracorporeal photopheresis, but after the fourth cycle, new scaly plaques developed (Panels D and E). During the next year, the patient had persistent erythroderma, progressive alopecia, and recurrent infections requiring hospitalization and treatment with antibiotics, topical glucocorticoids, and intermittent high-dose prednisone. Further evaluation included extensive patch testing, which revealed no positive allergens, and multiple additional skin biopsies, which were nondiagnostic. Test results from this period are shown inTable 1; other tests for autoantibodies were negative, and levels of tryptase, IgG, and IgA were normal, as were the results of other screening tests. Eleven months after the patient's initial admission to this hospital, pain and swelling developed around an intravenous catheter site while she was receiving nafcillin intravenously and taking oral prednisone (60 mg) daily, and she was readmitted to this hospital. The catheter was removed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. Cultures of the blood were negative.

Approximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, rituximab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontinued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued. Four months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplantation of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level decreased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immediately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the creatinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter). Four days before the current admission, the patient began to have central abdominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for palpitations and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney transplantation), coronary artery disease (with placement of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a retired business owner and lived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack-years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, diminished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the incision was well healed. Blood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachycardia with right bundle-branch block. Vancomycin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intravenously.

Radiography of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung. Ultrasonography that targeted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive findings in the left lung than in the right lung, as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft. Imaging Studies.A radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows confluent basilar consolidation in the left lung (arrowhead) and scattered patchy opacities in the right lung (arrow). Doppler ultrasound images targeting the renal allograft (Panels B through E) show normal renal parenchyma with a trace amount of perinephric fluid (Panel C, arrow) and patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but show elevated renal arterial resistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. CT images of the chest (Panels F and G), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show confluent consolidation with air bronchograms in the lower lobes of both lungs (arrowheads), as well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes and the right middle lobe (arrows). A CT image of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel H), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant (arrow), along the renal allograft. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital. Phenylephrine was administered intravenously. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive forStreptococcus pneumoniaein four of four bottles. A blood test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated.

Placental membranes had ruptured less than 24 hours before birth, and antibiotic drugs were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9. The first hepatitis B immunization was administered to the patient before he was discharged. Two days before presentation, at a routine 1-month examination by his pediatrician, he was well, and the second hepatitis B immunization was administered. The day before admission, the patient's mother noted increased fussiness, with pale and warm skin; one episode of vomiting occurred. On the morning of admission, tachycardia was noted and vomiting increased. On examination at the pediatrician's office, the patient was pale, with mottled skin; the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C. He was referred immediately to the emergency department of a second hospital. On examination, the weight was 3.61 kg, the rectal temperature 38.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/63 mm Hg, the pulse 172 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 64 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. He was pale, listless, and fussy, with mild suprasternal and intercostal retractions, without grunting or nasal flaring. The remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed dark red, cloudy urine, with a pH of 7.0, a specific gravity of 1.015, a large amount of blood, 100 mg per deciliter of protein, and trace leukocyte esterase by dipstick, as well as 0 to 5 red cells and white cells per high-power field and a small amount of bacteria, a moderate number of epithelial cells, and 15 to 20 granular casts per low-power field. Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and a bolus of normal saline were administered intravenously, and a transfusion of leukocyte-depleted, packed red cells (type O, Rh-negative) was begun. Less than 4 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital; en route, clindamycin, crystalloid solution, and the remainder of the red-cell transfusion were administered intravenously, and oxygen was given through a nasal cannula. Laboratory Data. The patient had previously been well, consuming both breast milk and formula. He lived with his parents, his twin, and an older sibling in a suburban, forested neighborhood, where the mother frequently walked. Approximately 2.5 months before the admission, the parents had vacationed on an island off the coast of Massachusetts; years earlier, they had visited the Caribbean, which has been their only international travel. The parents reported that they recently had upper respiratory tract symptoms; the family had a pet dog. On examination, the patient was crying vigorously and had pale and mottled skin. The temperature was 39.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 101/69 mm Hg, and the pulse 176 beats per minute; the respiratory rate was 68 breaths per minute, with supraclavicular, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, and the oxygen saturation was 97% while the patient was breathing 1 liter of oxygen through a nasal cannula. The anterior fontanelle was soft and flat, and there was no scleral icterus. A holosystolic-flow murmur, grade 2/6, was heard. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention, and the spleen was palpated 2 to 3 cm below the costal margin. The arms and legs were mottled and slightly cool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, phosphorus, ionized calcium, and creatine kinase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a finding consistent with pulmonary edema, and a hazy opacity in the left upper abdomen, a finding consistent with splenomegaly (Figure 1). Results of ultrasonography of the head were normal. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal for the patient's age, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right shunting. Radiograph of the Chest and Abdomen.An anteroposterior chest and abdominal radiograph obtained on admission shows perihilar vascular congestion, a finding consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is normal. The bowel-gas pattern in the abdomen is normal, and a homogeneous haziness overlying the left upper abdomen is consistent with splenomegaly.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 days before this transfer, when a dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue developed. Two days later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the emergency department at a local hospital. The temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 94/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, he appeared well, and the lung sounds were clear. The white-cell count was 5600 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,500); 56% of the cells were neutrophils and 33% were lymphocytes. A nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to the Massachusetts State Laboratory for nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed owing to a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small (1 to 1.5 cm in diameter), rounded central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Figure 1A). Imaging Studies of the Chest.An axial CT image (Panel A), obtained without intravenous contrast enhancement during the initial emergency department presentation, shows scattered, confluent central and peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lungs. A radiograph (Panel B) obtained on admission to the intensive care unit shows extensive confluent parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The endotracheal tube is 7 cm above the carina, prompting subsequent adjustment; the central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein is in an appropriate position, terminating in the superior vena cava, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Sternal wires and right shoulder arthroplasty from the patient\u2019s previous surgeries are visible. Oseltamivir was prescribed for the empirical treatment of influenza, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department and instructed to self-quarantine at home. During the next 4 days, his symptoms persisted; when dyspnea developed, he contacted his primary care physician and was referred back to the emergency department at the local hospital. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/91 mm Hg, the heart rate 108 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed; auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Intravenous propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to an academic health center in Boston for further evaluation and management of symptoms. On the patient\u2019s arrival at the academic health center, his family was available to provide information regarding medical history, surgical history, and a recent review of systems by telephone. The review of systems was negative for conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinusitis, anosmia, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, and edema. The patient\u2019s status with respect to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was unknown. His medical history was notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. He had undergone surgical aortic-valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis 1 year earlier; there had been no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on preoperative angiography. Radiofrequency ablation for recurrent atrial flutter had been performed 2 years earlier, and he had undergone right shoulder arthroplasty. Medications included metformin, insulin lispro, atenolol, losartan, and apixaban. Multiple statin medications had previously caused myalgia with elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was a health care worker but had no known sick contacts. No family members were ill. He had not traveled recently or had other environmental exposures. He did not use tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. His family history was notable for coronary artery disease in multiple relatives; there was no history of pulmonary disease. The patient was admitted to a dedicated Covid-19 ICU at the academic health center. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg while he was receiving intravenous norepinephrine, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 410 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The patient was sedated. There was no jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the chest revealed a tachycardic rhythm with no murmur and coarse breath sounds with rhonchi in both lungs. His arms and legs were cool and clammy. The remainder of the examination was normal. Catheters were placed in the right internal jugular vein and the left radial artery. The central venous pressure was 4 mm Hg. The partial-thromboplastin time and blood levels of phosphorus and magnesium were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for nucleic acid testing for the detection of community-acquired respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Figure 1B) showed extensive confluent central and peripheral parenchymal opacities in both lungs. The central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein was in an appropriate position. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, PR-segment deviations (a depression in lead II and an elevation in lead aVR), and a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 425 msec. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, as well as dysfunction of the right ventricular free wall and the apex (seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). These findings were new relative to an echocardiogram that had been obtained 2 months earlier as part of routine surveillance after aortic-valve replacement, that had shown normal biventricular function. The size of the left ventricular chamber was normal. There was mild symmetric thickening of the left ventricular wall (12 mm; normal thickness, \u226411), a finding that was unchanged from the previous echocardiogram. No evidence of pericardial effusion was observed, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was well seated and appeared to be functioning normally. Electrocardiograms.An electrocardiogram obtained on presentation to the academic health center (Panel A) shows normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, and PR-segment depression in lead II and PR-segment elevation in lead aVR. Territorial ST-segment elevation raises the possibility of a coronary occlusion, but PR-segment deflections may indicate pericardial irritation, possibly consistent with myopericarditis. The corrected QT (QTc) interval is 425 msec. A repeat electrocardiogram obtained 4 hours after presentation (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm with persistent ST-segment elevations in leads I and aVL, with broad inverted T waves in those leads as well, and occasional ventricular ectopic beats that probably originate from the right ventricle. The QTc interval is 462 msec. An electrocardiogram obtained on the third hospital day (Panel C) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 135 beats per minute, as well as persistent ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL; the QTc interval is approximately 475 msec. An electrocardiogram obtained on the seventh hospital day (Panel D) shows normal sinus rhythm, with reduced ST-segment elevations in the lateral leads; however, regional T-wave inversion and a reduction in R-wave voltage in lead aVL are present, findings that could be consistent with transmural necrosis.", "true_dx": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and suspected myopericarditis.", "pred_dx": "Covid-19 with myocarditis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 73-year-old guy who suddenly started feeling unwell with a dry cough, fever, and fatigue.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's pretty concerning, especially since it happened so quickly.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And then, they found these ground-glass opacities in his lungs on the CT scan.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, that's often seen in viral infections like COVID-19.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, he also has some heart issues.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His echocardiogram shows that his heart isn't pumping well, and there are changes in the electrical activity of his heart on the ECG.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This combination of respiratory and cardiac problems makes me think we're dealing with something more than just a simple infection.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, let's consider the timing.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's March 2020, right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, initially, it seems like COVID-19 might be the culprit.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But hold on, the heart issues didn't show up until later.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "At first, it was just the respiratory symptoms.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Then, the heart problems popped up, and they seem to be getting worse over time.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's unusual for COVID-19, where you'd expect the respiratory symptoms to come first and maybe some heart issues if things get really bad.", "t": 5, "c": "14", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's dig deeper into the heart stuff.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The ECG shows ST-segment changes, which can mean different things, like a heart attack or inflammation around the heart muscle.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And the echocardiogram shows that his heart muscles aren't moving well, which suggests some kind of damage.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This could be myocarditis, where the heart muscle gets inflamed.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Or maybe it's takotsubo cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle temporarily doesn't work well due to stress or emotional factors.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, there's no mention of any emotional stressors here, so that's less likely.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, putting it all together, we've got respiratory symptoms followed by heart issues.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Initially, I thought it was COVID-19, but now I'm thinking it might be something else.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Could it be a viral infection that affects both the lungs and the heart?

The patient had been healthy and studying for a doctoral degree when she began having symptoms of psychosis. Her first symptom was a belief that \u201cpeople were talking about her\u201d as part of a larger \u201cconspiracy\u201d in which family, friends, and random people were part of a \u201cgame\u201d and acting out \u201cscenes\u201d for her. She had had stress associated with her schooling and had contemplated changing schools. However, she had not had other symptoms of anxiety or depression, neurovegetative symptoms, or auditory or visual hallucinations. A few months later, the patient\u2019s apartment was burglarized and vandalized; her parents were the only other people with a key, and she believed they were involved. Because of threats she made against family members, she was admitted to an inpatient state psychiatric facility. A diagnosis of psychotic disorder, possibly paranoid schizophrenia, was rendered. An evaluation for causes of the disorder revealed evidence of marked iron-deficiency anemia, including an iron level of 18 \u03bcg per deciliter (3 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 45 to 182 \u03bcg per deciliter [8 to 33 \u03bcmol per liter]), a ferritin level of 6 ng per milliliter (reference range, 11 to 306), and a transferrin saturation of 3.7% (reference range, 11.0 to 50.0). The evaluation also revealed vitamin deficiencies, including a vitamin B12level of 167 pg per milliliter (reference range, 182 to 803) and a vitamin D2level of 10 ng per milliliter (reference value, >32). Before admission to the state psychiatric facility, the patient had had no history of psychiatric disease. She had a remote history of a left-foot fracture and had undergone a right oophorectomy at 17 years of age for torsion of the ovary. She took no medications. Her mother recalled her being a \u201cperfectionist,\u201d especially during her late teenage years. The patient had reported an unintentional weight loss of 9 kg over an unspecified period of time, despite self-described polyphagia and some hair thinning. She did not have diarrhea. There was no history of head injury or seizure, menopausal symptoms after the oophorectomy, or social withdrawal. Her mother had systemic lupus erythematosus, her sister had hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, her maternal grandfather had diabetes, and an aunt had breast cancer. There was no family history of psychiatric disease. The patient had been previously employed in human resources and had lived alone. She had traveled to the southern United States, coastal Massachusetts, and New York City but not abroad. She followed a pescatarian diet that included dairy foods and an egg daily as part of a lunch salad. She drank one alcoholic beverage per month, did not smoke cigarettes but had used marijuana, and drank two caffeinated beverages daily. After a 1-month inpatient stay at the state psychiatric facility, the patient was discharged. Her medications included risperidone, sertraline, ferrous sulfate, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin C, and a multivitamin. At a routine follow-up visit 6 weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated by an internist at her primary care physician\u2019s office, who found her to be excessively thin. On examination, a thyroid nodule was identified, which prompted consultation with an endocrinologist. A biopsy of the nodule was performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed evidence of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine ablation was suggested, but the patient opted for total thyroidectomy. After the thyroid surgery and despite the administration of escalating doses of oral levothyroxine, the patient\u2019s thyrotropin level reportedly remained high (value not available) and the free thyroxine level was 0.73 ng per deciliter (9 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.80 to 1.80 ng per deciliter [10 to 23 pmol per liter]). Several weeks later, after further dose escalation of levothyroxine, the free thyroxine level was 0.80 ng per deciliter (10 pmol per liter). A limited follow-up examination that was performed by the endocrinologist 6 months after the initial consultation revealed a height of 167.6 cm, a weight of 45 kg, and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 16.1. The patient was afebrile and had a regular pulse of 75 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg. The thyroidectomy scar was well-healed, and the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. However, the patient\u2019s psychiatric symptoms were believed to be poorly controlled by antipsychotic medications, and it was unclear whether her thyroid conditions were related to her psychosis.

Six months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Images Obtained 6 Months before Current Admission.A coronal image from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel A) shows a nodule (arrow) in the paramediastinal apical segment of the upper lobe of the left lung that measures 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm. An axial image from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel B) shows bulky left hilar and left paratracheal mediastinal lymphadenopathy (arrows), with lymph nodes measuring up to 2.9 cm in diameter. An axial image from a positron-emission tomographic\u2013CT fusion scan (Panel C) shows intense radiotracer uptake (arrows) that corresponds to the lymphadenopathy. An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma. Five months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consideration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imaging was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer with his family until several days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis. When the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagulation. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visited his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker. The temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evaluation at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar, and the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potassium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was 14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.

CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measured 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhancing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal. Images Obtained on Current Admission.A coronal image in lung windows from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel A) shows a radiologically significant increase in the size of the left-lung mass, which now measures 9.3 cm by 4.6 cm. There is new mixed ground-glass opacification and cavitation in the peripheral left upper lobe (arrow). An axial image in soft-tissue windows from CT pulmonary angiography (Panel B) shows enlargement of the left hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter, as well as new right hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow), with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.9 cm in diameter. An axial image in soft-tissue windows from CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel C) shows multiple new rim-enhancing lesions involving all segments of the liver. The largest lesion (arrow), in liver segment 8, measures 8.0 cm in diameter. There is also a new lesion (arrowhead) in the body of the left adrenal gland that measures 4.1 cm by 3.4 cm. Supplemental potassium was administered intravenously and orally, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged. One week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompanied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly became volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospitalization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true. The next day, the patient borrowed his brother\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucinations. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days.

The patient had been well until approximately noon on the day of admission, when a dull, diffuse headache developed; the pain gradually increased in severity until he rated it at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He took ibuprofen, and the headache improved but did not resolve. Between 6 and 7 p.m., he smoked marijuana. At approximately 7 p.m., a friend noted that the patient suddenly leaned forward and held his head in his hands. He then stood and was noted to have heavy breathing and unintelligible speech. He appeared to be frustrated by his inability to communicate. His friends brought him to the emergency department of this hospital; he arrived at 7:43 p.m. On arrival, the patient was unable to name the place or date. He reported that he felt confused and had difficulty thinking of and saying words; he rated the headache at 3 out of 10. He reported no recent trauma, neck pain, fever, chills, chest pain, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had sickle cell anemia, which was monitored at another hospital. It was associated with infrequent crises, the most recent of which had occurred more than a year earlier; his most recent blood transfusion had occurred 22 months before this evaluation. He had been hospitalized for pain crises in the past and for the acute chest syndrome once, 6 years earlier. He had had recurrent headaches during the past 15 months; evaluation at another hospital had revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms, which were reportedly stable on serial imaging studies. He had undergone a cholecystectomy at 12 years of age. His medications included ibuprofen, as needed for headaches, and folic acid. He had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with a friend. He smoked marijuana regularly, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not smoke tobacco or use other illicit drugs. His parents were of African-American ancestry.

The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 108/51 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was conjunctival and sublingual icterus. On neurologic examination, his speech fluency was fair, with occasional paraphasic errors, mild anomia, and circumlocution. Comprehension and repetition of spoken language were almost normal, but he had severe alexia and agraphia. He followed simple commands but confused left and right. He identified individual fingers by name but was unable to perform simple arithmetic, which had previously been easy for him. Perseveration occurred when he attempted to copy alternating geometric shapes. On a test of object recall, he was able to recall none of three objects after 1 minute. On a test of semantic fluency, he was able to name four animals in 1 minute. On a test of phonemic fluency, he was able to name no words that begin with the letter F in 1 minute, and this testing resulted in tachycardia at a rate of 145 beats per minute. He had mild constructional apraxia, but praxis was otherwise intact. Coordination, gait, and cranial-nerve, motor, and sensory functions were normal, as were deep-tendon reflexes; the right plantar reflex was mute, and the left was flexor. He had a score of 3 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe deficit. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1.

On the afternoon of admission, the patient was found leaning up against a wall, unresponsive. With him was a half-filled bottle of cloudy liquid with possible pill fragments, as well as bottles of prescription medications that had been filled earlier that day, including trazodone (1 of 28 pills remaining) and risperidone, buspirone, and loratadine (each with all pills present). Emergency medical services were called. On examination of the patient in the field, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 4 on a scale of 3 to 15 (with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness); he opened his eyes in response to painful stimuli but did not move or make any sounds. The blood pressure was 108/67 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute and regular, the respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97%. The skin was pink, warm, and dry, and the pupils were 3 mm in diameter, round, and reactive to light; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. The capillary blood glucose level was 108 mg per deciliter. Oxygen (at a rate of 15 liters per minute, delivered by means of a nonrebreather face mask) and naloxone were administered, without improvement in mental status. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal. He was transported to this hospital by ambulance. The patient\u2019s history, which was obtained from his medical records, included drug use (cocaine, opiates, and benzodiazepines), anxiety, depression with multiple suicide attempts, hepatitis C virus infection, and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current medications other than those found with him on presentation were unknown. He had no known allergies. He smoked cigarettes and had been homeless and incarcerated in the past. He was divorced and had adult children; his current living circumstances were not known. On examination in the emergency department, the patient could move his arms and legs and open his eyes in response to painful stimuli, but he could not follow commands or speak; the GCS score was 8. The blood pressure was 108/67 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the temperature 36.2\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Both pupils measured 3 mm in diameter and were briskly reactive to 2 mm when exposed to bright light. The lungs were clear with normal respiratory effort, the breath sounds were diminished at the bases, the heart sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft. Within the first 45 minutes after his arrival at the hospital, the patient became increasingly agitated and combative, resisting all medical interventions; physical restraints were applied. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 86 beats per minute, with evidence of biatrial enlargement and with a PR interval of 128 msec, a QRS interval of 104 msec, a QT interval of 386 msec, and a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 461 msec. A complete blood count and blood levels of calcium and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Analysis of urine obtained by means of straight catheterization revealed a pH of 5.5 and a specific gravity of 1.008; dipstick testing was normal. Screening of a blood specimen for toxins revealed trazodone (1826 \u03bcg per liter; therapeutic range, 800 to 1600), meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (MCPP), and venlafaxine; screening of a urine specimen was negative. The poison control center advised monitoring cardiac intervals with serial ECG. Approximately 4 hours after arrival, a repeat ECG showed a QTc interval of 501 msec. Shortly thereafter, the patient vomited. Magnesium was administered. Laboratory Data. On admission, the patient had intermittent somnolence alternating with periods of increasing agitation and thrashing limbs, but he remained nonverbal and unable to follow commands. Low-dose lorazepam for extreme agitation and normal saline were administered. Increasing lower abdominal fullness developed that was consistent with bladder distention and urinary retention; an indwelling urinary catheter was placed, with improvement. On repeat blood testing 7.5 hours after presentation, blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, and troponin T were normal, as were results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. The blood pressure was 109/64 mm Hg, and the pulse 105 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal.

Two days before admission, she had nausea and several episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis in the evening, after she had eaten seafood. The day before admission, she had recurrent vomiting associated with eating but was able to drink large amounts of water. Earlier that day, she had normal interaction with friends and participated in sightseeing activities, including long-distance walking. Early in the evening, she was noted to be slightly confused. Later in the evening, her friend had difficulty arousing her from sleep, and she was not able to follow directions or walk. She was carried to a car by two of her traveling companions and taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 94/64 mm Hg, the pulse 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin and a urine drug screen were negative. The blood level of salicylate was less than 0.2 mg per deciliter (0.01 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.8 to 20.0 mg per deciliter [0.20 to 1.44 mmol per liter]), and acetaminophen 0 \u03bcg per milliliter. Intensive care was not available at the other hospital, and the patient was transferred to this hospital by helicopter. During the flight, the patient was agitated and unable to lie still. Ketamine was administered, along with normal saline and hypertonic saline. On evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and further history was obtained from her family. She was healthy and used an etonogestrel implant. She was a graduate student, resided in the southern United States, and was visiting New England with friends.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before admission, when fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy developed. Twenty-five days before admission, he went to another medical facility, where a test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative. Eight days later, a heterophile antibody test was positive and the hematocrit, hemoglobin, and blood levels of total protein, albumin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection was made. Laboratory Data. Two weeks before admission, dysphagia developed and pain and decreased hearing occurred in the right ear. On repeat evaluation, a diagnosis of otitis media was made, and prednisone (45 mg daily, for 5 days) and amoxicillin (for 2 days) were administered, followed by azithromycin (for 3 days). Eight days before admission, severe otalgia developed. On examination by an otolaryngologist, there was perforation of the right tympanic membrane, with bloody purulent material in the external ear canal. Oral cefuroxime (500 mg twice daily) and an otic suspension of topical ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone were prescribed. Two days later, increasing unsteadiness developed; the patient fell several times during the next 5 days. The day before admission, he returned to the otolaryngologist; on examination, there was an effusion in the right middle ear. Myringotomy, with fluid aspiration, was performed. After the procedure, transient unsteadiness occurred, with vomiting; ear pain lessened, and hearing partially improved. After returning home, the patient noted slurred speech, clumsiness with movements, and increasing gait imbalance. Later that night, he went to the emergency department at another hospital. Ceftriaxone (1 g) was administered, and he was transferred to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported fullness and decreased hearing in the right ear, weight loss of 4.5 kg, and persistent fatigue during the previous month, without neck stiffness, headache, photophobia, changes in vision, tinnitus, vertigo, sensory abnormalities, or difficulty with comprehension. He had a history of acne, asthma, and otitis media during childhood; he had undergone an inguinal herniorrhaphy as an infant. Medications at home included a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen for otalgia and topical benzoyl peroxide. He had no known allergies. He attended college. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His paternal grandfather had polymyalgia rheumatica at 75 years of age and a stroke at 80 years of age; there was no other family history of neurologic or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the patient was thin, alert, and oriented, with an appropriate affect. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The right tympanic membrane was perforated, with dried blood in the external canal. The tonsils were enlarged (3+) and erythematous. His speech was fluent and mildly dysarthric. Extraocular movements revealed slight saccadic undershoot, normal pursuit, and no nystagmus. Hearing (comprehension of whispered words) was slightly diminished in the right ear. He had dysmetria bilaterally on finger-to-nose testing, with end-point tremor; rapid alternating movements were irregular, and there was overshooting bilaterally when the patient attempted to follow the rapid finger movements of the examiner. Heel-to-shin testing was intact, but there was marked truncal ataxia with standing and walking. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal, including repetition and naming, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensory examinations. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, lipase, total and indirect bilirubin, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, vitamin B12, cholesterol, and lipoproteins. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain and temporal bones, performed without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B), reveals fluid in the right middle ear and mastoid air cells and hemorrhage within the right external auditory canal, findings that are consistent with the recent tympanostomy. There is no associated bony destruction, and both the roof of the middle ear and the roof of the mastoid are intact. The brain is normal in appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, performed without the administration of gadolinium, reveals opacification of the right mastoid air cells and middle ear, as well as prominent adenoids and cervical lymph nodes. No abnormality is evident in the brain, and the findings are otherwise normal. Imaging Studies.Axial (Panel A) and sagittal (Panel B) CT images in bone windows show opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid air cells, without destruction of the bony septa. The bony roof of the middle ear (tegmen tympani) (Panel B, arrow) and the bony roof of the mastoid are intact. An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image through the cerebrum from MRI performed on the second hospital day shows no abnormalities (Panel C). An axial FLAIR image through the cerebellum shows inflammation in the right mastoid air cells (Panel D, arrow) but no abnormalities in the cerebellum. No abnormal enhancement or restricted diffusion was identified in the brain during the remainder of the study. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of a lumbar puncture are shown inTable 1. The oral administration of cefuroxime (250 mg twice daily) was started by the admitting service. On the second day, repeat MRI of the brain with the administration of gadolinium was performed. Images from the MRI scan show unchanged opacification in the right mastoid air cells and middle ear (Figure 1C and 1D). There is no extraaxial fluid collection, acute infarction, mass lesion or mass effect, or signal abnormality or enhancement in the brain parenchyma. A magnetic resonance venogram shows normal flow-related enhancement in the dural venous sinuses, without evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or stenosis. A CT scan of the skull base, obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows opacification of the right middle ear and mastoid air cells, with no destruction of bony mastoid septa. The tegmen tympani and tegmen mastoideum are intact. Cefuroxime was stopped, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered intravenously, and antihistamines and metoclopramide were also administered. The patient's symptoms persisted. On neurologic examination on the fourth hospital day, the patient was awake and cooperative but inattentive, with mild anomia and impaired verbal fluency and verbal working memory. Comprehension was normal. The ability to perform simple arithmetic was impaired, and he perseverated when performing the Luria fist-palm-side test of alternating motor sequencing, which is sensitive to executive dysfunction from lesions of the prefrontal cortex.1Eye movements showed continued hypometric saccades and catch-up to both the left and the right sides. Speech was mildly dysarthric. He had hypotonia throughout. There was dysdiadochokinesia in both arms and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. There was proximal overshoot on heel-to-shin testing. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, and the patient veered to either side. He was unable to perform tandem walking and lost his balance when standing with his feet together. The remainder of the examination, which included Weber and Rinne tests and tests of visual fields, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensation, was normal.

Three weeks before presentation, fever occurred (with temperatures as high as 40.0\u00b0C), along with fatigue and malaise. The patient took acetaminophen and diphenhydramine to alleviate the symptoms. After approximately 5 days, the fever and fatigue had subsided but an erythematous, maculopapular rash had developed on the scalp. The rash lasted for 3 days and then spontaneously resolved. Three days before presentation, fever recurred, along with chills and malaise. Despite the administration of acetaminophen, the fever persisted. After 2 days, the patient sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic. His temperature was 40.0\u00b0C, and laboratory test results were notable for a platelet count of 45,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000). He was instructed to return the next day. When he returned, his temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the platelet count was 21,000 per cubic millimeter, and the serum sodium level was 124 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 146). Ibuprofen was administered orally, and he was referred to the emergency department of this hospital and was admitted for evaluation. In the emergency department, a review of systems was notable for the presence of anorexia during the previous 3 weeks and the occurrence of loose, nonbloody stools for 3 days. The patient had no weight loss, bleeding, or other gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, joint, or genitourinary symptoms; he reported no contacts with sick persons. He had no notable events in his medical history, except for an evaluation for mild bilateral gynecomastia 5 years earlier. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He worked as a manager of a craft shop. He lived in a wooded area in Massachusetts with his wife and two healthy daughters, and he ran once or twice weekly in a marshy area near his home. He had a house cat that was permitted to go outdoors. There was no history of use of tobacco or illicit substances; he consumed two alcoholic beverages weekly. He traveled to Mexico annually during the winter. His mother had had atrial fibrillation and heart failure, and his father had had lung cancer. He had one brother and one sister, and they were both healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/60 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Six hours later, the temperature was 39.3\u00b0C. The patient was described as appearing well. There was a faint erythematous, macular rash on the chest. Conjunctival erythema was present, with no icterus. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Cardiac examination revealed a tachycardic rhythm, with no murmur. Neurologic examination was normal. A circular skin lesion (measuring 1 cm in diameter) with a central scab was noted below the left lateral malleolus. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Levels of calcium, magnesium, lactate, total protein, globulin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and white-cell differential count. Tests for hepatitis A virus antibody and hepatitis B virus surface antibody were positive. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis B virus IgM antibody and surface antigen were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Samples of the blood and urine were obtained for culture, and normal saline was administered intravenously.

The patient was born by vaginal delivery to a primigravida mother at another hospital after 39 weeks of gestation; labor was induced because of intrauterine growth retardation. The birth weight was 2.3 kg (first percentile), and Apgar scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The umbilical cord was two-vessel. The patient was admitted to the neonatal ICU. Perinatal examination reportedly revealed natal teeth, retrognathia, and global hypotonia. Laboratory testing showed hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia, which resolved. Jaundice was present; a Coombs\u2019 test was negative, and the patient was treated with phototherapy. No weight gain was noted during her hospitalization. She was discharged from the ICU on the 10th hospital day. At 30 days of life, the patient was seen in the outpatient genetics clinic of the other hospital. On examination, she was reportedly in respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation between 70 and 79% while she was breathing ambient air, and she was transferred to the ICU. A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) and computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed borderline cardiomegaly, nonspecific diffuse pulmonary abnormalities, and architectural distortion of the lung parenchyma that was reminiscent of chronic lung disease of prematurity. However, since the baby was not born prematurely and was not receiving ventilatory support as a neonate but was small for gestational age, the term Wilson\u2013Mikity syndrome (pulmonary dysmaturity syndrome)1may be applied to describe the radiographic findings. An esophagram was normal, revealing no evidence suggestive of a vascular ring or vascular sling. Imaging Studies.A chest radiograph (Panel A) and a corresponding computed tomographic angiogram with coronal reformatting (Panel B) reveal borderline cardiomegaly and a prominent pulmonary arterial shadow (Panel A, arrow; Panel B, P). The dilatation of the ascending aorta can also be seen (Panel B, A). An axial image (Panel C) shows dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (P) and its left (L) and right (R) branches, as well as the ascending aorta (A). (D denotes the descending aorta.) The left main stem bronchus is compressed by dilated vessels. Diffuse multifocal pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are present, characterized by areas of hyperaeration alternating with ground-glass opacities and subsegmental lung collapse. Sagittally reformatted images (Panels D and E) show relative narrowing of the transverse aortic arch (Panel D, arrows) between the ascending aorta (Panel D, A) and the descending aorta (Panel D, D) and show patent ductus arteriosus (Panel E, arrowhead [represents direction of flow]), findings indicative of left-to-right shunting from the descending aorta into the dilated main pulmonary artery (Panel E, P). The caliber of the right ventricular outflow tract is relatively normal (Panel E, arrow); this finding is indicative of the absence of a large, intracardiac shunt. The severe degree of pulmonary-artery dilatation was interpreted as indicative of pulmonary hypertension caused by the shunt through the patent ductus arteriosus (Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome) or resulting from a primary cause (or a combination thereof). A diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure of an unknown cause was made. The patient was transferred to a second hospital. Twenty-seven days before this admission, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed at the second hospital, revealed extensive periventricular gray-matter heterotopia, a large cisterna magna, and micrognathia, with no evidence of intracranial venous thrombosis. Cranial MRI.An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows foci of heterotopic gray matter lining the right lateral ventricle (arrows). A midsagittal T1-weighted image (Panel B) shows micrognathia (anterior arrow) and a large cisterna magna (posterior arrow). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale, a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect walled off by an aneurysmal membranous septum, and an effective small left-to-right shunt without left ventricular dilatation. There was also a competent bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the intercoronary commissure, with trivial stenosis, aortic dilatation, and a large patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional flow and pulmonary arterial pressures estimated to be at systemic levels, as well as preserved biventricular function. Genetics consultation was obtained, and results of microarray testing (GeneDx) were reportedly normal. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, but she returned within 12 hours, after an episode of severe respiratory distress. A brief episode of bradycardia was observed in the pediatric department, and she was transferred to the pediatric ICU. Twenty days before admission to this hospital, an orogastric feeding tube was placed because of weight loss. Three days later, CT angiography of the chest (Figure 1B through 1E) revealed dilatation of the ascending aorta, a large patent ductus arteriosus with a relatively small-caliber transverse aortic arch and no focal coarctation, an enlarged pulmonary-artery trunk (1.6 cm in diameter), enlarged left and right main pulmonary arteries (indicative of pulmonary hypertension), and large lung volumes. Scattered bandlike and ground-glass opacities and areas of hyperaeration were seen in both lungs. Nine days before this admission, when the patient was 7 weeks 3 days of age, cardiac catheterization was performed, and the patent ductus arteriosus was closed with the use of a 6-mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II device. The pulmonary arterial pressure was 51/23 mm Hg (mean, 35), and the aortic pressure 53/24 mm Hg (mean, 36). There was no substantial change in the pulmonary arterial pressure after the ductus was closed (pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg [mean, 36]; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg [mean, 67]) or when the patient received supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 1.0 (pulmonary arterial pressure, 58/19 mm Hg [mean, 36]; aortic pressure, 89/56 mm Hg [mean, 67]). The patient was transferred back to the first hospital, which was closer to her home. Despite closure of the patent ductus arteriosus, the patient\u2019s respiratory status did not improve, and she required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water. The patient\u2019s interest in oral feedings decreased and continuous nasogastric tube feedings were begun, but no appreciable weight gain was noted. There was no evidence of inability to feed or of abnormalities on an esophagram. She was transferred to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. Medications on transfer were famotidine, furosemide, metoclopramide, and (as needed) simethicone for gastric distress and a glycerine suppository for constipation; she also received continuous nasogastric feeding with formula. The patient lived with her parents and maternal relatives. Her mother had smoked during pregnancy, had taken lamotrigine for a seizure disorder that had been diagnosed when she was a teenager, and had hyperflexible joints. She and the patient\u2019s maternal grandmother had periventricular heterotopia. A maternal half-aunt also had a seizure disorder. The patient\u2019s father had a history of depression; two paternal half-sisters were healthy. The patient\u2019s mother was of European ancestry; her father was of French and Polish ancestry. On examination, the patient\u2019s weight was 3.18 kg (below the first percentile for age), the length 48.25 cm, and the head circumference 37 cm. The maximal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C; the systemic systolic blood pressure ranged from 79 to 96 mm Hg, the diastolic blood pressure from 46 to 57 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure, 50 to 60 mm Hg), the heart rate from 120 to 140 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate from 20 to 50 breaths per minute. The sutures were open, and the facial appearance was not dysmorphic. The hair of the scalp and eyebrows was thin, and a natal tooth was present. The eyes were widely spaced, with grey\u2013blue sclera. There were bilateral fine crackles in the lungs (with more crackles in the right lung than in the left), with mild subcostal and suprasternal retractions; no associated stridor, wheezing, grunting, or nasal flaring was present. No cardiac murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft, with bowel sounds. Muscle tone was poor, and there was poor visual tracking of a toy. When the patient was asleep, the oxygen saturation decreased to between 80 and 89% while she was receiving CPAP with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm of water through nasal prongs. As she continued to receive CPAP, the Fio2increased to 0.4 and the oxygen saturation rose to greater than 95%. The next day, an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 153 beats per minute and was normal for the patient\u2019s age. On the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, we performed repeat transthoracic echocardiography, which showed the findings reported earlier: the presence of a well-situated ductal occluder device, no coarctation, no residual ductal-level shunting, and normal biventricular size and function. The effective shunting across the ventricular septal defect was small (peak interventricular gradient, 40 mm Hg), with estimated right ventricular pressures at 50% of systemic levels.

The patient had been well until 5 days before admission, when head congestion, subjective fever, chills, and a nonproductive wet cough developed. He self-administered ibuprofen and acetaminophen, without improvement. One day before admission, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/69 mm Hg, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Rales and wheezing were heard in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A posteroanterior chest radiograph was clear (Figure 1A). Chest Radiographs Obtained at the Other Hospital.A posteroanterior chest radiograph that was obtained 1 day before admission (Panel A) is clear. An anteroposterior portable chest radiograph that was obtained on the day of admission (Panel B) shows new bilateral consolidations with nodular opacification that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, a finding consistent with pneumonia. A diagnosis of bronchitis was made. Albuterol and ipratropium were administered by nebulizer, and a 4-day course of prednisone was begun. The patient\u2019s symptoms reportedly improved, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue the prednisone course, begin therapy with an albuterol inhaler, and follow up with his physician. Approximately 24 hours later, relatives took the patient back to the emergency department of the other hospital because of cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting; he reported no chest pain. On examination, he was in severe respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 51/33 mm Hg, the pulse 165 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 55 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 79% while he was breathing ambient air. His skin was ashen and mottled, and he had diffuse rales in both lungs; the abdomen was soft, and there were no cardiac murmurs or edema. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A rapid influenza diagnostic test of a nasal swab was reportedly negative. Blood cultures were obtained. High-flow oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask and normal saline were administered. The oxygen saturation rose to 89% within minutes. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral consolidations with some nodular opacification that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung; some had nodular contours. The size of the heart was normal, and no pleural fluid or pneumothorax was seen (Figure 1B). An electrocardiogram revealed a ventricular rate of 161 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. A continuous infusion of norepinephrine was begun. Thirty minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, respiratory distress persisted, with labored breathing, nasal flaring, retractions, and diminished breath sounds throughout. Treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the oxygen saturation rose to 100%; the respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, the blood pressure 102/85 mm Hg, the pulse 159 beats per minute, and the rectal temperature 40.7\u00b0C. Oseltamivir, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, clindamycin, methylprednisolone, and ketorolac were administered. Three hours 10 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival, the oxygen saturation was 88% while he was receiving treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure. He was sedated, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was begun. A triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. The patient was transported by medical helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 6 hours after his presentation at the other hospital. Additional history was obtained from family members. The patient had been well and was taking no medications until this illness developed. He had recently started spray painting buildings for work. He had no history of travel. He had visited the home of his adoptive parents the previous week; one relative had felt ill but the condition had since improved. On examination, the patient was unresponsive and cold to the touch. He had poor capillary refill while he was receiving ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen at a rate of 30 breaths per minute, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0, a PEEP of 20 cm of water, and a tidal volume of 7 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. He had intermittent agonal spontaneous breaths over the ventilated breaths, and the oxygen saturation was 82% while he was receiving ventilatory support. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, and the femoral pulses were 125 beats per minute; when measurements of systemic blood pressure were attempted, no reading could be obtained. The height was 180 cm, the weight 76.2 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. The lips were blue. The breath sounds were diminished bilaterally, with diffuse rhonchi and poor air movement. The heart sounds were distant and tachycardic, without murmurs. The skin was cool and poorly perfused; there was no peripheral edema, and the abdomen was soft. Bloody respiratory secretions were suctioned. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lactase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed amber cloudy urine, with a specific gravity of 1.013, 2+ occult blood, 1+ glucose, and 2+ albumin; the urine sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 hyaline casts and 5 to 10 granular casts per low-power field, squamous cells, and mucin. Toxicologic screening of the urine revealed cannabinoids; screening of the blood and urine for other toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. The rate of infusion of norepinephrine was increased, and dobutamine and vasopressin were added. Sodium bicarbonate, fentanyl, versed, propofol, vecuronium bromide, vancomycin, cefepime, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, and phytonadione were administered. Platelets were transfused. An indwelling catheter was placed transcutaneously into the femoral artery. Transthoracic ultrasonography, which was performed at the bedside, revealed diffuse decreased cardiac function, a decreased ejection fraction, and no evidence of right ventricular enlargement or pericardial effusion; hypotension persisted. Four hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was begun at the bedside. A portable chest radiograph that was obtained shortly after the patient was admitted to this hospital showed slight, gradual progression in consolidations bilaterally and showed the placement of an endotracheal tube, a central venous catheter, and a nasogastric tube (Figure 2A). On a radiograph that was obtained 4 hours later, an ECMO catheter was present in the superior vena cava and other findings were unchanged (Figure 2B). Chest Radiographs Obtained at This Hospital.A portable chest radiograph that was obtained on admission (Panel A) shows slight, gradual progression in bilateral pneumonia; an endotracheal tube is present in the trachea, a central venous catheter is present in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube is present in the stomach. A portable chest radiograph that was obtained 4 hours later (Panel B) shows the presence of a catheter for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation coursing through the inferior vena cava and terminating in the superior vena cava; the other findings were unchanged.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before the current evaluation, when he noticed an itchy perianal rash and rectal pain. After 2 days, the symptoms did not abate, and he sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported the perianal rash and gradually increasing rectal pain. He had been sexually active with two male partners in the previous month. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/84 mm Hg, and the pulse 80 beats per minute. Three scattered, tender, shallow ulcers and a vesicle were present in the perianal area. No rectal discharge or fissures were seen. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy was present bilaterally; there was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and orthopoxvirus infection were performed. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to await the test results. Two days before the current evaluation, test results were available. The test for HIV types 1 and 2 was nonreactive, as were the tests of urinary and rectal specimens forNeisseria gonorrhoeaeandChlamydia trachomatisnucleic acids. The blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; the results of rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing were not yet available. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of a swab specimen obtained from the perianal vesicle detected the presence of nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA. Species-specific real-time PCR testing confirmed the presence of mpox virus (MPXV; formerly known as monkeypox virus), clade II. The patient was called and instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported a new rash on his chest, abdomen, and back that was similar to the perianal rash. He reported new fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, and headache. There was no weight loss, sore throat, or cough. Numerous scattered, tender, shallow ulcers were present on the chest, abdomen, and back, in addition to five tender, umbilicated pustules and one shallow ulcer in the perianal area (Figure 1). Treatment with tecovirimat was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the sexual health clinic of this hospital. Photographs of the Skin.Photographs of the skin were obtained 2 days before the current presentation. Scattered, tender, shallow ulcers are present on the chest (Panel A), abdomen (Panel B), and back (Panel C). Several tender, umbilicated pustules and a tender, shallow ulcer are present in the perianal area (Panel D). During the next 2 days, the patient took tecovirimat. On the day of the current evaluation, he called the sexual health clinic because of redness and throbbing, pressurelike pain of the right eye. He was instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On the current evaluation, the patient reported that redness and discomfort of the right eye had started after he had been discharged from the emergency department and had increased in severity and become painful during the subsequent 2 days. He rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He did not have blurry vision, photophobia, flashing lights, or floaters. There were no symptoms in the left eye. Since the initiation of antiviral therapy, the fever, chills, and headache had resolved, and the rectal pain had decreased in severity. There was no rhinorrhea or cough. The patient had a history of syphilis, which had occurred 5 years earlier and had been treated with intramuscular penicillin G. Since receiving the diagnosis of mpox, he had learned that syphilis and mpox had been diagnosed in one of his sexual partners from the previous month. Medications included tecovirimat and valacyclovir. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and worked in the food-service industry. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He did not know his family history. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C. The uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye (normal range, 10 to 21). When proparacaine drops were administered to check the intraocular pressure, the pain in the right eye did not decrease in severity. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the right globe under the closed eyelid. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild meibomian-gland dysfunction in both eyes; there was no eyelid edema or erythema. The right conjunctiva was diffusely injected, with severe bulbar hyperemia (Figure 2A). The right caruncle was boggy and erythematous. On eversion of the eyelids, small-to-medium-sized follicles and tarsal conjunctival petechiae were observed on the right lower and upper lids (Figure 2B and 2C). The left conjunctiva was normal. The cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens appeared normal in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination was performed. The vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vasculature, macula, and periphery appeared normal in both eyes. Photographs of the Right Eye.Photographs of the right eye were obtained on the current presentation. On examination of the right eye (Panel A), diffuse bulbar and tarsal conjunctival hyperemia is present. With pharmacologic dilation of the pupil and the administration of fluorescein dye, there is no staining of the ocular surface. On eversion of the right lower and upper eyelids (Panels B and C, respectively), tarsal conjunctival and subconjunctival petechial hemorrhages (blue arrows) and small-to-medium-sized conjunctival follicles (green arrow) are visible.

Within 1 hour, the rash spread to her torso and both arms and legs. She presented to the emergency department of another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed on the basis of her clinical presentation; she was discharged home. The following day, the patient\u2019s arthralgias persisted and involved not only her fingers, hands, and shoulders but also her elbows, knees, ankles, and toes. Swelling in her wrists and hands led her to remove a bracelet and her wedding ring. Her gums bled easily when she brushed her teeth. By that evening, her fever, headache, and rash had remitted. Over the next 2 days, the arthralgias persisted but all other symptoms continued to abate. On the fifth day of illness, a new pruritic, erythematous rash developed, beginning on her palms and spreading to her arms, chest, abdomen, back, and legs, sparing the soles of her feet. The patient took ibuprofen and diphenhydramine and then presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had a remote history of appendectomy. Her only medication was a daily multivitamin, and she had no known allergies. Immunizations were reportedly current. She lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England, worked as a chemical engineer, and enjoyed running. Three days before the onset of illness, the patient had returned from a 7-day trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands, where she spent time on the beach and received multiple mosquito bites. She was monogamous with her husband, consumed alcohol in moderation, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and had no exposure to sick persons. There was no family history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 69 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. There was subtle swelling of soft tissue in the hands but no joint effusions; movement of the wrists and finger joints caused mild discomfort. There was a diffuse, erythematous, blanching, macular rash involving the abdomen, chest, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1). There were confluent macules on the palms, but the soles of the feet were spared. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The application of a tourniquet to an arm for 2.5 minutes did not precipitate the development of petechiae. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.011, a pH of 5.0, and negative results for occult blood, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, albumin, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.

The patient\u2019s mother was a 27-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) who had received prenatal care at another hospital. At 34 weeks of gestation, an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy had reportedly revealed an avascular intraabdominal cystic mass that was located near the bladder and measured 3.7 cm by 2.1 cm by 2.0 cm. A sacral dimple was noted. The patient\u2019s mother was referred to the maternal\u2013fetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis. At 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, premature labor occurred, and the patient\u2019s mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be nonreactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed. On delivery, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g (19th percentile), the length 48 cm (20th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (77th percentile). The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 7 and 9, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery. In the nursery, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was administered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter [34 to 257 \u03bcmol per liter]). A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings indicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter (0.1 mmol per liter). A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. During the next 3 days, the patient\u2019s blood glucose level remained low, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), even though the glucose infusion rate was increased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated. On the fourth day of life, she was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further treatment. On admission to the neonatal ICU, additional history was obtained. Before the ultrasonographic survey at 34 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy had been normal. The patient\u2019s mother had taken prenatal vitamins. Prenatal maternal screening had been negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, as well as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and group B streptococcal infections; there was evidence of immunity to rubella virus. The maternal ABO blood type was AB, Rh positive. The newborn\u2019s parents had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean and now lived in a suburb in New England. The patient\u2019s mother, father, and half brother were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 148 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/45 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The anterior and posterior fontanelles were flat and soft. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft without distention, tenderness, or palpable masses. Two sacral dimples with visible bases were noted. The female genitalia appeared normal, but the anus was displaced anteriorly. The blood glucose level was 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter) while the patient was receiving dextrose at a glucose infusion rate of 10.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute. The total bilirubin level was 20.4 mg per deciliter (349 \u03bcmol per liter). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography (Figure 1) revealed a large solid\u2013cystic mass anterior to the sacrum that measured 2.7 cm by 3.0 cm by 5.7 cm, with the rectum passing anteriorly to the mass. Results of spinal ultrasonography were normal, as were results of cranial ultrasonography performed through the anterior fontanelle. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, pelvis, and spine (Figure 2) showed a presacral solid\u2013cystic mass that measured 2.7 cm by 2.8 cm by 5.9 cm, with a small extension into the ischiorectal fossa on the right side. There was no evidence of abdominal lymphadenopathy or involvement of the sacral spine. Ultrasound Images of the Pelvis.A midsagittal image (Panel A) shows a complex cystic mass (arrows) anterior to the sacrum. A transverse image obtained through the superior aspect of the mass (Panel B) shows the relationship of the cystic mass (C) with the uterus (U) and the sigmoid colon (S). Consecutive transverse images obtained more inferiorly (Panels C and D) show that the mass has a complex nature, with solid components at the right margin. MRI of the Pelvis.Consecutive coronal T2-weighted, fluid-sensitive, fast spin\u2013echo images (Panels A and B) show a complex, fluid-filled pelvic mass that is not continuous with the thecal sac. Correlative axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (Panels C and D, respectively) show the complex nature of the mass, with mixed fluid-filled and solid components; a cystic component (C) is associated with an intermediate T1 signal, which is indicative of a high level of proteinaceous content. Correlative axial T1-weighted images obtained without fat suppression before the administration of gadolinium and with fat suppression after the administration of gadolinium (Panels E and F, respectively) show a poorly enhancing, solid extension of the mass (arrows) into the ischiorectal fossa on the right side. During the next few days, the patient continued to receive dextrose at a high glucose infusion rate to maintain normoglycemia. At 5 days of life, a small bowel movement occurred. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was 1173 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210) and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin level 10.7 mIU per milliliter (reference range, <1.1).

The patient had been well until 3 weeks before presentation to this hospital, when sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and chills developed. He noted areas of crusting and occasional bleeding in both nares (Figure 1). His brother had reportedly received a recent diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinical Photograph of the Nares.Three weeks before the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital, areas of crusting developed around both nares. Two weeks before presentation to this hospital, the patient had traveled by airplane to the northwestern United States for a wilderness backpacking trip. Shortly after he arrived, cramping pain developed in his left calf. Over the next 2 days, the pain worsened in severity and was associated with swelling of the calf. He presented to another clinic for evaluation. Noninvasive ultrasonography of the lower leg was performed, and the results were reportedly normal. Ibuprofen was recommended for pain control, and azithromycin was prescribed for suspected upper respiratory infection. Despite the administration of ibuprofen, the pain in the left calf worsened and limited the patient\u2019s ability to bear weight. The swelling progressed from the calf to the foot, and an erythematous rash developed on the dorsum of both feet. One week before presentation to this hospital, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease, which had been diagnosed when he was 10 years of age and had resulted in prolonged glucocorticoid use. During the previous 3 years, weekly treatment with adalimumab led to clinical improvement in his Crohn\u2019s disease and he had a considerable growth spurt, in which he gained several inches in height. During the previous several years, the patient had had multiple self-limited episodes of sore throat, nonproductive cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal crusting with associated bleeding. He occasionally used ibuprofen at home but took no other over-the-counter or herbal medications. He was a college student and resided in the central United States. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He had a sibling with Crohn\u2019s disease. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/70 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He did not appear ill but was in mild distress because of the pain in the left lower leg. The nasal crusting and the swelling of nasal mucous membranes had markedly improved during the previous 2 weeks. The nasal septum was intact, and no nasal polyps or blood were present. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was tenderness on palpation and swelling in the left lower leg from the calf to the dorsal aspect of the foot, without erythema, warmth, or pitting (Figure 2A). Synovitis of the left ankle was present. Peripheral pulses were normal. Nontender purpuric lesions, including some that were faintly palpable, were present on both lower legs but were more numerous on the left leg (Figure 2B). Two tender nodules (each 1 cm in diameter) with overlying erythema were present above the right medial malleolus (Figure 2C) and were similar to lesions the patient had had transiently in the past. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, creatine kinase, C3, and C4 were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests, the complete blood count, and the differential count. Assays for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were negative. Tests for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis C virus antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Blood cultures showed no growth. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.014 and a pH of 5.5 and with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, protein, blood, or nitrates by dipstick; examination of the sediment revealed no red cells, white cells, bacteria, or casts. The blood C-reactive protein level was 2.0 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 0.9), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, <10), and an antistreptolysin O titer 400 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 200). Clinical Photographs of the Lower Legs.On the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital, tenderness and swelling of left lower leg were present from the calf to the dorsal aspect of the foot (Panel A). Nontender, palpable purpuric lesions were present on both lower legs but were more numerous on the left lower leg and foot (Panel B). Two tender nodules (each 1 cm in diameter) with overlying erythema were present above the right medial malleolus (Panel C). Radiography of the chest revealed a normal cardiac silhouette and no consolidations or pleural effusions. Computed tomography of the tibia, fibula, and foot, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal osseous structures without fractures or cortical erosions, as well as diffuse nonspecific edema of the soft tissues of the ankle and proximal dorsal foot without abscesses or deep fascial thickening. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and diagnostic tests were performed.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever and cough developed. On the morning of admission, he noted an abrupt onset of shortness of breath at rest and dyspnea on exertion. There was also substernal chest pain on the left side that worsened with deep breaths and when he lay down. The patient\u2019s son called emergency medical services, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient described ongoing chest pain and shortness of breath. The son reported that the patient had fallen at home 2 days before admission, but the patient did not remember falling and the son was not able to provide details about the nature or circumstances of the fall. The patient reported no pain in his abdomen, arms, legs, or groin and no headache. The patient had a history of hypertension. During a previous evaluation for cough, he was reportedly told that he had a lung disease that had \u201ccaused the lung tissue to harden.\u201d Before the onset of his most recent symptoms, he had walked outside on a daily basis without limitation from shortness of breath. He took an unknown medication for hypertension. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He lived in an apartment with his wife. On examination, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/95 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute and the oxygen saturation improved to 96% with the administration of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.8. Retractions were noted in the supraclavicular areas. Inspiratory crackles could be heard at the lung bases. The heart sounds were regular, with tachycardia but no murmur. There was no tenderness on palpation of the chest wall and no edema in the legs.

Five years before this presentation, the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year, attempts to discontinue prednisone led to recurrent myalgias, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. Three years before this presentation, swelling, erythema, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear, sparing the earlobe (Figure 1). There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflammation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated. Clinical Photographs.A photograph of the posterior portion of the left ear (Panel A) obtained 3 years before this presentation shows prominent auricular edema and erythema; a small portion of the ear (the noncartilaginous portion) is unaffected. These findings are consistent with chondritis. The unaffected right ear (Panel B) is shown as a reference to highlight the degree of inflammation involving the contralateral auricle at the time of onset of chondritis. A photograph of the left eye (Panel C) obtained 15 months before this presentation shows ocular injection (i.e., redness), which was more prominent in the left eye than in the right eye, with sparing of the limbus \u2014 a finding that is consistent with scleritis. This sign was associated with ocular pain and reduced visual acuity. During the next 6 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms, along with elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13) and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Two years before this presentation, the patient began treatment with tocilizumab for fatigue, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy, and upon tapering of the prednisone dose, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examination revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonography of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However, 2 months later, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started, inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms recurred, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examination revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initiated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, methotrexate was continued, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy. During the next 6 months, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation, treatment with rituximab was initiated. However, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone, bilateral scleritis developed (Figure 1); the dose of prednisone was increased again, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; additional rituximab treatment was not administered. One year before the current presentation, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted, given its previous efficacy in this patient. However, the use of tocilizumab also resulted in moderate but transient neutropenia after each infusion. Seven months before this presentation, pleuritic chest pain on the lower left side developed, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleural effusion (Figure 2A and 2B). Thoracentesis was performed, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (performed after the pleural fluid was drained) showed a small left pleural effusion, a trace right pleural effusion, and bibasilar dependent atelectasis without consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy (Figure 2C). The pleural effusions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation, tocilizumab therapy was stopped, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imaging studies were performed. Imaging Studies of the Chest.Posteroanterior (Panel A) and lateral (Panel B) chest radiographs obtained 7 months before this presentation show a moderate left pleural effusion (arrows). A contrast-enhanced axial CT image through the thorax (Panel C), obtained after thoracentesis, shows a small left pleural effusion and a trace right pleural effusion (arrows) with bibasilar atelectasis but no consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy. Six months later, an axial CT image through the thorax (Panel D), obtained without intravenous contrast enhancement, shows a small left pleural effusion (arrows) that is larger than it was on the previous CT image.

On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.2. There was no scleral redness or erythema of the helix of the ear. The heart sounds were regular. Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema, joint swelling or tenderness, purpura, petechiae, or deficits in motor strength. The patient had a history of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cecum, which had been diagnosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy (attributed to the oxaliplatin therapy), hypothyroidism, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been present for 3 years before this presentation, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred intermittently over the course of the 10 years preceding this presentation but were most pronounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendronate, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, folic acid, levothyroxine, methotrexate, omeprazole, prednisone, rivaroxaban, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasionally; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired.

The patient had been well until the day before admission, when fussiness, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, associated with decreased oral intake. He was taken to the emergency department at another hospital, where diagnoses of dehydration and gastroenteritis were made. He was treated with ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered. His condition markedly improved, and he was discharged home, with instructions to his parents to follow up the next day with a pediatrician. That evening, the patient's parents noticed that the boy had respiratory grunting, increased work of breathing, progressive somnolence, and refusal of oral intake, without further stool output. The next morning, on the day of the current presentation, he was difficult to arouse and had recurrent vomiting and decreased urination. His parents took him to the pediatrician's office, where he appeared lethargic, with rapid respirations; emergency medical services (EMS) were called. The patient was in respiratory distress, with grunting and labored abdominal breathing. The blood pressure was 134/70 mm Hg, and the pulse was 177, regular, and strong; the respiratory rate was 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99% while he was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. The skin was pale, warm, and diaphoretic; the lungs were clear, and the extremities were limp. The weight was 14 kg. The blood glucose level was 231 mg per deciliter (13 mmol per liter). The patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient's history was obtained from the parents through a foreign-language interpreter. The patient was born without complication after a full-term gestation and had previously been healthy. His immunizations were current; he was receiving no other medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and 3-year-old brother, who had been ill recently with similar but less severe symptoms. The parents reported no other contacts with ill persons and no ingestions; there were pill bottles at home, but all were closed and in a childproof drawer. On examination, the patient was moaning and minimally responsive, with writhing movements and withdrawal from pain. The temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 124/76 mm Hg, and the pulse 172 beats per minute; hyperpneic (Kussmaul) respirations were variable at a rate of 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 98% while he was breathing oxygen at 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask. The pupils were 3 mm in diameter, round, and reactive. The abdomen was distended and diffusely tender, with hypoactive bowel sounds. There were bounding pulses, with decreased capillary refill time. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Trace stool obtained on rectal examination was guaiac-negative. Monitoring and supportive measures were initiated. A bolus of normal saline was infused and was followed by an additional bolus because of hemodynamic instability. Blood levels of calcium, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Ceftriaxone and ondansetron were administered, as were morphine sulfate for analgesia and lorazepam for agitation. Laboratory Data. Consultation with pediatric surgeons was obtained. A radiograph of the chest was normal; an abdominal radiograph showed mild, diffuse gaseous distention and no evidence of bowel obstruction or pneumoperitoneum, and abdominal ultrasonography showed no evidence of intussusception. Rapid respirations and moaning continued, despite analgesia and anxiolytic medications. A nasogastric tube was placed because of increasing abdominal distention, and some coffee-grounds material was aspirated from the stomach; famotidine was administered. In addition, an infusion of 5% dextrose in a solution of 0.45% normal saline and potassium chloride was started after the infusion of a third bolus of normal saline.

Eight days before admission \u2014 and 3 days after her husband had begun to have fatigue, a nonproductive cough, and a fever \u2014 the patient started to have chills, a sore throat, a nonproductive cough, and myalgias. After 2 days of progressive symptoms, she contacted her primary care physician. A telemedicine visit was arranged as part of a local public health strategy to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during the pandemic. The patient reported that she had rib soreness with coughing, as well as a temperature of 35.3\u00b0C. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was suspected. Rest, isolation measures to reduce viral transmission, and increased oral intake of fluid were recommended, along with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan\u2013guaifenesin as needed. Three days later, she had diarrhea and back pain, but the coughing had become less frequent. During a follow-up telemedicine visit, the primary care physician recommended that the patient take acetaminophen as needed for back pain and counseled her to seek in-person medical evaluation if symptoms worsened. Three days later, the patient started to have chest pain that was different from the rib soreness with coughing; the chest pain was present at rest and was accompanied by new dyspnea. She called emergency medical services. On the initial evaluation, the heart rate was 116 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient reported feeling weak, light-headed, and feverish, with chills. She reported that the chest discomfort felt like pressure, was primarily located in the anterior chest, and was mild in intensity but worsened with deep inspiration or coughing. She also reported nausea and a few episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. She had received an influenza vaccine 6 months earlier. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for gastroesophageal reflux disease with histologic evidence of intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, chronic abdominal bloating and constipation, mild obstructive sleep apnea, subclinical hyperthyroidism, uterine cysts, and depression. Medications included trazodone and acetaminophen as needed. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had immigrated to the United States approximately 20 years earlier. She lived in New England with her husband and teenage children. She worked as a custodian but had no known exposure to dust, allergens, or solvents. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had hypertension and a myocardial infarction; her father had died of genitourinary cancer, and multiple paternal relatives had a history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 103 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/51 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.7. The patient appeared pale and slightly diaphoretic. She was able to speak in full sentences but appeared lethargic. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The heart was tachycardic, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) and no gallops (S3or S4). There was mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness on palpation. The legs were cool to the touch. The remainder of the examination was normal. Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was administered intravenously. Point-of-care cardiac ultrasonography revealed severely depressed left ventricular function. The left ventricular wall thickness was normal; the left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated (Figure 1A; also seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). A trace pericardial effusion was visible. Studies Obtained on Presentation.A point-of-care cardiac ultrasonographic image (Panel A) shows that the left ventricle is mildly dilated, with a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension of 55 mm (dashed line), which suggests that the cardiac dysfunction is acute. The left ventricular wall thickness is normal, with an interventricular septal wall thickness of 9 mm (double arrow). An electrocardiogram (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, low QRS voltage, and submillimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL. A chest radiograph (Panel C) shows clear lungs, without evidence of focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema. Computed tomographic angiographic images of the chest obtained in the pulmonary angiographic phase (Panels D and E) show excellent opacification of the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries but poor opacification of the left side of the heart and aorta, which suggests cardiac dysfunction (Panel D). Scattered, predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities in the lingula, the right middle lobe, and both lower lobes are present (Panel E), as is a trace pleural effusion. Although the pulmonary findings are nonspecific, they are suggestive of inflammation or infection that, in this clinical context, is likely to be due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On blood testing, human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and free thyroxine were normal, as were the prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and partial-thromboplastin time; other test results are shown inTable 1. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for testing, and blood was obtained for culture. Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were administered.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, submillimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL, and low QRS voltage (Figure 1B). Results of chest radiography were normal (Figure 1C). One hour after the administration of intravenous fluids and antibiotic agents, hypotension persisted and treatment with intravenous norepinephrine was initiated. The patient had a brief episode of unresponsiveness in the context of worsened hypotension, and intravenous dobutamine was added. Repeat bedside cardiac ultrasonography revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction, a small anterior pericardial effusion, and a dilated inferior vena cava without respirophasic variation; the left ventricular wall thickness was normal. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Images of the heart and great vessels showed excellent opacification of the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries but poor opacification of the left side of the heart and aorta due to prolongation of the pulmonary circulation time, which is suggestive of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1D). Radiographically significant coronary-artery calcification was absent. Images of the lungs showed a few scattered, predominantly peripheral ground-glass opacities in the lingula, the right middle lobe, and both lower lobes (Figure 1E), as well as a trace pleural effusion.

The patient had been well until approximately 11 weeks before this admission, when subjective fevers with sweats, fatigue, decreased appetite, and nausea developed. He initially attributed these symptoms, which worsened over the next 2 months, to the hot weather. Cough and shortness of breath on exertion also developed during that time, and the patient noted that his urine appeared foamy. He reportedly lost 9 kg. Twenty-two days before this admission, the patient presented to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation. The blood creatinine level was 0.8 mg per deciliter (71 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the blood urea nitrogen level was 7 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter; normal range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]). The patient left the hospital without being evaluated by a physician. The patient returned to the emergency department at the other hospital 1 week later (15 days before this admission) and reported that he had been having malaise, vomiting, and chest pain for the past 2 days. The chest pain worsened during inspiration. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was breathing ambient air. He had hearing aids in both ears and nontender, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally, and faint rhonchi were heard at the base of both lungs on auscultation. The abdomen was soft and flat, with mild, diffuse tenderness on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lipase, and lactic acid; the results of other laboratory tests are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine with a specific gravity of 1.037, a pH of 5.0, a moderate amount of occult blood, a protein level of at least 500 mg per deciliter, a glucose level of 50 mg per deciliter, and a ketone level of 20 mg per deciliter by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells and 10 to 25 white cells per high-power field and a moderate amount of hyaline casts. An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of cardiac ischemia. Laboratory Data. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild subpleural interlobular septal thickening without lobar consolidation or evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature rose to 37.9\u00b0C, and he reported malaise. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and acetaminophen was administered. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. Intravenous fluids were administered. By the next day, the chest pain had resolved. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and lactic acid; the results of other laboratory tests are shown inTable 1. Noninvasive ultrasonography of both legs was performed and did not reveal evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A prominent inguinal lymph node (1.5 cm by 0.6 cm by 1.5 cm) was seen on the right side. On ultrasonography of the abdomen, there was borderline enlargement of the spleen, which measured 13.3 cm in length (normal range, \u226412). The right kidney measured 12.3 cm in length, and the left kidney measured 12.4 cm in length; markedly echogenic renal parenchyma was present bilaterally (Figure 1A). Abdominal Imaging Studies.An ultrasound image (Panel A) of the upper abdomen shows increased echogenicity of the renal cortex in the right kidney (arrowheads), as compared with normal echogenicity of the adjacent liver (asterisk). Increased echogenicity of the renal cortex was also present in the left kidney (not shown). Coronal and axial CT scans (Panels B and C, respectively) of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without the administration of contrast material. Both images show persistent bilateral enhancement of the kidneys, which is related to the previous administration of contrast material. The axial image also shows mild left paraaortic lymphadenopathy (Panel C, arrow). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 to 65% and no pericardial effusion. The administration of intravenous fluids was continued. On the third hospital day, the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, C3, and C4; tests for antiproteinase 3 antibodies and antimyeloperoxidase antibodies were negative. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, amber urine with a specific gravity of 1.040, a pH of 5.0, a moderate amount of blood, a protein level of at least 500 mg per deciliter, a glucose level of 50 mg per deciliter, and a ketone level of 20 mg per deciliter by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells and 10 to 25 white cells per high-power field, few white-cell clumps, and occasional hyaline casts. The urinary creatinine level was 298 mg per deciliter (normal range, 20 to 370), and the urinary total protein level was higher than 2500 mg per deciliter (normal range, 5 to 25 [other hospital]). CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed patchy atelectasis of the lung bases, mild left paraaortic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, persistent bilateral enhancement of the kidneys (related to the previous administration of contrast material), and trace free fluid in the pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C). A diagnostic test result was received, and medical therapy was initiated. During the next 8 days, edema of the lower legs developed. Furosemide, calcium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, and a multivitamin were administered. The patient continued to produce urine. Laboratory test results obtained on the 11th hospital day (5 days before admission) are shown inTable 1; furosemide was discontinued. The next day, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. The patient underwent three sessions of hemodialysis during the next 4 days. On the 16th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that the leg swelling had improved and that he felt well. He had a history of anxiety. When he was 7 years of age, he was struck by a motor vehicle as a pedestrian; thereafter, progressive bilateral hearing loss developed. Before admission to the other hospital, the patient had been taking no medications; he had an allergy to ibuprofen, which caused a rash. He worked as a laborer and lived with a friend in an urban area of New England. He had separated from the female partner with whom he had two children, and he had sex with men and women. He had never received a transfusion of blood products. Approximately 6 weeks earlier, he had been in a fistfight with another person, and blood from that person made contact with open wounds on his hands and near his eyes. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for the past 15 years, and he used marijuana; he did not drink alcohol or use other illicit drugs. His mother had coronary artery disease, and he did not know his father; there was no known family history of kidney disease. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/93 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The weight was 82 kg. A hemodialysis catheter exiting the right chest was present, and there was 2+ pitting edema of the legs to the mid-shins; the remainder of the examination was normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown inTable 1. During the first 24 hours, the patient drank 890 ml of fluid and had 4425 ml of urine output. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity of 1.008, a pH of 8.0, 3+ glucose, 2+ protein, and 1+ blood by dipstick, as well as 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. The urine osmolality was 277 mOsm per kilogram of water (normal range, 15 to 1150). The urinary level of creatinine was 47 mg per deciliter, total protein 368.5 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0 to 13.5 [this hospital]), microalbumin 194.5 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0 to 2.0), and sodium 84 mmol per liter.

The patient was in her usual good health until 10 days before admission, when, after eating at a restaurant, she had nonbloody, nonbilious emesis that she attributed to food poisoning. The vomiting persisted for 2 days and then resolved. One day later, bilateral abdominal pain developed; the pain waxed and waned for a few days. She then completed a 2-day driving trip as part of her relocation to New England for a new job. During the trip, she had watery, nonbloody diarrhea every time she tried to eat (about four times per day). Her travel companion ate foods that were similar to the foods she ate but was well. After the patient arrived at her final destination, chills, fevers, and \u201csharp\u201d abdominal pain in both lower quadrants, with bloating, developed. She took naproxen every 8 hours for the pain and noted some improvement. She had minimal appetite, and she noted that the frequency of the diarrheal episodes decreased when her eating decreased. However, abdominal pain persisted and intensified until she rated it as 9 to 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Two nights later, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea, and chills. On arrival, the patient reported nausea and increased abdominal pain without further episodes of emesis. There was no hematochezia, melena, vaginal discharge, dysuria, or foul-smelling urine. Menarche had occurred at 12 years of age. Her menstrual periods occurred in normal 30-day cycles; her most recent menstrual period had been 2 weeks before this presentation. She had had no known contact with persons who were ill. She had no chest, flank, back, or neck pain, no dyspnea, and no swelling or pain in the calves. She had not lost weight. The patient had a history of a 1-cm ovarian cyst, which had been identified during her early teenage years. She was of East Asian descent, had lived in the Midwest for the previous 10 years, and worked in a medical field. At presentation, she was taking no medications except naproxen, as well as ibuprofen for pain during menstruation. She had no known drug allergies. She did not smoke or use alcohol or illicit drugs. She had never been sexually active. Her father had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. There was no family history of cancer.

Her body was well developed. She appeared to be uncomfortable except when she was lying flat. She appeared to be flushed, but there was no scleral icterus or rash. She had tachycardia, but the cardiac examination was otherwise normal. The abdomen was mildly distended, with tenderness in both lower quadrants that was worst in the midline; there was voluntary guarding on palpation but no rebound, and bowel sounds were diminished. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of magnesium and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Two sets of blood culture specimens and a urine culture specimen were obtained. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar opacities.

The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when shortness of breath developed. Approximately 3 months before admission, she began to awaken at night with chest tightness associated with fever, coughing, and dyspnea on exertion. She was evaluated in the emergency department at another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed abnormalities in the lower lobe of the left lung, and a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made; oral antibiotics were administered. Increasing dyspnea and cough developed 2.5 months before admission. A fluticasone\u2013salmeterol combination inhaler and an albuterol inhaler were administered, with minimal improvement. Three weeks before admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed at the other hospital revealed a moderate pericardial effusion, prominent pulmonary arteries, and scarring in the lower lobe of the right lung. A 2-week course of prednisone was administered, with some improvement in cough and energy, with resolution of chest tightness, but with dyspnea, which occurred with minimal activity and increased at night (requiring several pillows to sleep) and occasionally at rest. Other symptoms included early satiety, decreased appetite, hoarseness, and leg swelling. She referred herself to this hospital's Women's Heart Health Program outpatient clinic because of her progressive symptoms and pericardial effusion. The patient reported cough productive of white mucus, dyspnea on exertion and when lying on her back, dry mouth for 3 months, heartburn and mild dysphagia, intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea for 3 months, and hair thinning without alopecia. She also had had symmetric pains in her knees, elbows, and metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joints for approximately 3 years, which were worse in the morning and had recently improved with prednisone therapy. During the previous 14 months, she had an intentional weight loss of more than 45 kg; during the past 4.5 months, she had a weight gain of 10 kg. She had had Raynaud's phenomenon for 1.5 years, eczema since the age of 14 years, and anemia of uncertain cause. On evaluation the previous year, examination of a biopsy specimen of a left axillary lymph node had been benign. She had had cellulitis caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) the previous year and herpes zoster three times in the past. Other daily medications included a multivitamin, vitamin D and iron supplements, and calcium acetate. She had taken phentermine in the past. She was allergic to penicillin, latex, and mushrooms. She was married, had children, and had lived in the midwestern and southern United States and New England. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hyperlipidemia and thyroid disease, her father was deceased, and her children were healthy. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and had a persistent cough while speaking, which worsened when she moved from a chair to the examining table. The blood pressure was 158/120 mm Hg, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The height was 171.5 cm, the weight 91.6 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 31. The jugular veins were distended to 10 cm above the right atrium while the patient was lying in a mildly inclined position, and heart sounds were distant, without murmur, rub, or gallop. There was cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, a swollen left proximal interphalangeal joint, leg edema to the knees, a violaceous macule (1 cm by 1 cm) on the left inner thigh, and no cyanosis or clubbing; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 115 beats per minute, right-axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, Q waves in the inferior leads, low voltage, and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed. The parasternal long-axis view of the echocardiogram (Figure 1A) reveals a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion and thickening of the left ventricular walls, features consistent with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular function was within the normal range. Color Doppler imaging shows the absence of aortic-valve and mitral-valve disease. The parasternal short-axis view at the base of the heart reveals a dilated pulmonary artery and branches. Color Doppler imaging of the pulmonary valve shows mild regurgitation. M-mode imaging of the pulmonic valve (Figure 1B) shows systolic notching, also known as the \u201cflying W sign,\u201d a feature that suggests pulmonary hypertension. The parasternal short-axis view at the level of the midventricle (Figure 1C) shows flattening of the ventricular septum, also known as the \u201cD sign,\u201d a feature that suggests elevated right ventricular pressures. The apical four-chamber view (Figure 1D) shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle was hypokinetic. Color Doppler imaging reveals mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 91 mm Hg. The echocardiogram also shows no physiological evidence of tamponade and no congenital lesions that may give rise to a left-to-right shunt. (SeeVideos 1 through 4, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Echocardiographic Imaging.The parasternal long-axis view shows a mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion (Panel A, arrow) and thickened left ventricular (LV) walls, features suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy. An M-mode tracing of the posterior pulmonary valve leaflet in the parasternal short-axis view at the base of the heart (Panel B) shows systolic notching (arrow), known as the \u201cflying W sign,\u201d which indicates pulmonary hypertension. In the parasternal short-axis view at the midventricular level (Panel C), interventricular septal flattening (arrow) during systole, known as the \u201cD sign,\u201d is a finding consistent with increased pressure in the right ventricle (RV); pericardial effusion is also evident (arrowhead). The apical four-chamber view (Panel D) shows an enlarged right atrium (RA) and right ventricle relative to the left heart chambers. LA denotes left atrium. The patient was transferred from the clinic to the emergency department at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 201/147 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was able to speak in complete sentences. The complete blood count showed a red-cell distribution width of 18.1% (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5) and was otherwise normal; the peripheral-blood smear revealed 2+ anisocytosis and hypochromasia; the white-cell differential count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of tests of coagulation and liver function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, thyrotropin, troponin T, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate; testing for troponin I, rheumatoid factor, and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and trace protein by dipstick and 0 to 2 red cells and few bacteria per high-power field and was otherwise normal; urine pregnancy testing was negative. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional imaging studies were performed. Laboratory Data. The chest radiograph shows enlargement of the right, left, and main pulmonary arteries (Figure 2A). A CT scan of the chest and a subsequent pulmonary CT angiogram confirm enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and no evidence of pulmonary emboli. The right ventricle is enlarged; the wall of the right ventricle is thick (5 mm), with flattening of the interventricular septum. The right atrium is dilated, and there is reflux of intravenous contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A small pericardial effusion is present. There is bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy but no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear, with no evidence of interstitial lung disease or emphysema. The airways appear normal (Figure 2B, 2C, and 2D). A ventilation\u2013perfusion lung scan was normal. Thoracic Imaging.A chest radiograph (Panel A) shows enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and of the right and left pulmonary arteries. There is peripheral pruning of the pulmonary vessels, with enlargement of the right atrium. An axial image from a pulmonary CT angiogram (CTA) confirms enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, which measures 3.8 cm just proximal to its bifurcation (Panel B). In another axial image from the CTA, hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall, flattening of the interventricular septum, and right atrial enlargement (Panel C) are seen. A coronal image from the CTA (Panel D) shows reflux of contrast material into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins (black arrow), with a small pericardial effusion (arrowhead); multiple enlarged left axillary lymph nodes are present (white arrow). There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. During the patient's first 3 days in the hospital, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and furosemide were administered; systolic blood pressures decreased to between 120 mm Hg and 140 mm Hg. On the third hospital day, diagnostic right heart catheterization was performed. The right heart catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, with elevated right atrial pressure and markedly reduced cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation, features indicating right ventricular failure (Table 2).

The patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal aspect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Figure 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy. Clinical Photographs.Photographs of the patient\u2019s left hand show violaceous bullae on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth digit (Panel A) and the distal interphalangeal joint of the second digit (Panel B), each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Panel C). On further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the left hand and arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal soft-tissue swelling overlying the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger on the dorsal aspect of the left hand (Figure 2). There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging. Imaging Studies.CT of the left hand was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Sagittal images centered on the second digit and the fourth digit (Panels A and B, respectively) show focal soft-tissue swelling (arrows) overlying the second distal interphalangeal joint and the fourth proximal interphalangeal joint on the dorsal aspect of the hand. Coronal images centered on the second distal and fourth proximal interphalangeal joints (Panels C and D, respectively) show no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effusion, or fluid collection. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the left hand (Panel E) also shows focal soft-tissue swelling (arrows) overlying the second distal and fourth proximal interphalangeal joints. A three-dimensional image of the bones (Panel F) shows no abnormal features. While the patient was in the emergency department, additional history was obtained. The patient was not taking any medications and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history. The patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before presentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been prepared the day before and left to stand overnight. While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infusion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdomen, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred. Two previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yelling and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intubation to prevent a reaction. The patient identified heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares. Medications included intravenous diphenhydramine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previously taken intravenous morphine daily; however, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an inability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclopramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status. The patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years earlier. She was a student in a graduate program at a university in the United Kingdom and had returned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother had acute intermittent porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frustrated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neurologic examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine specimen was obtained for measurement of the urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, the hemin infusion was continued, but the patient\u2019s symptoms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dislocation. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.

The patient had been born at another hospital by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks 3 days of gestation. The pregnancy had been complicated by maternal obesity. The patient was placed with an adoptive family immediately after birth. Her birth mother had received prenatal care, and screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B virus had been negative; a screening test for immunity to rubella virus was positive, as was a screening test for group B streptococcal colonization. Spontaneous rupture of membranes, which occurred 2 hours before birth, revealed meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and five doses of penicillin were administered before delivery. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.9 kg (87th percentile), the length 51.5 cm (80th percentile), and the head circumference 36.5 cm (85th percentile); the vital signs and physical examination were normal. A diet of organic cow\u2019s milk\u2013based infant formula with a probiotic was begun shortly after birth; the patient drank the formula avidly, and urine and stool output were normal for her age. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests (i.e., a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism) and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congenital heart disease were normal, and the patient received intramuscular vitamin K, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment, and a hepatitis B immunization before discharge. Five days before this admission, at a routine pediatric examination, the patient\u2019s adoptive parents reported that she had been drinking 60 ml of formula every 3 to 4 hours, with some \u201cspit ups,\u201d and that she produced four yellow-brown stools each day. She appeared well, with mild jaundice, and was scheduled to return 10 days later for another routine appointment. One day before this admission, nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred after each feed. The baby was fussier and less active than usual and drank only 30 to 45 ml of formula per feed before falling asleep, as compared with the 90 to 105 ml per feed she had had the previous day. Her father called the pediatrician during the evening and was advised to take the baby to the emergency department at another hospital. On presentation to the other hospital, the patient was alert and responded appropriately to physical examination. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 85/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.5 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken; the remainder of the examination was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed. Samples of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained for culture. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus and rotavirus were negative. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed orange urine, with a pH of 5.0, a specific gravity higher than 1.030, 3+ protein, and 2+ bilirubin. A chest radiograph was normal. Multiple attempts to place an intravenous catheter were unsuccessful; ampicillin and ceftriaxone were administered intramuscularly, and an enteral electrolyte solution was administered through a nasogastric tube and did not cause vomiting. Early during the following day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) at this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Laboratory Data. The patient had lived with her adoptive family in an urban area of New England since birth. Her biologic half-brother had autism and eczema and had undergone placement of tympanostomy tubes. The patient had no known exposure to sick persons. On admission to this hospital, the results of physical examination were unchanged. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 10% dextrose in water with 0.225% normal saline. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 84 mg per deciliter (4.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 60 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.3 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). Ampicillin and cefepime were administered intravenously. Tests for respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was fed a cow\u2019s milk\u2013based formula, and vomiting recurred. Enteral feeding was stopped, the administration of intravenous fluid was continued, and vomiting ceased. The next day, the physical examination was normal. The results of an acylcarnitine profile analysis were normal, as were the results of blood amino acid analysis, with the exception of an alanine level of 582 nmol per milliliter (reference range, 139 to 474). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.008, and 1+ glucose. An electrocardiogram was normal. An upper gastrointestinal series showed severe spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux; there was no evidence of intestinal malrotation. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed mild pyelectasis in the left kidney and was otherwise normal; limited abdominal ultrasonography revealed no evidence of pyloric stenosis. The cultures of blood, urine, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid that had been performed at the other hospital remained negative, and ampicillin and cefepime were discontinued. Oral administration of an electrolyte solution was begun and did not cause vomiting. On the third hospital day, the patient was transferred to the pediatric unit. Her home diet of an organic cow\u2019s milk\u2013based formula with a probiotic was resumed. Overnight, she vomited once, approximately 2 hours after a feed. Vomiting after feeds continued during the next day. A diet of an oral electrolyte solution was resumed, and vomiting ceased. On the fifth hospital day, oral administration of an amino acid\u2013based formula was begun and did not cause vomiting. The results of repeat newborn blood-spot screening tests were reported as normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Over the next 2 days, the patient continued to receive the amino acid\u2013based formula without vomiting; the administration of intravenous fluid was stopped. Laboratory test results obtained on the sixth and seventh hospital days are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day, at which time the weight was 3.4 kg. Three days after discharge, the patient was seen for follow-up by her pediatrician. Her parents reported that she had had five episodes of spitting up during the previous 24 hours, that she had appeared tired and pale, and that her oral intake had decreased, such that she had consumed only 5 to 25 ml of the amino acid\u2013based formula per feed that day. She was also producing frequent loose, small-volume, greenish stools (10 in a 24-hour period); during the bowel movements, borborygmi were audible and the patient arched her back. On examination, the patient appeared pale and sleepy but aroused during the examination. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 132 beats per minute, and the weight 3.0 kg. The anterior fontanelle was sunken, the lips were dry, skin turgor was decreased, and the capillary refill time was between 2 and 3 seconds. The patient vomited once in the clinic. The point-of-care blood glucose level was 98 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter). The patient was fed an oral electrolyte solution and then was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and her skin appeared ashen; she cried weakly and without tears. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 73/50 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 58 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Samples of blood and stool were obtained for culture. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a pH of 6.0, a specific gravity of 1.030, and 2+ protein by dipstick; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU. A bolus of normal saline was administered intravenously, followed by a continuous infusion of 5% dextrose with sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride. The patient received an oral electrolyte solution without vomiting. The next day, a central venous catheter was placed; abdominal radiography, which was performed to assess its position, revealed an abnormal bowel-gas pattern with narrowing of the lumen and separation of the bowel loops, findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening or ascites (Figure 1A). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed fluid-filled bowel loops with thickened walls (measuring up to 3 mm in thickness), as well as a small amount of associated free intraperitoneal fluid in the right half of the abdomen (Figure 1B and 1C). Imaging Studies.An abdominal radiograph (Panel A) shows narrowing of the lumen and separation of bowel loops in the right half of the abdomen (arrows), findings suggestive of bowel-wall thickening.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admission, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 1A). Imaging Studies Obtained before Admission.A CT scan of the abdomen obtained 8 months before admission (Panel A) shows marked hepatosplenomegaly. A chest radiograph obtained 1 month before admission (Panels B and C) shows bilateral, perihilar, diffuse ground-glass opacities with additional patchy opacities at the lung bases and no evidence of pleural effusion. Seven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling developed; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the patient\u2019s abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-function test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 (portal and periportal) fibrosis. Special stains for organisms (acid-fast and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver stains) were negative. CT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme level. Four months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patient\u2019s abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone. Three months before this admission, the patient stopped prednisone therapy because of irritability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patient\u2019s liver function revealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of methotrexate was increased to 25 mg per week. During the next month, the patient noted fatigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases (Figure 1B and 1C). Levofloxacin was administered. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepatosplenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day. On the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported progressive dyspnea on exertion and being unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills. The patient had a history of preeclampsia,Helicobacter pyloriinfection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had undergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and prednisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculosis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds (S1and S2) were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The level of alanine aminotransferase was 38 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 100).Streptococcus pneumoniaeandLegionella pneumophilaantigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 2C) showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest (Figure 2D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a background of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions. Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis obtained on admission to this hospital (Panels A and B) show persistent hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense lesion in the spleen (Panel B, arrow). A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph (Panel C) shows progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. A CT scan of the chest (Panel D) confirms these findings and also shows new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrexate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.

The patient had received a diagnosis of thymoma at another hospital 5 years earlier, after a chest radiograph had been obtained to evaluate acute pain in the left shoulder. The chest radiograph showed a large mediastinal mass and left pleural effusion (Figure 1A). Subsequent computed tomographic (CT) scans showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass that measured 10.0 cm craniocaudally, 10.1 cm transversely, and 5.0 cm anteroposteriorly (Figure 1B), as well as left pleural soft-tissue nodules, a pleural effusion, and associated atelectasis (Figure 1C).18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography revealed uptake in the mediastinal mass and left pleural nodules that was suggestive of pleural metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was unremarkable. Imaging Studies.Imaging studies were performed 5 years before this presentation. A frontal radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows a mediastinal mass (arrows), with rightward tracheal deviation and a left pleural effusion. An axial, contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest (Panel B) shows an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass abutting the main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta (arrows) and a left pleural effusion. An axial, contrast-enhanced CT scan of the lower thorax (Panel C) shows nodular thickening of the left pleura (arrows), a small left pleural effusion, and associated atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Repeat studies were performed 13 days before this presentation. An axial, contrast-enhanced CT scan of the pelvis (Panel D) shows circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and prominence of the vasa recta (inset). Further studies were performed on presentation. An axial, contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest (Panel E) shows a median sternotomy wire and retrosternal surgical clips (encircled), findings consistent with thymectomy, as well as circumferential nodular pleural thickening involving the mediastinal pleura (arrows), a finding consistent with known metastatic disease. Flexible bronchoscopy with video-assisted thoracoscopic evaluation of the left lung and pleural space was performed. Pleural-biopsy specimens showed nests of epithelioid tumor cells, some with numerous admixed lymphocytes separated by thick, hyalinized fibrous bands (Figure 2); these features are diagnostic of type B2 thymoma, with areas of type B3 thymoma. Flow cytometry revealed immature T cells that were consistent with thymocytes. Pleural-Biopsy Specimen (Hematoxylin and Eosin).At low magnification (Panel A), lobular nests of epithelioid tumor cells are visible, some with numerous admixed lymphocytes separated by thick, hyalinized fibrous bands; these features are diagnostic of type B2 thymoma. At high magnification (Panel B), some areas of scant lymphocytes are visible, and the tumor cells have vesicular chromatin, small nucleoli, slightly irregular nuclear membranes, and well-defined cytoplasmic borders, features that are consistent with type B3 thymoma. Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein were normal. A chemotherapy regimen of doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide was administered for three cycles, and then a thymectomy was performed. The resection specimen was a yellow, necrotic mass that measured 6.5 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.0 cm; no viable tumor was seen on microscopic examination. No measurable disease was present in the pleura. Thirteen months after the patient\u2019s initial presentation, follow-up CT of the chest revealed new nodular left pleural thickening, a finding that was suggestive of metastatic disease. Thereafter, the patient was monitored with serial scanning. Approximately 2.5 years before this presentation, episodes of nonproductive cough developed that persisted for a few minutes at a time and were occasionally associated with vomiting and pain in the right lateral chest wall; there was no dyspnea at rest. Pathological examination of a core-needle biopsy specimen of the left pleura confirmed the presence of metastatic thymoma. A multiplexed polymerase-chain-reaction assay followed by single-base extension analysis revealed no mutations in any of the 68 tested loci from 14 cancer-associated genes (see theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Additional chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide was administered, followed by sunitinib; there was transient improvement in the cough. The treatment course was complicated by several episodes of fever and cough (at least three of which were documented as bacterial pneumonia) and intermittent oral thrush. Six months before this presentation, treatment with an investigational agent \u2014 a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoform \u03b2 \u2014 was begun. At the end of the second and fourth cycles of therapy, restaging scans showed stable disease. Four weeks before this presentation, at the end of the fifth cycle, diarrhea developed, and episodes increased in frequency to 10 to 12 liquid stools daily, each with an average volume of 250 ml; there was occasional nausea and vomiting, despite administration of loperamide hydrochloride, a solution of deodorized tincture of opium (10 mg of morphine equivalent per 1 ml of solvent), and diphenoxylate\u2013atropine. Stool color reportedly varied in relation to oral intake; there was no abdominal pain, hematochezia, or melena. Thirteen days before this presentation, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mild circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and prominence of the vasa recta, findings that were suggestive of inflammation (Figure 1D). Enlarging celiac lymphadenopathy was suggestive of progression of metastatic disease. CT of the chest that was performed on the same day revealed that the pleural and pulmonary nodules had not changed; these findings were consistent with stable thoracic metastases (Figure 1E). The blood uric acid level was 11.4 mg per deciliter (678 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 3.6 to 8.5 mg per deciliter [214 to 506 \u03bcmol per liter]). The investigational agent was stopped after a total of five cycles of therapy, without subsequent improvement in diarrhea. Six days later, 1 week before this presentation, testing of a stool specimen forClostridium difficilewas negative, and a stool culture did not grow any enteric pathogens. One week later, the patient was seen in the outpatient oncology clinic of this hospital because of persistent diarrhea. He reported slight nausea without vomiting, fever, or chills, as well as poor appetite, increased fatigue, persistent chest-wall pain, nocturnal headaches, dyspnea when climbing stairs, and dryness of the lips and mouth and the skin of his hands. He had lost 9 kg of weight in the past month. Medications were allopurinol, a solution of deodorized tincture of opium (0.6 ml four times daily), hydromorphone, guaifenesin, diphenoxylate\u2013atropine, potassium chloride, and, as needed, benzonatate for cough. He was allergic to vancomycin and omeprazole. He worked in a retail setting. He did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His paternal grandfather had had cancer, possibly of the prostate; other family history was noncontributory. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The abdomen was soft, with slight tenderness on deep palpation of the upper right quadrant and without guarding or rebound. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Three weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not performed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean corpuscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. Eleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea recurred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion. Neuroimaging Studies.An initial axial CT image of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel A), shows no acute intracranial abnormality. There was no large infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. The following day, magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed. Axial T2-weighted images show chronic infarcts in the right thalamus (Panel B, arrow) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Panel C, arrow). An axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel D) shows no areas of restricted diffusion that would suggest an acute infarction. Maximum-intensity-projection images were obtained from three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial circulation (Panel E) and gadolinium-enhanced MRA of the neck (Panel F). The images show no high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the major intracranial or cervical arteries. A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus (Figure 1B) and right cerebellar hemisphere (Figure 1C). There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Figure 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Figure 1E and 1F). Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 2A and 2BandVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg. Echocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.On transthoracic echocardiography (Panel A), a parasternal long-axis view shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets, a finding suggestive of vegetations (arrow). An apical three-chamber view on transthoracic echocardiography (Panel B) again shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets on the atrial surface. A transesophageal echocardiogram (Panel C) shows the vegetations (arrow) on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines. There was associated mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation (not shown). Coronal (Panel D) and sagittal (Panel E) CT images of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show an enlarged heterogeneous uterus (Panel E, arrow). An axial CT image of the pelvis (Panel F) shows calcified uterine masses (arrows) that were consistent with fibroids. LA denotes left atrium, LV left ventricle, and MV mitral valve. On the third hospital day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (Figure 2CandVideos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines that were consistent with vegetations. Cultures of blood were obtained, and heparin was administered intravenously. On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour intervals when the partial-thromboplastin time exceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Additional cultures of blood were obtained. Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clustered nodules in the lower lobes that were probably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On a review of systems, she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or facial droop and noted no other neurologic symptoms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparoscopies and two laparotomies, including salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertilization; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abortion at 25 years of age. During her second pregnancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hypertension developed, followed by placental abruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate. She had no known medication allergies. The patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Figure 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis.

The patient had a history of migraine headaches, sensorineural hearing loss, and chronic proteinuria. He had been in his usual health until approximately 2 years before presentation to this hospital, when his wife noted subtle changes in his personality and behavior, including short-tempered and argumentative reactions that \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense.\u201d One year before presentation to this hospital, headache, malaise, and fatigue occurred for approximately 1 week, followed by the sudden onset of difficulty speaking; over a period of several hours, he progressed from being able to use well-formed but incorrect words to being completely unable to speak and partially unable to write. Later that day, he was admitted to another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed 1 year, 10 months, and 7 months before the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital (Figure 1). All the studies revealed global brain parenchymal volume loss that was far more advanced than would be expected for a patient of this age. On the first study (Figure 1A), T2-weighted images showed a mildly expansile, hyperintense intraaxial lesion that was centered in the anterior left temporal lobe and extended posteriorly and superiorly into the inferior parietal lobule. This lesion disproportionately involved the subcortical white matter, although the cortex was also affected. There was no evidence of associated restricted diffusion or magnetic susceptibility effect and no abnormal enhancement on contrast-enhanced images. On the two subsequent studies (Figure 1B and 1C), the lesion maintained similar signal characteristics but decreased in size; in fact, the third study revealed that the lesion had resolved almost completely. The results of magnetic resonance angiography and venography were normal. MRI Studies of the Brain Obtained before Presentation.Axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of the brain were obtained 1 year, 10 months, and 7 months (Panels A, B, and C, respectively) before the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital. A hyperintense lesion, which is centered in the anterior left temporal lobe (arrows), is largest on the first image, markedly smaller on the second image, and almost completely inapparent on the last image. On the patient\u2019s admission to the other hospital, 1 year before presentation to this hospital, laboratory testing revealed mild anemia, with a mean corpuscular volume of 65 fl (reference range, 79 to 92); other test results, including the results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis, are shown inTable 1. A diagnosis of stroke was made, and therapy with aspirin and a lipid-lowering agent was begun. The patient was discharged home. His language abilities gradually improved over the next 2 months but did not return to baseline, and his headaches persisted. Laboratory Data. One month after discharge, while the patient was at home, he had a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure that was witnessed by his wife. Therapy with levetiracetam was begun, and no further seizure activity occurred. During the next 11 months, he had fluctuating focal neurologic symptoms, rapidly progressive cognitive decline, weakness, and gait instability, along with nearly daily diffuse headaches, muscle cramps in his calves, and weight loss of 11 kg. One month before the patient\u2019s presentation to this hospital, blood levels of cholesterol and lipids and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. During the 2 weeks before presentation, the patient\u2019s wife noted that his behavior had become more childlike, with rambling speech, impulsivity, and anger. His gait, balance, and coordination worsened, although he did not fall, and swallowing difficulties developed. He was referred to the neurology clinic at this hospital. The patient was right-handed. He had congenital short stature. When he was 25 years of age, sensorineural hearing loss (worse on the right side than on the left) developed; it gradually worsened and led to the use of hearing aids. Proteinuria was noted when he was 25 years of age. In the past, a clinical diagnosis of gout had been made after an episode of swelling and pain in the left big toe. Medications were levetiracetam, lisinopril, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was married, had a young child, and had lived in the southwestern United States until 3 weeks before this presentation, when his family moved to be near relatives in New England. He was a lawyer but had been receiving disability benefits since the onset of this illness. He drank alcohol in moderation and smoked tobacco occasionally. His mother was of French Canadian and Irish descent; she had reportedly had lupus nephritis with antinuclear antibodies, diabetes mellitus, and colitis and was described as needing rest frequently when walking. His father was of Hungarian and Italian descent and had diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. A maternal aunt and uncle had diabetes mellitus, and the same uncle also had sensorineural hearing loss. He had nine siblings who ranged in height from 150 to 163 cm; some were reportedly well and others had mild gastrointestinal dysmotility or symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss, anxiety, and \u03b2-thalassemia trait. On examination, the patient appeared cachectic. The blood pressure was 112/72 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. His weight was 40.5 kg, and his height 152 cm. During the examination, he reached out to grab the examiner\u2019s hand and glasses inappropriately. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 25 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30 (with higher scores indicating better cognitive function); points were deducted because the patient made errors of visuospatial function, repetition, and fluency and incorrectly identified a glove as a hand and a feather as a leaf. He had ataxic dysarthria with telegraphic speech and frequent tangential ramblings that were difficult to interrupt. The optic disks were flat and without pallor. The visual fields were normal on confrontation testing. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive, without Horner\u2019s syndrome or a relative afferent pupillary defect. Upward gaze was markedly restricted, lateral gaze moderately restricted, and downward gaze mildly restricted in each eye. There was mild bifacial weakness and markedly impaired hearing bilaterally, even while the patient was wearing hearing aids. There was minimal weakness of shoulder abduction bilaterally. The muscle bulk, tone, and strength of the neck and limbs were otherwise normal, without tremor, other adventitious movements, or fasciculations. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger and heel\u2013knee\u2013shin testing revealed subtle dysmetria; rapid alternating movements were slightly irregular. No truncal ataxia was present while the patient was seated. He swayed prominently while he stood with his feet together and eyes closed. His gait was mildly ataxic, and he could not take more than two tandem steps without losing his balance. The remainder of the neurologic and general examinations was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a mild secondary carnitine deficiency, which was thought to be dietary. The lactic acid level was initially normal but subsequently increased and remained elevated; the highest level was 8.3 mmol per liter (75 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]).

The patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy. During the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation. In the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, approximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Figure 1). Family History.Shown is a representation of the patient\u2019s family history obtained at presentation. The black square with the arrow indicates the patient. Shading indicates family members with a balance or gait disorder. Slashes indicate deceased family members. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and attentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pursuit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild intention tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed symmetric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the position of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with considerable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methylmalonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed abnormal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modified barium-swallow evaluation. A previous workup at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of malabsorption. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was 8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus. MRI of the Head.An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) and an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel B) obtained at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles show moderate cerebellar volume loss without focal signal abnormality. A sagittal T1-weighted image (Panel C) shows moderate volume loss in the superior vermis, mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and a ratio of midbrain to ventral pons of 0.51. A parasagittal T1-weighted image (Panel D) shows moderate volume loss in the cerebellar hemispheres, predominantly the superior aspects.

The patient had been generally well until approximately 5 weeks before this admission, when fever (to a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C), chills, cough, night sweats, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia occurred. Four weeks before this admission, he was seen by his physician, who noted that he had had a weight loss of 5 kg in the previous 7 months. Urinalysis and cultures of urine and blood were reportedly negative. A chest radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, were reportedly negative and were not available for review. The diarrhea resolved, but other symptoms persisted. Three weeks before this admission, CT of the chest reportedly revealed diffuse symmetric fine interstitial reticular lung nodularities, small pleural effusions, and mild splenomegaly. Two days later, the patient fell because of profound weakness and was admitted to another hospital. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (with previous bypass grafting), congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease (with previous aortofemoral bypass surgery), non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gout, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He also had transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder that was in remission after treatment including bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy, which had most recently been administered 7 months earlier. Medications taken at home were sitagliptin, metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, atenolol, clopidogrel, finasteride, dutasteride, terazosin, allopurinol, citalopram, folate, a multivitamin, and ipratropium\u2013albuterol (by inhalation). On examination, the temperature was 39.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/82 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air and 97% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. There was abdominal distention, with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a horseshoe kidney and a mildly heterogeneous liver. A chest radiograph showed a patchy opacity in the right midzone (Figure 1A). Transthoracic echocardiography reportedly revealed no evidence of endocarditis. During the first week, testing was negative for influenza antigen, as well as for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,Borrelia burgdorferi, ehrlichia,Anaplasma phagocytophilum, babesia, rickettsia (Rocky Mountain spotted fever), parvovirus, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Cultures of the blood and urine were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and aspirate, which was performed because of the pancytopenia, was normal. Diffuse bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema developed; fluid was restricted, and furosemide administered. Chest Radiographs.A frontal chest radiograph that was obtained on admission to the other hospital (Panel A) shows a patchy opacity in the right midzone. A follow-up frontal chest radiograph that was obtained 5 days later (Panel B) shows a persistent patchy opacity in the right midzone and diffuse reticular opacities in the lung bases. Laboratory Data. On the fifth day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent patchy opacity in the right midzone and diffuse reticular opacities in the lung bases (Figure 1B). The next day, a CT scan of the chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs; the ground-glass opacities in the dependent lower lobes were more confluent. There were also small bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. On the 9th day, hemoptysis occurred, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 1 liter per minute. The rate of oxygen supplementation was increased to 3 liters per minute. Bronchoalveolar lavage reportedly revealed no evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or malignant cells; cultures of the lavage fluid were negative. After consultation with a rheumatologist, methylprednisolone (1 g daily) was administered for 3 days, followed by prednisone (60 mg daily). The fevers initially improved but then recurred. On the 15th day, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. Pathological examination of a lung-biopsy specimen reportedly revealed extensive noncaseating granulomatous inflammation and granulomas in both bronchiolocentric and lymphangitic distributions. On the 18th day, hemoptysis recurred, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 86% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air. A second CT scan of the chest (Figure 2) revealed persistent diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticulations in the lower lobes bilaterally; these findings were now visible because of the decrease in size of the bilateral pleural effusions. There was evidence of wedge resections of the right upper and lower lobes and subcutaneous emphysema. Chest CT Scans.Axial CT scans of the chest show diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticulations in the lower lobes bilaterally (Panel A, arrowhead), as well as subcutaneous emphysema related to the recent lung biopsy (Panels A and B, arrows). Vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered. The day before this admission, confusion developed, with associated myoclonus during sleep and a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C. Lumbar puncture and CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were performed; the studies revealed atrophy but no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or space-occupying masses. The dose of glucocorticoid therapy was decreased. On the 22nd day, a chest radiograph showed a persistent opacity in the right midzone and subcutaneous emphysema. Ethambutol, rifampin, and isoniazid were administered. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was transferred and admitted to this hospital. The patient was allergic to contrast dye. He lived alone and had retired from the construction industry, with past exposure to asbestos. He had a 46-pack-year history of smoking and had stopped 10 years earlier; he had stopped drinking alcohol 20 years earlier and did not use illicit drugs. He had traveled to Mexico in the remote past. His son, who lived nearby, owned chickens. He was a hunter and had had exposures to deer, rabbits, and pheasants in the previous 5 months. His father and brother may have had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the patient appeared to be mildly uncomfortable and was flushed. The respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air; the other vital signs were normal.

The patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it to continue ringing. Two hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evaluation, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dextrose infusion was started. The patient\u2019s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a \u201cdreamlike\u201d state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission. Review of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He reported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department. Two years earlier, the patient had had an episode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy and was treated with prednisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). The patient took vitamin B12and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin. On examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. On arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter). The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 year before admission, when olfactory hallucinations (including sulfur and burning odors) developed, along with associated nausea. Episodes occurred every few days and lasted for approximately 2 minutes. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, transient daily episodes of numbness and paresthesias on the left side began. Results of a neurologic examination performed at another hospital were reportedly normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly revealed a partially enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed extension of the abnormality into the insula and basal ganglia. Levetiracetam was administered for management of suspected focal seizures, and the patient was referred to this hospital for evaluation. The patient was right-handed. He had pain associated with left molar caries (for which a root canal was planned) and a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. He reported no changes in his skin or vision, joint pain, dry mouth, decreased lacrimation, or respiratory symptoms. During childhood, he had had ophthalmologic surgery on his left lens after an injury. Medications included levetiracetam and dextroamphetamine. He had no known allergies. He lived alone and worked in an office. He drank alcohol in moderation, had smoked cigarettes briefly more than 10 years earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. He was of both African-American and Caribbean ancestry, was born in the United States, and had not traveled to the Caribbean. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases, malignant tumors, or migraine headache. On examination, there were postsurgical changes in the patient\u2019s left pupil; the right pupil was reactive to light. The remainder of the examination was normal, including examination of the visual fields, strength, coordination, and balance. A complete blood count and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose and results of coagulation and renal-function tests. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and met the voltage criteria for left-ventricular hypertrophy in the precordial leads. A chest radiograph was normal. MRI of the head was performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1). An irregularly marginated and nodular focus of enhancement was present along the medial right temporal lobe, extending into the adjacent tissue of the right cerebral peduncle and abutting the right middle cerebral artery. FLAIR-imaging sequences showed only a moderate amount of abnormal signal in the brain parenchyma adjacent to the enhancing foci. Sagittal and coronal views also showed leptomeningeal nodules of enhancement along the inferior margin of the right basis pontis and, more inferiorly, along the right side of the medulla oblongata. MRI of the Head.Axial, coronal, and sagittal images (Panels A, B, and C, respectively), obtained after the administration of contrast material, show enhancing nodular and partially infiltrating foci of abnormality affecting the medial right temporal lobe and adjacent structures (arrows), as well as leptomeningeal foci along the right basis pontis and medulla oblongata (arrowheads). An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel D) shows only a moderate amount of abnormal signal in relation to the temporal focus of abnormality (arrow).

Twelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and balance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left-hand to right-hand dominance. Two years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been associated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and symmetric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fingers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present. Needle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal stenosis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1). The patient underwent physical therapy, and her symptoms stabilized.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Three months before this admission, weakness in the right hand and right arm developed. The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with moving to a different apartment. However, the weakness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were stable, with no recent falls. On examination, there was reduced facial expression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and reduced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduction. There was predominantly proximal weakness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5 on shoulder abduction and external rotation, 4+/5 on elbow flexion, and 4/5 on elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was otherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dysmetria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reported to be normal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrinsic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5, without cord compression. Repeat needle electromyography revealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical paraspinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the amplitudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor responses of the right median and right ulnar nerves. During the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm.

The patient had been well until 2 days before admission, when he choked while eating a piece of chicken during dinner. He became fearful of swallowing and was unable to finish the meal despite cutting his food into small pieces. The next day, he vomited after trying to eat ice cream, and his daily fluid intake decreased to only 710 ml (24 oz) of water. He reportedly needed his mother near him throughout the day and had an \u201cirrational fear\u201d of choking. He had not had recent fevers, rhinorrhea, cough, or sore throat. Nine days earlier, during a routine annual examination at the clinic of the patient\u2019s primary care pediatrician, the patient\u2019s mother reported that he had had several episodes of inspiratory stridor while he was sleeping during the past few weeks; the patient was referred to an otolaryngologist, but this visit had not yet occurred. On the day of this presentation, the patient consumed only small sips of water, reported feeling hungry, and slept most of the day. His mother noted that, in addition to the inspiratory stridor during sleep, the patient had some gasping for air that was associated with deep involuntary burping. She contacted a physician at this hospital and was advised to bring the patient to the emergency department for evaluation. The patient had been delivered at full term. He had a nuchal cord at birth, and the birth weight was 3.6 kg. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 9, respectively, and initial resuscitation efforts were provided. Subsequent growth and development were reportedly normal. As an infant, the patient had had gastroesophageal reflux and a milk-protein allergy, and he had received some training on sensory-integration skills during childhood. Immunizations had been administered through 2.5 years of age; after that age, the recommended routine vaccinations were refused by the patient\u2019s parents. The patient had keratosis pilaris and eczema. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He lived with his family in a suburb and was a student who received writing support. His younger brother had moderate autism spectrum disorder, with verbal (but not conversational) skills, and had received diagnoses of PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) and vitamin D deficiency. Both parents were healthy. The patient\u2019s maternal grandfather had heart disease and non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, his maternal grandmother had had psoriasis and had died from breast cancer, an aunt had hypoglycemia, and his paternal grandmother had hypertension, hypoglycemia, and congestive heart failure. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was alert and appeared to be anxious. He had persistent involuntary burping, with evidence of drooling on his shirt. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/64 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the weight 54.1 kg (60th percentile for his age), and the height 160 cm (32nd percentile for his age). The oral mucosal membranes were dry. Sexual development was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). Results of examinations of cranial nerves II through XII were normal. The patient spoke clearly, and his gait, strength, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal. The remainder of the examination was also normal. His initial laboratory studies revealed profound hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, but other laboratory test results were normal, including blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase, as well as titers of antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ischemic changes. The corrected QT interval was reportedly mildly prolonged, at 471 msec. Laboratory Data. Because the patient had severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and supportive care.

One week before this presentation, the patient was seen by a pediatrician at another medical facility for a routine annual examination. He had a history of a mass in his right breast that had been present for 18 months and had recently enlarged. On examination, a round, mobile mass was palpable under the right areola. He was referred to the pediatric endocrinology clinic of this hospital. One week later, at the visit to the endocrinology clinic, the patient\u2019s parents reported that, approximately 18 months earlier, they had noted a mass under the right nipple that was not associated with discharge. The mass had reportedly enlarged in the 6 months before this presentation, and growth of fine pubic hair was also noted. The patient had seasonal allergies and eczema and was otherwise well. He had a history of normal growth and development. His only medication was topical triamcinolone cream for eczema; his childhood vaccinations were current. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his parents and younger sibling and was doing well in second grade. His maternal grandfather had asthma, his maternal grandmother had hypercholesterolemia, and his paternal grandmother had breast cancer (which had been diagnosed when she was 70 years of age); his parents and younger sibling were healthy. On examination, the patient did not have dysmorphic features. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the height 131 cm (68th percentile), the weight 28.4 kg (72nd percentile), and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 16.5 (66th percentile). The abdomen was soft and had some palpable bowel loops. A firm, mobile mass (2 cm by 2 cm) was present under the right areola and was not adherent to the skin. A small amount of soft breast tissue was palpable on the left side. Fine, straight, lightly pigmented hairs were present on the lower mons pubis, and on close inspection, very scant fine, light axillary hairs were also present. The testes had an estimated volume of 3 ml; the phallus was prepubertal. The remainder of the examination was normal. Findings on a radiograph of the left hand were consistent with a bone age of 8 years. Eight days after this visit, laboratory tests were performed; the test results are shown inTable 1. Thirteen days after this visit, imaging studies of the chest were performed. Laboratory Data. Ultrasound examination of the right breast (Figure 1) revealed a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped, relatively hypoechoic, mobile mass (measuring approximately 1.4 cm by 1.3 cm by 0.8 cm) with through-transmission in the retroareolar region. The mass had smooth peripheral margins and was superficial to the pectoralis muscle; its long axis was parallel to the skin and horizontal in orientation. On color Doppler imaging, the mass was relatively hypovascular and had minimal peripheral-blood flow. The mass did not have irregular spiculated margins, calcifications, or increased vascularity, features that are typically seen in aggressive cancerous lesions. Examination of the contralateral breast revealed a normal left breast bud. Ultrasound Images of the Breasts.Ultrasound images of the right breast, obtained in transverse and sagittal planes (Panels A and B, respectively), show a well-circumscribed, oval mass with smooth margins in the right retroareolar region; the mass is \u201cmore wide than tall\u201d (i.e., the transverse diameter is greater than the anteroposterior diameter). A color Doppler image (Panel C) shows that the mass is relatively hypovascular and has minimal peripheral-blood flow, as well as through-transmission (arrow). A side-by-side comparison of the right breast and the left (normal) breast (Panel D) shows the mass in the right breast (asterisk) and the normal left breast bud (arrowhead).

The patient had been well until approximately 5 days before admission, at 28 weeks of gestation, when she noted feeling warm, which she attributed to a malfunctioning air-conditioning system at work. Three days before admission, malaise and headaches occurred. The next day, she called her health care providers about her symptoms and reported Braxton Hicks contractions and frequent fetal movement, with no fevers, vaginal bleeding, or leaking of fluid. She was advised to rest and increase her fluid intake. That night, she took diphenhydramine for sleep. The day before admission, she came to the outpatient obstetrics clinic of this hospital because of a temperature of 37.4\u00b0C. She reported decreased fetal movement at home, which improved on arrival to the clinic. She was taking prenatal vitamins. She was allergic to cephalexin and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which caused a rash, and to multiple fruits and vegetables, which caused anaphylaxis. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable uterine contractions. On a nonstress test, the average fetal heart rate was 125 beats per minute, with moderate variability and positive accelerations; these findings were interpreted as reassuring. On ultrasonography, fetal biometric measurements were consistent with a weight of 1244 g (51st percentile for 28 weeks 4 days of gestation), and there was appropriate gradual growth since a previous scan had been obtained, as well as a normal volume of amniotic fluid; the fetus was active. Later that day, the patient traveled to a coastal area in Massachusetts that she visited weekly. That evening, increased fatigue, diffuse body aches, low back pain, and an earache occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.6\u00b0C. The obstetrician who was on call that evening recommended that the patient go to a local emergency department for evaluation; the examination was reportedly normal. There was a platelet count of 125,000 per cubic millimeter, and a peripheral-blood smear showed no evidence of babesia; other laboratory test results were reportedly negative. Results of testing for Lyme disease were pending. The patient returned to her coastal vacation residence. Overnight, the temperature rose to 38.8\u00b0C. On the morning of admission, the patient called her obstetrician\u2019s office at this hospital to report fever, with a current temperature of 37.4\u00b0C. She was advised to take acetaminophen, drink fluids, rest, and return for evaluation if she began feeling worse. Later that day, the temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C and nausea developed. That evening, she presented to the labor and delivery unit of this hospital. On presentation, the patient reported mild headache, neck stiffness, a left earache, intermittent contractions, and a possible erythematous rash on her right shin; she had no joint symptoms, vomiting, ear drainage, hearing difficulty, or upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary symptoms. She was gravida 3, had had two previous spontaneous miscarriages, and had received prenatal care, with testing that was positive for rubella-specific antibodies and negative for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. The patient had a history of thrombophilia and gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with aspirin use and was heterozygous for factor V Leiden. She reported contact with an indoor cat at home and with outdoor cats and dogs at the home of relatives; she knew of bats in the vicinity of her home and mice in the basement of her coastal vacation residence. She had no known sick contacts, insect bites, or consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. She had traveled to Western Europe, Central America, Mexico, and Asia within the previous 3 years. She worked in an office, had stopped smoking 5 years earlier, and had stopped drinking alcohol when she became pregnant. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, and the fetal heart rate was 130 beats per minute, with accelerations. There was a faint area of lacy, blanching erythema (4 cm in diameter) on the right shin and no lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell indexes and results of coagulation tests were normal, as were blood levels of creatinine, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, uric acid, and haptoglobin. Thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears of peripheral blood were negative for babesia; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. Laboratory Data. During the next 4.5 hours, the temperature rose to 38.9\u00b0C. Ceftriaxone and rifampin were administered. During the next 3 days, results of testing for hepatitis A and B viruses were suggestive of protective immunity, and results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus were suggestive of past infection; testing was negative for cytomegalovirus nucleic acids, HIV, heterophile antibodies, and IgM and IgG antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferi,Coxiella burnetii, ehrlichia, and anaplasma.

The patient had been in her usual health until 18 months before this admission, when paresthesia developed in the feet. Sixteen months before this admission, the patient underwent lumbar surgery, including laminectomy and facetectomies at L3\u2013L4 and bilateral foraminotomies at L4. After surgery, she reported that the symptoms in the feet had diminished. Nine months before this admission, hypoesthesia and weakness recurred in the feet; over a period of several months, they spread to involve the legs and hands. The patient had several falls at home and began to use a cane and then a wheelchair. Eight months before this admission, she was evaluated at an outpatient neurology clinic, and electromyography and nerve-conduction studies were performed. A presumptive diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was made, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered; the patient reported transient improvement in sensation and strength in her legs and hands. During the next 6 months, IVIG was administered every 4 weeks, but hypoesthesia and weakness progressed to involve both arms. When she was no longer able to transfer safely into a wheelchair, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported inconsistent bowel and bladder continence and progressive hypoesthesia and weakness in her legs and arms. She had a history of chronic low-back pain (which had been treated with opioids), fibromyalgia, headaches, and depression. Surgeries included appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy in the distant past, as well as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass approximately 4 years earlier. Medications included controlled-release morphine sulfate, hydrocodone with acetaminophen, gabapentin, diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, valproic acid, citalopram, cyanocobalamin, and cholecalciferol. The patient was married, lived with her husband in New England, and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of autoimmune disease; her father had a history of bladder cancer. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 138/66 mm Hg, the pulse 64 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx had no erythema or exudate; the patient was edentulous, with a normal-appearing oral mucosa and tongue. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal (although the first cranial nerve was not tested). Strength was 0\u20131 out of 5 in the legs and 3 out of 5 in the arms. Sensation to pinprick was decreased in both legs, from the toes to the hips. Negative inspiratory force at functional residual capacity and vital capacity were normal. A stage 2 pressure ulcer was present over the sacrum. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12(cobalamin), and vitamin B9(folate) were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 and hepatitis C virus were negative. The blood level of valproic acid was 15.3 \u03bcg per milliliter (therapeutic range, 50 to 100). Urinalysis was unremarkable. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted images showed mild abnormalities in the periventricular white matter, a finding consistent with a chronic small-vessel ischemic process. Valproic acid was stopped, high-dose methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology department of this hospital for evaluation. Laboratory Data. On examination at this hospital, results of a mental-status examination (including tests of language, attention, and memory) were normal. There was no voluntary movement in the legs; there was atrophy of the calf and foot muscles. Weakness was more severe in the hands than in the proximal arms. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ at the ankles, 3+ at the patellas, and 3+ at the biceps. Perception of vibration, light touch, and pinprick was absent in the legs and diminished in the arms. Sensation to pinprick was impaired caudal to the T4 level. The plantar reflex was absent bilaterally. A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, with a moderate, diffuse increase in immune globulin. Screening tests for antitreponemal antibodies and for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiand human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Nerve-conduction studies and needle electromyography were performed. The nerve-conduction studies revealed normal sensory responses, apart from a mildly reduced amplitude of the right ulnar nerve. Fibular motor responses could not be elicited in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle in either leg; fibular motor responses were severely reduced in the tibialis anterior muscle in both legs, as were posterior tibial motor responses in the abductor hallucis muscle. Distal motor latencies and velocities were normal. Needle electromyography revealed scattered fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in two muscles in the right arm and two muscles in the right leg. The patient was unable to activate units in several muscles in the arms and legs. In other muscles, there was a reduced number of normal-appearing motor units and slow firing of those units, findings suggestive of impaired activation. MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild scattered degenerative changes of the spine, with no evidence of cord compression, nerve-root impingement, or a demyelinating process. A lumbar puncture was performed for analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); results are shown inTable 1. Hypoesthesia and weakness in the arms and legs did not improve, and the results of a neurologic examination were unchanged from those obtained on admission.

The patient was born in China. At 7 months of age, she underwent emergency tracheostomy after a caustic injury from either ingestion or inhalation. At 2.5 years of age, she was adopted by an American family and moved to the United States. Her adoptive parents noted that she had stridor and snoring, and her pediatrician referred her to an otolaryngologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) at 2 years 10 months of age. On examination, the nasopharynx was completely obstructed; there was fusion of the posterior tongue and hard palate and of the hard palate and epiglottis, with a narrow opening in the oropharynx. The supraglottic passage was normal beyond the stenosis; the subglottic airway was not evaluated. A tracheostomy was performed, and the left nasal choanal obstruction was opened with a laser. Repeat bronchoscopy revealed that the larynx and subglottic trachea were normal. On two occasions, esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no evidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The tracheostomy tube was removed when the patient was 5.5 years of age; there was a residual tracheal\u2013cutaneous fistula. When she was 7.5 years of age (7 months before this admission), another tracheostomy was performed because of worsening oropharyngeal stenosis that precluded intubation and because of concern about possible obstruction. The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 6.5 weeks before this admission; during a 10-day period, her mother noted recurrent blood-tinged sputum in the tracheostomy tube, and an episode of bleeding at the tracheostomy site occurred at school. The patient was seen in the emergency department of the MEEI, where a flexible tracheoscopy, which was performed at the bedside after removal of the tracheostomy tube, revealed no exposed blood vessels or granulation tissue in the trachea or stoma. A chest radiograph showed consolidation in the right lower lobe, which was thought to be due to aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis. Gram\u2019s staining of the sputum showed abundant neutrophils, abundant gram-positive cocci in pairs and a few chains, abundant gram-negative diplococci, a few gram-positive rods, and a few thin gram-negative rods. Culture of the sputum from the tracheostomy tube grew methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus,Moraxella catarrhalis,Haemophilus influenzae, andStreptococcus pneumoniae. The patient remained afebrile, and no antibiotic agents were administered. She was admitted overnight for observation and discharged home the next day (5 weeks before this admission). She had one more episode of blood-tinged sputum thereafter. During the 2 weeks before this admission, the oxygen saturation, which was obtained during continuous overnight monitoring for sleep apnea, fell to approximately 85% (from the usual level of approximately 95%) for prolonged periods. Examination at school revealed decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. One day before this admission, while the patient was being bathed, her mother noticed that her chest was asymmetric, with the right nipple appearing lower than the left, and that blood vessels were prominent on the right side of the chest. At the pediatrician\u2019s office the next day, the patient described a recent episode of discomfort in her chest that occurred while she was being hugged. There was no history of respiratory distress, fevers, or cough. On examination, she was tearful and hesitant. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, and a tracheostomy tube was in place. The right lateral chest wall was more prominent than the left, had no crepitus, and was tender to touch. Breath sounds were normal on the left side and diminished on the right. The right upper quadrant of the abdomen was diffusely tender, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred to another hospital for chest radiography, which revealed a large pleural effusion on the right side, with underlying pneumonia. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had sleep apnea and a history of dental caries that necessitated the extraction of several deciduous teeth between 5 and 7 years of age. Immunizations, including the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), were current; she had reportedly received the bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine at 1 month of age. A purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was negative on her arrival in the United States. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived at home with her adoptive parents and siblings; she was physically active, did well in school, and was able to breathe, speak, and eat normally, with the tracheostomy tube capped while she was awake. She lived with two dogs and a cat, and the mother smoked outside the home; she had not recently traveled or had contact with ill persons. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/68 mm Hg, the pulse 135 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx was clear, without erythema or focal lesions. The neck was supple, and the tracheostomy site was clean and dry, with an underlying small cavity. Lymphadenopathy (with nodes measuring up to 1 cm in diameter) in the right anterior cervical chain and a mildly tender right axillary lymph node (approximately 1 cm in diameter) were present. There were decreased breath sounds at the base of the right lung. There was a bulging area (4 cm by 7 cm) on the right lateral chest wall, which was tender on palpation and had no fluctuance or overlying skin changes. The hematocrit, red-cell indexes, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, magnesium, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, and lactic dehydrogenase and results of renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. A frontal chest radiograph that had been obtained 7 months before this admission showed a tracheostomy tube, clear lungs, and no pleural effusion. Frontal, lateral, and bilateral decubitus chest radiographs that were obtained on the day of admission (Figure 1) showed dense air-space opacification in the right lower lung zone, obscuring the right hemidiaphragm and right cardiac border, as well as a large pleural effusion on the right side that tracked along the lateral chest wall, with evidence of loculation. The left lung and pleural space were clear. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed on the same day after the administration of contrast material (Figure 2), revealed asymmetry of the chest wall that was due to multiple heterogeneous soft-tissue masses and thickening of the soft tissue of the right chest wall. Consolidation was present in the right lower lobe and portions of the right middle lobe. Areas of low attenuation in the right lower lobe were suggestive of decreased perfusion and possible necrosis. A large loculated pleural effusion, irregularly shaped parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe, prominent enhancing ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, and subtle periosteal elevation of the medial aspect of the right eighth rib were also present. Chest Radiographs.Radiographs of the chest were obtained on admission. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) show air-space opacification in the right lower lung zone (asterisks) and a large right pleural effusion (arrows). Decubitus chest radiographs (Panel C [right side down] and Panel D [left side down]) show that pleural fluid on the right side is not freely layering (arrows). CT Scans of the Chest.CT scans of the chest were obtained on admission, after the intravenous administration of contrast material. Panel A shows asymmetry of the chest wall, thickening of the soft tissue of the right chest wall (arrowheads), and multiple heterogeneous soft-tissue masses (arrows). Panels B and C show irregularly shaped parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe (arrows). Panel D shows consolidation in the right lower lobe (arrow) and portions of the right middle lobe, areas of low attenuation in the right lower lobe that suggest decreased perfusion and possible necrosis (arrowheads), and a large loculated pleural effusion (asterisks). Panel E also shows the large loculated pleural effusion (asterisks), as well as a prominent enhancing axillary lymph node (arrow). Panel F shows subtle periosteal elevation of the medial aspect of the right eighth rib (arrow). The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. The temperature rose to 38.7\u00b0C, and acetaminophen was administered, with improvement.

On examination by a colorectal surgeon, palpation of the levator ani muscle replicated the pain. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids. Diagnoses of levator ani muscle spasm and irritable bowel syndrome were made. Five months before presentation, intermittent nausea and eructation developed; rectal pain and constipation persisted, with occasional blood in the stool after straining. Four months later, repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed no new findings. Nausea (with coughing up or vomiting a small amount of blood), anorexia, epigastric and left upper quadrant pain, increased bloating, and gas developed, with one episode of diarrhea. The patient went to the emergency department at another hospital, where computed tomography (CT) reportedly revealed a possible fullness in the body and tail of the pancreas (i.e., the distal pancreas). During the next week, constipation alternated with diarrhea, without melena or hematochezia. Nausea was most severe 20 minutes after eating; she took antacids and famotidine, without improvement. Two days before this evaluation, anorexia developed, and she stopped eating. Her husband brought her to the emergency department at this hospital. The patient reported pain in the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, midback, and left lower flank, as well as a 4.5-kg weight loss during the previous 3 weeks, decreased energy and concentration, and three episodes of small-volume hematemesis. She reported disruptive thoughts, including that she had cancer of the pancreas, stomach, or another organ and would die young; she spent most daytime hours on the Internet researching her symptoms and writing about her condition and had difficulty caring for her children. Her sleep was normal. She reported no suicidal or homicidal ideation, although her husband reported that she had said that if this was pancreatic cancer \u201cI am going to kill myself.\u201d Two years before this evaluation, postpartum mastitis had developed in the patient, along with anxiety that she had inflammatory breast cancer. She sought treatment from two primary care physicians (PCPs) and multiple specialists, despite advice not to do so. Laboratory-test results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, mammography, and breast ultrasonography were reportedly negative. She was admitted to a 2-week day-treatment program at a psychiatric hospital. Sertraline (up to 200 mg daily), clonazepam, gabapentin, and ibuprofen were administered, with partial improvement. After discharge, she reported that she was concerned about metastatic melanoma and multiple myeloma, and she consulted specialists; examination of skin-biopsy specimens and skeletal radiographs were negative. She continued outpatient counseling and behavioral therapy, and sertraline was tapered because her anxiety diminished and she had concerns about weight gain. She had a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for which she had taken bupropion and a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine in the past; she also had a history of uterine fibroids. Medications included sertraline (75 mg daily) and clonazepam (0.5 mg twice daily). She had no known allergies. She was married, lived with her husband and two young children, and had recently moved to another state for her husband's employment. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of depression with suicide attempts; her father had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and lung and colon cancer; her paternal grandmother had colon cancer; her maternal grandmother had leukemia; and her sister and children were healthy. On examination, the vital signs were normal; the weight was 62.4 kg (10 kg less than 1 month earlier). The abdomen was soft, with epigastric and left upper quadrant tenderness, without rebound. She appeared anxious and sad and was intermittently tearful, with frequent hand-wringing and restating of a belief that she had cancer. The remainder of the examination was normal. Routine laboratory studies were normal. Urinalysis revealed 3+ ketones, 1+ blood, and a few squamous cells and bacteria per high-power field. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin and for blood in the stool was negative. On review, the CT of the abdomen performed at the other hospital was interpreted as normal.

After the braces were removed, difficulty eating and chewing reportedly worsened. Eight weeks before this evaluation, he was referred to the outpatient Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery department at this hospital. On examination, the patient had frontal bossing, downward-slanted lateral canthi, symmetric hypoplasia of the midface and maxilla, and relative mandibular hyperplasia (i.e., hyperplasia of the mandible relative to the size of the maxilla and midface) (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a negative overjet of more than 10 mm (i.e., the mandibular teeth extended more than 10 mm horizontally beyond the maxillary teeth), and the lower teeth were retroclined. The ears were in a normal position, but they protruded outward. He was referred to the medical genetics clinic for evaluation of a possible genetic cause of these and other skeletal abnormalities. Clinical Images.A photograph (Panel A) shows mild frontal bossing, downward-slanted lateral canthi, low-set and protruding ears, and severe midface hypoplasia and maxillary retrognathia. A lateral cephalogram (Panel B) shows frontal bossing, severe midface retrognathia, negative overjet (with the lower teeth extending more than 10 mm horizontally beyond the upper teeth), and impacted 12-year molars. Findings were similar in both eyes. A second photograph shows the right eye before pharmacologic dilation (Panel C). The anterior chamber was determined to be shallow, because the vertical light beams on the iris (blue arrow) and cornea (pink arrow) were very close to each other. When the border of the right pupil (Panel D, white arrow) was enlarged by pharmacologic dilation, the entire lens perimeter (orange arrow) was seen, suggesting microspherophakia. There is a mixed chest-wall defect (Panel E) with a midsternal, funnel-shaped pectus excavatum defect and lower sternal protrusion with accompanying protrusion of parasternal cartilages (Panel F, red arrow). The patient was born at full term by vaginal delivery; his birth weight was 4.3 kg. A pectus excavatum was present at birth. His height was at the 80th percentile until he was 15 years of age, after which it plateaued at the 55th percentile. No developmental delays were noted during childhood. An intermittent systolic heart murmur, which was graded 3 out of 6 (with 1 indicating a soft murmur and 6 indicating a loud murmur) had first been noted when the patient was 13 years of age. Evaluations by three cardiologists during the next 4 years revealed no cardiovascular symptoms or decreased capacity; electrocardiograms showed an indeterminate axis, and echocardiographic studies reportedly revealed a normal aortic-root size and no evidence of anomalous vasculature, atrial septal defect, valvular structural abnormalities, or findings suggestive of Marfan\u2019s syndrome. The murmur was thought to be turbulence related to the position of the heart in relation to the pectus deformity. On cardiogenetic examination performed at another hospital when the patient was 16 years of age, his weight was 69.2 kg, the height 177.8 cm, the arm span 188 cm, the ratio of arm span to height 1.06, and the ratio of upper to lower body segment 0.87. Pectus excavatum of the upper chest and pectus carinatum of the lower chest were seen, as were broad thumbs, with no evidence of joint hypermobility. Although there was insufficient evidence to diagnose Marfan\u2019s syndrome, a connective tissue abnormality was suspected. He was referred to a medical geneticist, but his family acknowledged that they were focused on the craniofacial evaluation. When the patient was 13 years of age, a diagnosis of myopia was made, and eyeglasses were prescribed by his optometrist. Over the course of the next 4 years, examinations performed at the optometrist\u2019s office showed an increase of 12.75 diopters of myopia in the right eye and an increase of 11.00 diopters in the left eye. Nine months before this evaluation, his manifest refraction was reportedly \u221213.75 diopters in the right eye and \u221210.00 diopters in the left eye. Eight months before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the ophthalmology clinic at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. On examination, his right eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of \u221214.50 diopters and his left eye refracted to a spherical equivalent of \u221211.00 diopters. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes when the patient was wearing eyeglasses. The anterior chambers were shallow (Figure 1C), and the angles were open on gonioscopy. The lenses were rounder and smaller than normal, and the lens perimeters and zonules were clearly visible in both eyes after dilation (Figure 1D). The findings on ultrasound biomicroscopy were consistent with microspherophakia (small, spherically shaped lenses) (Fig. S1 in theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org), with lens diameters of 8.41 mm in the right eye and 8.03 mm in the left eye (normal diameter, >9 mm). Lens thickness values were 4.97 mm in each eye. Axial lengths were 24.15 mm in the right eye and 23.91 mm in the left eye. Ultrasonography confirmed shallow anterior chambers, with anterior chamber depths of 2.20 mm in the right eye and 2.82 mm in the left eye (normal depth, >3.00 mm). The patient had had no serious childhood illnesses. He had bilateral epididymal cysts that had been stable for many years, had undergone repair of urethral meatal stenosis, had had an impacted fracture of the wrist owing to a sports-related injury when he was 12 years of age, and had transient musculoskeletal back pain. He was not taking any medications. He had received all routine childhood immunizations and was allergic to melons. He lived with his parents and brother, and he did well in school. He had never used tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s brother, who was 3 years older than the patient, had a deep asymmetric pectus excavatum and a history of sports-related injuries, including several ankle injuries and recurrent avulsion of a hip joint associated with kicking. He did not wear eyeglasses and had no unusual facial features except for a mild underbite. The patient\u2019s mother was of Irish and Italian ancestry, and his father was of Italian, Portuguese, Irish, and Scottish ancestry; there was no known consanguinity. His father and multiple paternal relatives had hypertension; his paternal grandfather had coronary artery disease, his grandmother had an endocrine brain tumor, his aunt had Crohn\u2019s disease, and an uncle had arthritis. His mother was healthy, his maternal grandmother had non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and a cousin had celiac disease. His mother, maternal grandmother, and aunt were 165 cm tall; his brother and maternal grandfather were 170 cm tall; and his father was 175 cm tall. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal. The weight was 66.3 kg (48th percentile), the height 177.5 cm (58th percentile), and the head circumference 58.5 cm (98th percentile). There was slight frontal bossing. The conjunctivae were clear, and the sclerae were white, without blue or gray hue. There was a mixed chest-wall defect, with funnel-shaped pectus excavatum and lower sternal protrusion with protrusion of parasternal cartilages (Figure 1E and 1F). A harsh, grade 3 systolic murmur was heard at the upper sternal border, without systolic click or diastolic murmur. There was loss of the normal upper curvature of the spine, as well as scoliosis, with the scapula and rib cage on the right side higher than the left. The remainder of the examination was normal or unchanged from recent previous examinations. The patient had above-average intelligence and was reserved. He asked thoughtful questions and consented to the proposed evaluations. Radiographs of the skeleton, including hands and feet, showed straightening of the normal cervical lordosis, rotatory S-shaped dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis, and generalized osteoporosis, with biconcavity of the end plates of multiple vertebral bodies, also known as \u201cfish\u201d or \u201ccodfish\u201d vertebrae (Figure 2A).1,2 Imaging Studies.Lateral view of the lumbar spine (Panel A) reveals concave superior and inferior end-plate depressions (identified by the arrows at L2) at multiple lumbar levels, giving rise to the appearance of \u201ccodfish\u201d vertebrae. As measured with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine (Panel B), the total bone mineral density of the spine averaged over L1 through L4 was 0.75 g per square centimeter (indicated in the graph by the circle with a cross). This value was 2.7 SD below the expected normal value for the patient\u2019s age, corresponding to a z score of \u22122.7. The graph displays the age-related normal values with 95% confidence intervals. The gray area represents the median to the 95th percentile, and the black area represents the median to the 5th percentile. The intersection of the gray and black areas is the median. A z-score value lower than \u22122.0 indicates osteoporosis, and a value between \u22122.0 and 0 indicates osteopenia. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (Figure 2B) revealed an abnormally low bone mineral density of 0.75 g per square centimeter averaged over vertebral bodies L1 through L4; when compared with age-matched controls, this value resulted in a z score of \u22122.7, which is indicative of osteoporosis.", "true_dx": "Homocystinuria caused by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase deficiency.", "pred_dx": "Marfan Syndrome", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "## Thinking", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's see what we've got here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We have a 17-year-old guy who's dealing with some pretty significant issues.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's got high myopia, which means really bad nearsightedness, and he's had trouble with speech since he was a kid.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's already setting off some alarms for something genetic or developmental.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, looking at his face, he has some distinctive features like frontal bossing, downward-slanting eyes, and a weird jaw alignment.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "These are classic signs of certain syndromes.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And then there's the chest - he's got a pectus excavatum, where part of his chest caves inward.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's interesting because it's not just about looks; it could point us toward specific conditions.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His eyes are another big clue.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They're shallow, and the lenses are small and round, which is called microspherophakia.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This isn't typical and makes me think of disorders that affect the connective tissues.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, his vision has gotten worse quickly over the past few years, which suggests something progressive.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's also got some skeletal issues.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His bones aren't dense enough, especially in his spine, which is called osteoporosis.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And those vertebrae look like 'codfish' due to how they're shaped.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This kind of thing often happens in certain genetic conditions.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's consider the family history.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His dad and grandpa have hypertension, and there's a bunch of other health problems on his mom's side too.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But nothing jumps out as directly related to him, except maybe the height.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Both parents are taller than average, but his brother is even taller, so that might not be it.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, putting all this together, we've got high myopia, unique facial features, chest deformities, eye changes, skeletal issues, and a family history of various health problems.", "t": 5, "c": "2", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, this sounds a lot like Marfan syndrome at first glance, but wait, there's no mention of long limbs or arachnodactyly, which are common in Marfan's.", "t": 5, "c": "14", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, the bone issues don't fit perfectly either.", "t": 5, "c": "14", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's think about other possibilities.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 25, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Could it be homocystinuria?

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when cough and headache developed. One day before admission, vomiting and diarrhea developed. That day, the patient was last seen by her husband at 3:00 p.m. before she went to sleep. The husband reported that the patient awoke screaming at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission, and emergency medical services (EMS) were called. When EMS personnel arrived, the patient was reportedly lethargic and unable to answer questions. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intravenous dextrose was administered. A repeat fingerstick glucose measurement was 127 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter), and the lethargy abated. The patient was brought by EMS personnel to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported weakness on the left side of her body and persistent headache. She reported that when she had awoken at 1:00 a.m., she was unable to move or speak, was afraid she was going to die, and began screaming for help. She reported no aura, urinary or fecal incontinence, or neck pain. She had recently moved from Puerto Rico and lived in a suburb of Boston. She did not speak English and was marginally housed, sleeping in the living room of a friend\u2019s apartment with her husband. Several people living in the apartment had had cough and fever. The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and schizophrenia. Medications included aspirin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and risperidone. She had no known drug allergies. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 114/62 mm Hg, the heart rate 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.5. The patient was alert and interactive. She was oriented to person and place but not to time. The cranial-nerve examination was normal. Strength in the left arm and left leg was 4/5, and strength in the right arm and right leg was 5/5. She had difficulty manipulating small objects placed in the left hand. The left arm showed pronator drift and orbiting. Sensation to light touch was intact. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed 2 hours after presentation. Diffusion-weighted images showed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion within the posterior limb of the right internal capsule; no corresponding abnormality was observed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 1A and 1B). A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) obtained 2.5 hours after presentation showed a nodular focus in the left midlung field. Imaging Studies of the Head and Chest.MRI was performed 2 hours after presentation. A diffusion-weighted image (Panel A) shows a punctate focus of restricted diffusion within the posterior limb of the right internal capsule (arrow). No corresponding abnormality is observed on a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel B). A chest radiograph (Panel C) obtained 2.5 hours after presentation shows a nodular focus in the left midlung field (arrow). A test of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The results of urine toxicologic screening were normal. Treatment decisions were made, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

Ten days before admission, the patient went into labor at 39 weeks of gestation. A low transverse cesarean section and tubal ligation were performed electively at another hospital with the patient under spinal anesthesia, without complications. A healthy infant was delivered; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. A tuberculin skin test was negative, and a tetanus\u2013diphtheria\u2013acellular pertussis vaccine was administered to the patient. The patient returned home on the third postpartum day. She remained well until approximately 5 days before admission (5 days after the cesarean section), when gradually increasing orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion developed, associated with mild leg edema. Two days before admission, intermittent substernal chest tightness developed, associated with nausea, vomiting, and a cough productive of blood-tinged sputum but without fever or chills. The night before admission, she went to the emergency department of another hospital because of worsening dyspnea. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/74 mm Hg, the pulse 113 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The lungs were clear. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 130 beats per minute and possible left atrial enlargement, with no ST-segment elevation or depression. Blood levels of total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal, as were tests of renal function; other test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography, performed according to the pulmonary embolism protocol with the administration of iopamidol, reportedly revealed an enlarged heart; small, bilateral pleural effusions; patchy air-space disease, with areas of patchy consolidation and thickening of the interlobular septa bilaterally; and no evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, or pericardial effusion. Laboratory Data. Two hours after the patient's arrival at the other hospital, marked anxiety and increased dyspnea developed. Lorazepam was administered, followed by heparin. The blood pressure rose to 201/176 mm Hg and the pulse to 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 21 to 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation fell to 64%. Etomidate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and manual ventilation was begun. Approximately 200 ml of frothy, pink secretions were suctioned. Ten minutes later, the blood pressure fell transiently to 76/43 mg Hg; the pulse was 111 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 81%. During the next hour, succinylcholine, furosemide (40 mg), and midazolam were administered intravenously. One liter of clear urine was collected by catheter. The oxygen saturation was 90% with manual ventilation (the fraction of inspired oxygen was not recorded); desaturation to 56 to 80% occurred when the patient was mechanically ventilated. Approximately 3.5 hours after arrival, she was transferred by ambulance to this hospital for admission. During transfer, she was manually ventilated; the blood pressure was 88/61 mm Hg, and the pulse was 136 beats per minute, weak, and regular. Seven years earlier, the patient's first child was delivered at 40 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of failure to progress and fetal distress. The patient had had two spontaneous abortions, 16 months and 13 months before this admission. She had a history of Graves' disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, anemia, and urinary tract infections. Medications before admission included ibuprofen, docusate, and methimazole, and she had taken micronized progesterone and propylthiouracil during the first trimester. She had no known allergies. She was born in South America and had moved to the United States 5 years earlier. She lived with her husband and children and worked as a housecleaner. She did not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died at 60 years of age from myocardial infarction, her maternal grandmother had died of a stroke, her father and maternal grandmother had had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, as did her mother, and her sister had nephrolithiasis and asthma. On examination, the patient was sedated and intubated. She was breathing spontaneously and showed movement when examined. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/87 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing 100% oxygen. The skin was diaphoretic. Jugular venous distention could not be assessed. There were crackles at both lung bases, without wheezing. The heart sounds were rapid and regular. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, the surgical incision appeared clean, and the extremities were cool. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, amylase, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of tests of coagulation and renal function; testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 1+ occult blood and trace albumin, with mucin in the sediment, and was otherwise normal; testing for urinary legionella antigen and human chorionic gonadotropic hormone was negative. A chest radiograph (Figure 1) shows an endotracheal tube with its distal end 2 cm above the carina. The heart is enlarged, and there is haziness over both costophrenic angles, indicating small bilateral pleural effusions. There are patchy opacities in the middle and lower lung zones, more in the right lung than in the left lung, findings that are most consistent with pulmonary edema. Chest Radiograph on Admission.An anteroposterior chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube with its distal end 2 cm from the carina. The heart is enlarged, and there is haziness over both costophrenic angles, indicating small bilateral pleural effusions. There are patchy opacities in the middle and lower lung zones, more in the right lung than in the left lung, findings that are most consistent with pulmonary edema. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. In the emergency department, a catheter was inserted into the radial artery. Furosemide (a 40-mg bolus), midazolam, and fentanyl were administered intravenously. Approximately 2 hours after arrival, the blood pressure decreased to 61/35 mm Hg, and norepinephrine bitartrate was infused, with improvement to 81/61 mm Hg.

The patient had been well until 8 days before admission, when she noted a pimplelike lesion on the left side of her forehead, near the hairline. She squeezed a scant amount of clear fluid from the lesion. Over the next 3 days, the lesion increased in size. Five days before admission, the patient awoke with a temperature of 39.4\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, and malaise. She went to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. Blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home and was advised to rest and take acetaminophen. Laboratory Data. Temperatures as high as 40.0\u00b0C, chills, and myalgias persisted. The patient felt weak, had a reduced appetite, and noted tender swelling of the left side of her neck. The lesion on the forehead continued to enlarge, took on the appearance of a blister containing dark fluid, and then ulcerated; redness and swelling surrounding the lesion developed. Two days before admission, the patient returned to the other hospital. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin. A urinalysis showed trace glucose, 1+ ketones, 2+ occult blood, and 3+ protein by dipstick, as well as a specific gravity of 1.025 and a pH of 6.5; there were 25 to 50 red cells and 2 to 5 white cells per high-power field. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture. A chest radiograph was normal, and additional imaging studies were performed. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck revealed substantial asymmetric lymphadenopathy involving the head, face, and neck on the left side (Figure 1A). Enlarged lymph nodes were identified in the left postauricular region, in the left submandibular region, along the left anterior and posterior cervical chains, and in the supraclavicular region. Inferior to the angle of the left mandible, a pair of nodes was identified that displaced the left submandibular gland (Figure 1B). These nodes were hypodense centrally, and there was substantial infiltration of the surrounding fat. Many of the nodes had contrast enhancement. These findings suggested an inflammatory process. A 4-mm hypodense lesion was also seen in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. CT Scans of the Head and Neck.Contrast-enhanced CT scans of the head and neck show substantial asymmetric lymphadenopathy. A coronal image of the neck shows enlarged lymph nodes underneath the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (Panel A, arrows). An axial image, obtained inferior to the angle of the jaw, shows a pair of centrally hypodense nodes that displaces the left submandibular gland (Panel B); substantial infiltration of the surrounding fat is visible (arrow). Intravenous clindamycin was administered. The patient was discharged home with a prescription for oral clindamycin. One day before admission, the patient was seen for a follow-up appointment at the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. She reported that she continued to feel unwell and that the lesion on her forehead had further enlarged and was painful. Continued administration of oral clindamycin was recommended; the patient was advised to apply hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic ointment to the lesion and to return to the emergency department if her fevers did not abate. The next day, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital and reported a temperature of 39.4\u00b0C and persistent myalgias and malaise. Standing and walking had become difficult because of fatigue and weakness. On examination, the patient was alert and in no acute distress, and the vital signs were within normal limits. There was an ulcerated lesion (measuring 4 cm by 2 cm) on the forehead, with a central eschar and surrounding edema, as well as marked swelling of the left side of the neck. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of lactic acid, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Specimens of blood were sent for culture. A chest radiograph was normal. Additional antibiotics were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to this hospital by ambulance. On admission, the patient reported a mild frontal headache. She had a remote history of a cesarean section. Her only medications were acetaminophen and clindamycin, and she had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and dog and was a homemaker. During the 2 months before the onset of illness, she had been living in a wooded area of coastal New England; she took frequent walks to ponds and to the beach, kayaked, and had seen deer, skunks, and rabbits. Several months before the onset of illness, she had taken a hiking trip in southern California. The patient was monogamous with her husband, consumed alcohol in moderation, did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and had no exposure to sick persons. A sister had systemic lupus erythematosus, and other family members had hypertension, cataracts, and glaucoma. On examination, the patient was in no acute distress. The temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There was an ulcer (measuring 4 cm by 2 cm) at the hairline, just to the left of the midline; the center of the ulcer was white, the borders were black and slightly raised, and the skin around the lesion was mildly erythematous, edematous, and tender (Figure 2A). Left cervical lymphadenopathy with firm, tender, mobile nodes was present; the largest lymph nodes were a submandibular lymph node that was 3 cm in diameter, anterior cervical lymph nodes that were 2 cm and 1 cm in diameter, and a posterior auricular lymph node that was 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2B). A systolic murmur (grade 2/6) was heard at the right upper sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, results of renal-function tests, and blood levels of calcium and magnesium were normal. Urinalysis showed 1+ glucose, 1+ occult blood, and 2+ albumin by dipstick, as well as a specific gravity of 1.017 and a pH of 6.0; on microscopic examination, 1+ renal tubular cells and mucin were seen. The results of other laboratory tests are shown inTable 1. Specimens of blood and urine were sent for culture. Normal saline and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered intravenously.

Fifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of \u201cspitting up\u201d; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the current admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard-yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and thed-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated. He was discharged home with a prescription for a course of metronidazole.

During the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weakness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held. The patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had undergone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was characterized by purplish and pinkish plaques that appeared and varied in intensity of color throughout the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment. Immunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcellulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his mother, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syndrome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypothyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grandfather had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal family members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Figure 1). Clinical Photographs.The patient has well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques involving the back, abdomen, arms, and legs (Panels A and B). The evanescent rash is nonpruritic and nontender; it does not affect the palms or soles. The ferritin andd-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the platelet count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinalysis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint fluid in the hips and knees (Figure 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries. Imaging Studies.Coronal and axial CT images (Panels A and B, respectively) of the abdomen and pelvis show multiple enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes (arrows) and an enlarged iliac lymph node (arrowhead). The liver and spleen have a normal appearance. There is no evidence of cholecystitis, although a single gallstone was detected (not shown). There is no evidence of cancer. A sagittal ultrasound image (Panel C) shows joint fluid in the right knee (arrow); small effusions involving both knees and hips were detected (not shown).

The patient was reportedly well until unintentional weight loss occurred approximately 6 weeks before presentation. Three weeks before presentation, upper abdominal pain developed that the patient rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain radiated to his throat, increased after eating and drinking, and did not diminish with ibuprofen. At the outpatient clinic, the patient reported nausea, occasional vomiting, decreased food intake, and a loss of 10 kg from his usual weight of 64.4 kg. He reported no headaches, visual changes, neck stiffness, dyspnea, substernal chest pain, lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, dysuria, rashes, or joint pain. He had had a respiratory illness approximately 2 years before this evaluation. He had no known allergies. He was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 4 years. He worked in agriculture and did not speak English. He smoked cigars occasionally, drank alcohol infrequently, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared cachectic. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 101/68 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or distention. There was macular hyperpigmentation of the feet and legs that reportedly had not changed for 10 years. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis revealed 1+ protein and was otherwise normal. Ranitidine was prescribed, and the patient returned home with instructions to follow up the next day when test results were available. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. A frontal chest radiograph showed subtle, tiny nodules throughout both lungs, without focal consolidation (Figure 1A). There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Images of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.A frontal chest radiograph shows multiple tiny nodules throughout both lungs (Panel A, arrows). An axial image from a CT scan of the chest shows numerous nodules, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, randomly distributed in a miliary pattern in both lungs (Panel B). Magnification of the same axial image shows the miliary nodules (Panel C, arrows). A contrast-enhanced, coronal reformation of a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with low-attenuation centers (Panel D, arrows). Two days later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported persistent abdominal pain that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, as well as sore throat, fever, and one episode of hematemesis that had occurred the day before. He reported no cough, congestion, or improvement with ranitidine. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/65 mm Hg, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. There were coarse breath sounds at both lung bases. The abdomen was firm, without distention, masses, guarding, or rebound; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Airborne precautions were instituted, and a face mask was placed. Acetaminophen was administered, and a tuberculin skin test was performed. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. He was heterosexual and reported having no more than eight partners in his lifetime and consistently using condoms. There was no known history of exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the temperature was 35.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/65 mm Hg, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 47.6 kg, the height 160 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.6. A white exudate was present on the underside of the tongue. A nontender, mobile lymph node, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, was present in the left submandibular chain, and additional nontender, mobile lymph nodes were present in the right submental region and the right cervical region. Fine rales were scattered throughout both lungs, and the abdomen was soft; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, and amylase were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and renal function; other test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material revealed numerous nodules, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, randomly distributed in a miliary pattern (i.e., having an appearance that is similar to millet seeds [Figure 2]) in both lungs, without mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy (Figure 1B and 1C). To help evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained that showed multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and new, small bilateral pleural effusions. The mesenteric lymph nodes had low-attenuation centers that were suggestive of central necrosis (Figure 1D). There was no evidence of bowel dilatation or bowel-wall thickening. Millet Seeds. Specimens of blood, sputum, and urine were obtained. Intravenous saline and one dose of ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered, followed by fluconazole, omeprazole, and nystatin suspension. Results of coagulation tests were normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first day, the temperature rose to 39.7\u00b0C. Acetaminophen was administered.

Approximately 1 year before presentation, the patient had had transient tightness in the chest and shoulder on the left side that had prompted a referral to outpatient physical therapy. Five days before presentation, while the patient was packing for a flight to Boston, acute substernal chest pain developed; the pain radiated to the jaw and shoulders and was accompanied by dyspnea and by a feeling of needing to belch. These symptoms lasted 1 hour and then spontaneously resolved, and she attributed them to fatigue. On the day before presentation, substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw and shoulders recurred after the patient had been walking, and the pain gradually resolved after a few hours. Before dinner on the evening of presentation, the pain recurred and was associated with light-headedness. The patient attended dinner but had persistent pain, along with dyspnea. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital. On physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/87 mm Hg in both arms, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She did not have carotid bruits or jugular venous distention, nor did she have cardiac murmur, rub, or gallop on auscultation. Her digits were hyperextensible. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. The patient had no history of dysrhythmia, heart-failure symptoms, trauma, or constitutional, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic symptoms. She had undergone a laparoscopy for an ovarian cyst, and she had had a miscarriage 1 month before this evaluation. She took no medications. Penicillin and sulfa drugs caused urticaria. She exercised four times weekly with an elliptical machine and walked her dog daily. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; she consumed two alcoholic beverages per week. She had a healthy 11-year-old daughter. Her father had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and an embolic stroke. Her mother, brother, and sister had hypermobile Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome: her mother had joint hypermobility and had received the diagnosis during her first pregnancy because of recurrent hip subluxations; her brother had joint hypermobility and spontaneous pneumothorax and bruised easily; and her sister had joint hypermobility and bruised easily. A maternal second cousin had died at 51 years of age from a cerebral aneurysm. Electrocardiography and cardiac imaging studies were performed. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm and submillimeter downsloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5(Figure 1). The depressions had decreased in magnitude on electrocardiography performed 3 hours later and had fully resolved on electrocardiography performed 8 hours after presentation. Electrocardiogram.An electrocardiogram, which was obtained on presentation, shows a normal sinus rhythm and submillimeter downsloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5. Transthoracic echocardiography showed overall normal left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function. There was a small, focal area of hypokinesis in the left ventricular inferolateral wall (seeVideo 1andVideo 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was no clinically significant valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or pericardial effusion. Although there was increased mobility of the interatrial septum, a color Doppler study showed no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiography showed no abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material with the use of a standard aortic-dissection protocol. There was no evidence of aortic dissection or proximal pulmonary embolism. The aorta appeared normal, with a preserved sinotubular junction, and the ascending aorta and descending aorta each had a normal diameter.

Labor was induced because of maternal hypertension. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. On examination, microcephaly was noted; there were no dysmorphic features. The weight was 2.9 kg (13th percentile), the length 50.8 cm (60th percentile), and the head circumference 29.5 cm (<1st percentile) (Fig. 1 in theSupplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Results of the Massachusetts Newborn Screening Panel, which can identify more than 60 disorders, were normal. On the patient's 18th day of life, radiographs of the head showed no abnormalities other than a small calvarium. Testing for toxoplasma and rubella was positive for IgG antibodies and negative for IgM antibodies; testing for cytomegalovirus was negative. At 3 weeks of age, he was evaluated by the genetics service at a second hospital because of microcephaly. His parents reported that he rolled his eyes when upset and had labored breathing after feeding but was otherwise well. On examination, there was microcephaly, the coronal ridges were palpable, and there were no other abnormalities. Array-comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed 16p11.2 duplication, which was thought to be benign. His infant formula was changed, and symptoms associated with feedings improved. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was performed when the infant was 6.5 weeks of age reportedly revealed a small brain, delayed myelination, and partial agenesis of the posterior corpus callosum. At 5 months of age, the patient was unable to roll over, constipation had developed, and his mother noted poor visual tracking. One month later, neurologic examination revealed pupils that were equal in size and reactive to light, decreased visual fixation, and failure to track. There was decreased truncal control, axial hypotonia, and near-normal tone in the arms and legs, which the patient could move normally. Muscle bulk and deep-tendon reflexes were normal; plantar reflexes were flexor. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination did not reveal optic-nerve hypoplasia. A diagnosis of cortical blindness was made. Genetic testing for the primary microcephaly syndromes was suggested. Twenty days before the current admission, episodes of head bobbing and perioral cyanosis occurred during feedings. Three days later, the patient was admitted to the second hospital, where he reportedly had episodes of respiratory distress with agitation or repositioning. On examination during an episode, he had near-agonal breathing with costal retractions and without tachypnea, an oxygen saturation between 80% and 89%, head bobbing, grunting, back arching, limb extension, increased muscle tone, cool and mottled arms and legs, perioral cyanosis, and a decreased heart rate (of approximately 75 beats per minute). The episodes occurred several times daily, resolved with oxygen administration, and when protracted, were followed by long naps. Growth measurements are shown in Fig. 1 in theSupplementary Appendix, and laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed hypodensities in frontal and parietal white matter, mild prominence of the ventricles, and extra-axial spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid (possibly normal features for a patient of this age), with no acute hemorrhage, mass, or midline shift. Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux revealed reflux below the level of the clavicles, without aspiration; an examination with a pH probe revealed no evidence of reflux during the episodes of cyanosis. An electroencephalogram showed slowing of the background rhythm, without evidence of seizure activity during an episode. Famotidine and lactulose were administered, and a nasojejunal feeding tube was placed. Laboratory Data. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day but was readmitted 2 days later because of recurrent episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Chest radiographs reportedly showed mild bronchial-wall thickening and low lung volumes. Testing for respiratory viruses was negative. Evaluation of the respiratory and upper gastrointestinal tracts reportedly revealed small diaphragmatic excursions, mild esophagitis, and reflux below the level of the carina, with slow clearing. The transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. On the 10th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Medications on transfer included lactulose and lansoprazole. The parents reported that the patient was unable to roll over or sit up without assistance. He received infant formula orally. Immunizations were current, including one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and older sibling and received early-intervention services. His parents were white, with no known history of consanguinity. His mother had had two spontaneous miscarriages; his parents and sibling were healthy, and the maternal and paternal head circumferences were normal. His maternal grandmother had a bifid uvula, but the three-generation family history was otherwise unremarkable. On examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/55 mm Hg, the pulse 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute (with deep subcostal retractions), and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing oxygen at a rate of 1 liter per minute through a nasal cannula. The lungs were clear. On neurologic examination, the eyes were open when the patient was awake, with no tracking to visual stimuli, but the eyes closed in response to bright light and blinked in response to threat. The pupils contracted from 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally, and a red reflex was seen. The face was symmetric, without facial diplegia. When the patient was in the supine position, the legs were abducted, the arms extended, and the hands fisted. There were spontaneous, symmetric, and antigravity limb movements. Head control and truncal tone were poor; he was unable to sit up without support and leaned toward the left. Patellar reflexes were brisk (3+), and there was sustained clonus at the left ankle and 5 beats of clonus at the right ankle; plantar grasp reflexes were present bilaterally. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, triglycerides, thyrotropin, copper, and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were normal, as were the anion gap and results of liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Lansoprazole, lactulose, lorazepam (as needed for agitation), and glycerin suppositories were administered. On the first hospital day, the patient had two episodes of respiratory distress and cyanosis that were similar to previously reported episodes. The temperature was 35.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/50 mm Hg, the pulse 75 to 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing oxygen at a rate of 3 liters per minute through a nasal cannula. Venous blood gas measurements are shown inTable 1. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered by face mask, with improvement. On the second day, apnea and cyanosis occurred intermittently. Otolaryngologic examination revealed incomplete vocal-cord adduction. Bronchoscopy revealed mild main-stem and lower-lobe bronchomalacia on the left side. A central venous catheter was placed in the right saphenous vein. Gabapentin was begun. Blood and urine amino acid profiles were reported to be normal (selected values are shown inTable 1). MRI that was performed the next day, without the administration of contrast material, revealed pontomedullary hypoplasia, a diminutive corpus callosum, and a myelin disorder most consistent with hypomyelination. A sagittal T1-weighted image shows a diminutive pons and medulla, which can be best visualized when compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain (Figure 1). Although the diminutive brain stem may be in part explained by white-matter depletion, the findings raise concern for a component of malformation. The corpus callosum is diminutive; the anterior genu and body have formed but are abnormally thin, and the splenium appears deficient as it merges posteriorly with the hippocampal commissure and fornices. MRI Scans Obtained on Admission.A sagittal T1-weighted image (Panel A) shows hypoplasia of the pons (white arrow) and medulla (black arrow) and a diminutive corpus callosum (arrowhead), as compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain (Panel B). An axial T2-weighted image (Panel C) shows a decrease in white-matter volume and hyperintense signal abnormality in the bilateral deep white matter (asterisks), as compared with an image of an age-matched normal brain (Panel D); these findings are suggestive of hypomyelination. The white-matter volume appears reduced as compared with an MRI scan from an age-matched developmentally normal child (Figure 1). By 11 months of age, normal myelination usually results in low signal in parts of the supratentorial white matter on T2-weighted imaging, but on this patient's T2-weighted images, there was hyperintense signal abnormality (Figure 1), which suggests an underlying delay in myelination or a genetic myelin disorder. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed no abnormalities. On the ninth day, the patient's work of breathing increased, and there was associated bradycardia. Swelling at the site of the central catheter was noted. The catheter was removed and cultured, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were administered. Test results are shown inTable 1. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun. Cultures of the blood, urine, and catheter tip were negative, as were tests for respiratory viruses. Ultrasonography revealed thrombosis of the right common femoral vein.

The patient had been well on the day of admission until, while lifting heavy boxes with a friend, he suddenly felt \u201ca warm feeling\u201d diffusely and had discomfort in his epigastrium and right upper quadrant that radiated throughout his abdomen, followed by tingling in his mouth, tongue, arms, and legs. Within the next few minutes, his vision blurred and darkened. He felt faint and lay down on the sidewalk. Within 5 minutes after the onset of symptoms, nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred, and he lost consciousness. His friend held him in a sitting position and noticed he was shaking. Emergency medical services were called. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the patient was lying on the sidewalk, unresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli, and had diaphoresis, shallow breathing, a clenched jaw, and urinary incontinence. A nasopharyngeal airway was placed, high-flow oxygen was administered, and ventilation with a bag-valve mask was performed at a rate of 10 breaths per minute. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness). The blood pressure was 53/27 mm Hg, and the pulse 90 beats per minute. A cardiac monitor recorded normal sinus rhythm. A bolus of normal saline was rapidly infused. Within 3 minutes, the pulse rose to 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure rose to 60/28 mm Hg, and spontaneous respirations resumed; high-flow oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. The level of capillary blood glucose was 73 mg per deciliter (4.05 mmol per liter). Naloxone was administered intravenously, without improvement. During transport to this hospital by ambulance, the patient opened his eyes in response to verbal stimuli. The blood pressure transiently rose to 102/73 mm Hg and then fell to 83/31 mm Hg, the pulse was 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate was 17 to 21 breaths per minute, and the Glasgow Coma Scale score rose to 9. On arrival in the emergency department, approximately 30 minutes after the onset of symptoms, the patient was initially difficult to arouse, but his condition rapidly improved and then he was alert and responsive. He reported abdominal pain, which he rated at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The patient had no recollection of the events immediately leading to his presentation and had had no headache, chest pain, palpitations, or seizure activity preceding his symptoms. He reported occasional pruritus when showering. He had had an appendectomy in the past, took no medications, and had no known allergies. The patient was born in Romania and had come to the United States 6 years before presentation to attend school. He returned annually to Romania to visit family. He noted that he had been exposed to stray dogs while he was in Romania. He had also traveled to India and China 6 and 7 years earlier, respectively. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His father had had cardiovascular disease and had died of a myocardial infarction at 59 years of age; there was no family history of a seizure disorder or cancer. On examination, the patient was fully oriented. The blood pressure was 98/48 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the temperature 36.0\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute (unlabored), and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing oxygen through a face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute and 98% after he had been rapidly weaned from oxygen supplementation and was breathing ambient air. The pupils were equal in diameter, round, and reactive to light. The lungs were clear, and the heart sounds had a rapid, regular rhythm and were otherwise normal. The chest was mildly tender on percussion of the left side. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and tender on palpation of the epigastric region and of the right side of the abdomen, with voluntary guarding. The skin was diffusely flushed, with a warm, blanching rash on his neck, chest, and abdomen; his fingers and feet were cool, without edema or urticaria. The remainder of the examination was normal. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was initially 14 and rose to 15, and the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Cardiac monitoring revealed sinus tachycardia, without ectopy. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 127 beats per minute, with right atrial enlargement and a nonspecific ST-segment abnormality. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, globulin, troponin T, and lipase and results ofd-dimer and renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. An abdominal ultrasound examination, performed at the bedside, showed no free fluid in the right or left upper quadrant or in the pericardial or retrovesicular space; a hypoechoic abnormality with internal echoes was present in the liver. Laboratory Data. During the first hour after arrival, the patient became tremulous and nauseated. Normal saline and ondansetron were administered intravenously. A chest radiograph was normal, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. During the next hour, cyanosis of the lips and nail beds and swelling of the hands occurred; abdominal erythema and blanching of the fingers and feet persisted. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. During the first 4 hours in the emergency department, 2 liters of normal saline were infused. The blood pressure was 96/52 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until approximately 9 months before this evaluation, when small, slightly pruritic papules developed on her left breast, chest, and back. Eight months before this evaluation, she was seen by a dermatologist. A diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma was considered, and a biopsy of a lesion on the left breast was performed at a hospital in another state. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly revealed evidence of a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder that was thought to be consistent withALK-negative ALCL. The patient was referred to an oncologist. She reported no weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, fatigue, or shortness of breath. Combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed enlarged right common iliac, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. The largest node, an inguinal node that was 4.1 cm by 2.4 cm in greatest dimension (Figure 1A), showed increased18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity (Figure 1B). Imaging Studies.An axial CT scan obtained after the administration of contrast material at the time of the initial diagnosis (Panel A) shows an enlarged right inguinal lymph node (arrow). A positron-emission tomographic (PET) scan (Panel B) shows increased18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the lymph node (arrow). An axial CT scan obtained without the administration of contrast material 7 months after the initial diagnosis (Panel C) shows a decrease in the size of the right inguinal lymph node (arrow); the node no longer had increased FDG avidity (data not shown). An axial CT scan of the upper thighs obtained without the administration of contrast material (Panel D) shows skin thickening along the lateral right thigh (arrow). A PET scan (Panel E) shows increased FDG avidity in this region (arrow). Chemotherapy, consisting of six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, was administered. After the fourth cycle, the skin lesions had resolved. Five weeks before this evaluation, approximately 2 months after the completion of chemotherapy, new lesions appeared on the patient\u2019s back and right flank. A complete blood count was reportedly normal. Biopsies of the new lesions were performed; pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly revealed evidence of recurrent ALCL. On follow-up imaging studies, performed 3 weeks before this evaluation, the inguinal lymph nodes had decreased in size; the largest node was now 2.0 cm by 0.6 cm in greatest dimension (Figure 1C) and no longer showed increased FDG avidity. There was also skin thickening in the left lateral thigh (Figure 1D), which showed increased FDG avidity (Figure 1E). Two additional skin lesions developed on the patient\u2019s left shoulder. Topical triamcinolone was administered, with partial improvement. She came to this hospital for a second opinion. The patient reported that similar skin lesions had developed in the past and resolved without treatment after approximately 1 month. She reported weight loss of 9 kg after chemotherapy and rated her fatigue level at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe fatigue. She had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, arthritis, obesity, and a history of cutaneous squamous-cell and basal-cell carcinomas, numerous cysts, acneiform lesions, and actinic keratoses. Medications included benazepril, aspirin, pravastatin, gemfibrozil, levothyroxine sodium, diclofenac, ascorbic acid, a multivitamin, omeprazole, and n\u22123 fish oil. She had no known allergies. She was divorced, lived alone in the southeastern United States, and was employed. She had an 80-pack-year history of smoking and had stopped smoking 2 years before this evaluation; she drank two alcoholic beverages daily. Her mother had died of breast cancer, her sister had thyroid cancer, her brother had nonmelanoma skin cancer, and her son was healthy. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal.

The patient had a history of hypothyroidism and Lyme disease but was otherwise well until approximately 3 months before presentation, when progressive fatigue developed while she was traveling during the summer. Two months before presentation, she was seen by her physician at another hospital. On examination, the blood pressure was 170/80 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. The thyrotropin level was 7.9 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.34 to 4.82); testing for Lyme disease was negative, and the creatine kinase level was normal. The patient\u2019s dose of levothyroxine was increased from 50 \u03bcg to 75 \u03bcg daily. One week later, generalized unsteadiness developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the use of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or infarct and was unchanged from imaging studies obtained 1 year earlier. Approximately 1 month before the current evaluation, fatigue markedly worsened, and diffuse muscle aches developed, which were associated with pain that radiated down both legs. Nine days before this evaluation, the patient went to the emergency department at the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/69 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiration rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, total protein, and albumin; results of renal function tests were also normal. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained, and doxycycline was administered. The patient was advised that her symptoms were not consistent with Lyme disease and was instructed to see her primary care physician for further evaluation. Laboratory Data. Four days later, on examination at her physician\u2019s office, the patient reported recent night sweats that were so drenching that she had had to change her nightgown. On examination, the blood pressure was 141/69 mm Hg, and the abdomen was soft and slightly distended; the remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin were normal; additional test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent atelectatic changes in both lungs (Figure 1), a low-attenuation lesion (measuring 15 mm in diameter) that was consistent with a hepatic cyst (with no biliary-duct dilatation), splenomegaly (maximal span, 15 cm [normal span, \u226413]), a renal cyst that appeared to be benign, atherosclerotic calcifications, and osteopenia. No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis was seen. Computed Tomographic Image of the Abdomen and Pelvis.A coronal image of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows an enlarged spleen (maximal dimension, 145.7 mm) without a discrete focal lesion. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital. On evaluation, she reported feeling tired and having intermittent muscle aches and night sweats. She reported no abnormal bleeding, bruising, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, change in appetite or sleeping pattern, weight loss, rash, pruritus, or known recent tick bite. She had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, a history of babesiosis, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections; she also reported having had depression after the death of her husband. A diagnosis of Lyme disease had been made 14 months earlier, when she presented with erythema migrans and fatigue. Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for a period of 2 weeks) was administered, and the rash resolved. Two months later, body aches and night sweats developed but resolved after a brief period; testing for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiand polymerase-chain-reaction assays forBabesia microtiandAnaplasma phagocytophilumnucleic acids were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. She had had a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse, unilateral oophorectomy after an ectopic pregnancy, lumbar laminectomy, partial colectomy for diverticulosis, and bilateral total knee replacement. Daily medications and supplements included aspirin (81 mg), losartan, atorvastatin, calcium (40 mg), levothyroxine, celecoxib (200 mg), vitamin D, a multivitamin, cranberry tablets, and latanoprost ophthalmic solution, as well as lorazepam (0.5 mg, as needed) at night. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived alone in a coastal area of New England and had retired after working in education. She was physically active. She drank two alcoholic beverages each evening, had stopped smoking more than 50 years earlier after casual use, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and sister had died of lung cancer, and her mother had died when she was older than 90 years of age. Her adult children were healthy. On examination, the patient looked younger than her stated age. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/62 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiration rate 18 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.4. The tip of the spleen was felt 1 to 2 cm below the left costal margin, and there was trace edema in both ankles. There was no lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal.

Two days before this admission, the patient had had nausea and vomiting. Acetaminophen, at a dose of 650 mg up to three times daily as needed, was prescribed, in addition to a preexisting prescription for acetaminophen at a dose of 325 mg twice daily. Earlier during the day of admission, the patient was reported to be acting strangely; later, he was found in an unresponsive state on the floor of his cell. Emergency medical services personnel were called to the jail, where they found the patient in an unresponsive state, in a decerebrate posture, and incontinent of urine. The blood glucose level, obtained by finger-stick testing, was less than 10 mg per deciliter (<0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. The available medical history was limited. The patient had a history of substance-use disorder (including the use of alcohol, opiates, and cocaine), traumatic brain injuries, seizures, anemia, and a psychotic disorder for which the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia had been considered. Six years before the current presentation, tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen were negative, and a test for HBV surface antibodies was positive. The patient had been assaulted several times during the 14 months before this admission; the assaults had resulted in a subdural hematoma, orbital and nasal fractures, and jaw fractures. Eight months before the current admission, he had been admitted to this hospital for altered behavior. On evaluation, he had had an unremarkable computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, hyperammonemia that was thought to be related to alcoholism, and an echogenic liver on ultrasonography that was thought to represent a combination of fatty infiltration and fibrosis; his mental status improved with the administration of lactulose. Six weeks before the current admission, the patient had been evaluated at this hospital because of facial injuries. CT scans of the face, brain, and neck were unremarkable; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Medications included lactulose, thiamine, sertraline, oxycodone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Details of the patient\u2019s family history were unavailable. The patient had been homeless. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, had drunk several pints of vodka daily before incarceration, and had previously reported using intranasal cocaine and heroin. Laboratory Data. On examination in the emergency department, the patient was unresponsive and had grunting respirations. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 170/119 mm Hg. The skin was jaundiced and the sclerae icteric. The pupils were equal in size; the right pupil reacted to light more slowly than the left pupil. There was diffuse hypertonicity, extensor posturing of the arms, myoclonic jerking movements of the legs, and clonus. A systolic flow murmur was heard on auscultation, and the abdomen was mildly distended. Intravenous dextrose and lorazepam were administered on arrival, and endotracheal intubation was performed. A urine toxicology screen was negative. A complete serum toxicology screen revealed no detectable acetaminophen; metabolites of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam were present. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous thiamine, propofol,N-acetylcysteine, hydrocortisone, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plasma were administered. Lactulose was administered through an orogastric tube. Imaging studies were performed. A chest radiograph showed discoid atelectasis at the left lung base (Figure 1A). An abdominal ultrasound image showed a thick, hypoechoic gallbladder wall (Figure 1B), a finding that can be associated with hepatitis. A CT scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed effacement of sulci, a finding consistent with mild brain swelling. There was preservation of gray-white matter differentiation and no evidence of acute ischemia or acute intracranial hemorrhage. Chest Radiograph and Abdominal Ultrasound Image.A chest radiograph (Panel A) shows discoid atelectasis at the left lung base (arrow). An abdominal ultrasound image (Panel B) shows a thick, hypoechoic gallbladder wall (arrows). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for additional evaluation and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head, performed 22 hours later, revealed swelling of the cortex and thalami; increased signal was seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. There was also increased signal in the cortex and thalami on diffusion-weighted images and corresponding decreased signal on apparent diffusion coefficient maps; these findings are consistent with decreased diffusion, which signifies that the edema is cytotoxic (Figure 2). MRI of the Head.Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Panels A and B) show swelling of the cortex and thalami with increased signal, findings consistent with edema. On diffusion-weighted images (Panels C and D), the cortex and thalami have increased signal, and on apparent diffusion coefficient maps (Panels E and F), the cortex and thalami have decreased signal; these findings are consistent with decreased diffusion due to cytotoxic edema.

After 2 days, he saw a nurse practitioner at a local facility. Attempts at passing a catheter into his bladder were unsuccessful, and he was referred to a hospital in a larger city. Computed tomography (CT) performed without the administration of contrast material reportedly revealed a multilobulated mass (isodense to hyperdense and measuring 8 cm by 7.5 cm by 6.5 cm) in the urinary bladder, diffuse fat stranding in the perivesical and left periurethral regions, and bilateral intrarenal calculi and cysts. The next day, cystoscopic examination revealed an open prostatic urethra and brisk bleeding, making visualization of the bladder difficult.

Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly showed focal adenocarcinoma in situ that was thought to be of bladder origin and was associated with bland papillary and glandular epithelium, with no evidence of invasion. Five days later, bleeding persisted, and the patient was transferred to a second hospital, near his home. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral renal cysts and bilateral nonobstructing nephrolithiasis. The next day, repeat cystoscopy reportedly revealed a large fungating lesion and clot at the anterior bladder neck at the 12 o'clock position. Flushing of the bladder and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens reportedly showed adenocarcinoma; consultation with outside experts was pending. CT of the abdomen, performed the next day, reportedly revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. After decompression of the bladder with a catheter, irregular thickening of the bladder wall was seen, with an irregular, multiloculated gas collection, 2.5 cm by 3.5 cm, in the suprapubic region. The patient was discharged on the fifth day to follow up with his urologist. Nineteen days before this evaluation, transrectal biopsies of the prostate were performed with ultrasonographic guidance. Pathological examination of the specimens revealed adenocarcinoma in one of two cores from the right base, with a Gleason score of 7 (grade 3 plus grade 4) on a scale of 1 to 10 (with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis), involving 30% of the tissue, and adenocarcinoma in a core from the left lateral midportion, with a Gleason score of 6 (3+3), involving 10% of the tissue. The patient was referred to the cancer center of this hospital. He reported that hematuria and clot passage had resolved and that he felt well. He had a history of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary retention, for which a transurethral resection of the prostate had been performed elsewhere 12 years earlier. Pathological examination of the tissue reportedly had shown an area of focal high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. Four subsequent prostatic biopsies, the most recent performed 4 years before this evaluation, were negative for cancer. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), measured annually, had been normal until 5 days after the second cystoscopy, 1 month before this evaluation, when the level was 13.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, \u22644.0). The patient also had erectile dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diverticulosis, mild obstructive sleep apnea (for which he used continuous positive air pressure at night), and nephrolithiasis, which was treated with lithotripsy. Results of a colonoscopy performed 1 year earlier were normal. Medications included atorvastatin and verapamil; other medications (doxazosin, amlodipine, valsartan, telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, potassium aminobenzoic acid, oxybutynin chloride, and potassium chloride supplement) had recently been stopped. He was married, had adult children, and was retired from the shipping industry, where he had been exposed to asbestos. He was physically active in outdoor activities. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. There was no family history of urologic cancers. On examination, the pulse was 50 beats per minute and the blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.0. Rectal examination was not performed, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood potassium level was 3.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the urea nitrogen level 15 mg per deciliter (5.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]); the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2of body-surface area (reference range, \u226560). The complete blood count and levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal.

Ten days before this admission, fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias developed. The symptoms did not abate after the patient took aspirin and acetaminophen. Five days before this admission, she sought evaluation at the urgent care clinic of this hospital because Covid-19 had been diagnosed in two coworkers. A test for Covid-19 was not performed because of limited test availability; tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were not performed because of a statewide shortage of nasopharyngeal swabs. The patient was instructed to quarantine at home. During the next 5 days, the patient quarantined in a room in her apartment. Her husband periodically brought food to the door of the room. The fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, and myalgias persisted; new shortness of breath and anosmia developed. She had decreased appetite, and she consumed minimal food and drink. One day before this admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, and the patient sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and ketorolac were administered, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue to quarantine. On the day of admission, the patient had dizziness while standing, as well as shortness of breath, and she returned to the urgent care clinic of this hospital. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was anxious and tearful. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Intravenous fluid, ondansetron, and oral acetaminophen were administered. The dizziness resolved, and the fever, shortness of breath, and anxiety decreased. The patient was advised to return home to quarantine; however, she disclosed that if she were sent home, she planned to overdose on medications to die by suicide because of her anxiety and feelings of sadness and loneliness. Owing to concern about the patient\u2019s risk of harming herself, an order authorizing temporary involuntary hospitalization was implemented. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was brought to the emergency department. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported anxiety, palpitations, and shortness of breath and noted that her anxiety and feelings of isolation and loneliness had developed during quarantine. She also reported poor sleep, decreased energy, and anhedonia. The patient described that she felt like a burden to her husband and was terrified that she would transmit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to her children, including her 4-year-old son, who had been born prematurely and had a congenital pulmonary condition. In addition, the patient reported a 1-week history of new, recurring nightmares in which she would see herself playing with her own severed body parts; these nightmares occurred more frequently during periods of high fever. She intermittently had the sensation that someone was in the room with her while she was awake, even though she was aware that she was alone. She disclosed that, on the previous day, she had had new suicidal ideation associated with fear of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to her family and that she had taken five aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine pills at once. There had been no history of suicidal ideation or attempt, self-harm, or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of depression and panic attacks when she was a teenager and had been treated for less than 1 year with a medication that she could not recall; the symptoms had resolved by 19 years of age, and there had been no mental health follow-up. She also had a history of migraines, which occurred four times per week. She took aspirin, acetaminophen, and aspirin\u2013paracetamol\u2013caffeine as needed; there were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in Central America and had been living in the United States for 19 years. She lived with her husband, four children, and mother-in-law in an urban area of New England in a community that was predominantly Latinx and that had a high rate of Covid-19\u2013related infections and deaths. The patient did not complete high school while she was living in Central America and was currently employed full time in a food-production factory. She reported that she enjoyed her job but that she had been reluctant to work during the Covid-19 pandemic because of concern about becoming ill; however, she described that she felt obligated to work to support her family. The patient did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared well-groomed and fatigued, and she was tearful with a depressed and dysphoric mood. Her behavior was described as \u201csullen,\u201d and there was limited eye contact and reduced psychomotor activity. Her speech, in Spanish, was fluent but was slow and mumbling, with reduced prosody. She had no derailment of thought, delusions, or obsessions, but she ruminated on her nightmares. She stated that she had no current suicidal ideation but that she might attempt suicide if she had to return to her children and expose them to SARS-CoV-2 again. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was positive. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right middle and lower lobes and in the left lower lobe. Intravenous ceftriaxone, oral azithromycin, atorvastatin, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

The patient had had two previous uncomplicated pregnancies and was currently pregnant at 32 weeks of gestation with monochorionic, diamniotic twins. Her pregnancy had been monitored for polyhydramnios by her obstetrician with the use of serial fetal ultrasonography. Three weeks before presentation to this hospital, one of the patient\u2019s preschool-age children had an ear infection and the other had a sore throat. The patient had erythema in the eyes with greenish drainage, for which topical erythromycin and sulfacetamide were prescribed. One week later, a nonproductive cough complicated by a sore throat and ear pain developed. The patient also noted new edema in her legs that was not associated with pain, redness, or warmth. However, during the subsequent week, progressive pain in her right leg occurred, which prompted her to seek care at an emergency department of another hospital. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 113 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Pitting edema of the legs was noted, with no associated erythema, warmth, or tenderness on palpation of the calves. Ultrasonography of the right leg reportedly showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and a rapid test for streptococcal antigen was negative. While the patient was in the emergency department, painful uterine contractions with back discomfort developed; the cervix was 2 cm dilated. She was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for management of preterm labor. Intramuscular betamethasone and magnesium sulfate were administered for maturation of the fetal lungs and tocolysis, respectively. Continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution was initiated. Subcutaneous heparin was not administered, because delivery was thought to be imminent. After 24 hours of magnesium sulfate therapy, the uterine contractions remained unchanged, and no further cervical dilatation was noted. Because of concern about preterm labor, she remained hospitalized, with continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate. Five days after admission to the labor and delivery unit, the patient had tenderness in the left leg, and the edema in both legs had worsened. She also had episodes of severe coughing but reported no chest pain or shortness of breath. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/51 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed expiratory wheezes. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Doppler ultrasound examination of the legs revealed an occlusive thrombus in the left peroneal vein. The hematology service was consulted, and an intravenous heparin infusion was initiated. Intravenous furosemide and oral azithromycin and guaifenesin were also administered.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The next morning, after the patient had eaten breakfast, she had sudden severe, \u201ccrushing\u201d chest pain and became unresponsive and pulseless. Telemetry revealed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at a rate of 178 beats per minute, with a right bundle-branch block pattern with a superior axis. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and after the administration of epinephrine and cardioversion, the return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 4 minutes. Intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, propofol, and fentanyl were administered. The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory support was initiated. An emergency cesarean section was performed, and two healthy male infants were delivered, with an estimated intraoperative blood loss of 1600 ml. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening, findings that were consistent with pulmonary edema; bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion; cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement; and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery, which measured 3.8 cm in diameter. No pulmonary embolus was identified. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A contrast-enhanced coronal CT image in the pulmonary angiographic phase (Panel A) shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening compatible with pulmonary edema. A contrast-enhanced axial CT image in the pulmonary angiographic phase (Panel B) shows cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis in the lower lobes (arrows). A chest radiograph obtained at the time of transfer to this hospital (Panel C) shows interstitial pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, a trace left pleural effusion, and left basilar atelectasis. The venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) inflow cannula and the tip of a central venous catheter are visible in the right atrium, and an endotracheal tube and enteric tubes are in appropriate positions. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed biventricular dilatation and severely decreased biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for further treatment. On arrival at the second hospital, 210 minutes after the cardiac arrest, the pulse was 177 beats per minute, and the mean arterial pressure was 65 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. Physical examination was notable for diffusely coarse breath sounds, rapid regular heart sounds, and generalized edema. Thirty minutes after arrival at the second hospital, the patient underwent cannulation for femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and an intravenous infusion of milrinone was initiated. Ventricular tachycardia recurred; intravenous magnesium and lidocaine were administered, and the arrhythmia was terminated with cardioversion. Plans were made to transfer the patient by helicopter to this hospital, and intravenous vecuronium was given in preparation for transport. During the flight, severe vaginal bleeding developed, and 2 units of packed red cells were transfused; however, the heparin infusion was continued, given the presence of the ECMO circuit. On arrival at this hospital, 10 hours after the cardiac arrest, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s sister and grandmother. The patient had a history of childhood asthma, obesity, anxiety, and depression. She had previously delivered two healthy, full-term children; her current pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus and polyhydramnios of one of the fetuses. Her medication history included insulin, inhaled albuterol, sertraline, iron sulfate, and folic acid. She had had no known adverse drug reactions. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was married and had two healthy preschool-age children, in addition to her two newborns.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progressively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an ankle\u2013foot orthosis. One year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as occasional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of serum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate-3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference value, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side. The patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes, no double vision or hearing changes, and no difficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medications included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a steppage gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait. There was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Strength was assessed according to the Medical Research Council scale, which ranges from 0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4+, respectively, on shoulder abduction; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4\u2212 on ankle eversion. On both sides, strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee flexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps, 1+ at the triceps, trace at the brachioradialis, 2+ at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging studies were obtained. MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1) revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impingement on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis. MRI of the Lumbar Spine.A parasagittal T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows severe neural foraminal stenosis on the left side that is impinging on the exiting left L5 nerve root (arrow). An axial T2-weighted image (Panel B) shows a diffuse disk bulge that is in contact with, and is possibly impinging on, the descending left S1 nerve root (arrow); there is no high-grade central spinal stenosis at this level.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when a deep ache developed in her left triceps, in the absence of trauma. During the following weeks, the pain persisted, gradually spreading to both arms and both legs, and was exacerbated by movement; she began having difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs because of pain. Two weeks before admission, examination by her primary care physician at another hospital reportedly revealed no focal muscle weakness. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and glucose were normal, as were renal-function tests; testing for parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibodies was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Three days before admission, pain and swelling in the left arm worsened. She returned to the other hospital. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus andBorrelia burgdorferiwere negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient returned home, with persistent symptoms. Three days later, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient reported restricted range of motion of her arms because of pain, as well as stiffness in her proximal arm muscles that was worse in the morning. She also reported intermittent nondrenching night sweats that she attributed to menopause. She reported no muscle weakness, fever, chills, malaise, dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, synovitis, weight loss, numbness or tingling in her hands, shortness of breath, chest pain, changes in bowel or bladder function, nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, or rash. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids with menorrhagia had been made 2 years earlier. Routine mammograms had been normal. Her only medication was megestrol acetate, taken midcycle (10 days per month). She had no known allergies. She was single, physically active, and had traveled widely. She drank alcohol in moderation, and she did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had breast cancer at age 65 years, and her father had had a myocardial infarction at age 57 years. There was no family history of rheumatologic or neuromuscular disorders. On examination, the blood pressure was 113/82 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the temperature 36.7\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. When she was standing, her pulse increased to 120 beats per minute, without symptoms of dyspnea or light-headedness. Her voice was slightly gravelly, which she reported was unchanged. There was firm, nonpitting swelling and tenderness to palpation on the right shoulder and from the left shoulder to the hand. Both calves were tender to palpation, without visible swelling. Gait and muscle strength were normal, and she could easily squat, stand, and rise up on either foot on tiptoe. There was no rash, evidence of nail-bed infarcts, or impairment of respiratory excursions; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and thyrotropin. Results of renal-function tests were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, 3+ ketones, and trace occult blood and albumin; few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells were seen per high-power field. Screening of the urine for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and toxins was negative. Ultrasonography of the left arm and right leg showed no deep venous thrombosis. A chest radiograph showed a soft-tissue opacity, 9.0 cm by 9.0 cm by 12.4 cm, in the right lower hemithorax that obscured the right heart border, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema (Figure 1A). The opacity was seen anteriorly on the lateral view. The appearance was suggestive of an anterior mediastinal mass. Computed tomography (CT) after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1B and 1C) confirmed the presence of a large, anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with a smooth margin and heterogeneous density but with no evidence of internal calcification or fat. The mass abutted the right pericardium, with no distinct fat plane between the mass and the pericardium. There was no evidence of invasion into the pericardium. There was a small pericardial effusion. The superior vena cava was patent, but there was compression of the right atrium. There was no evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. There was no connection between the mass and the thyroid gland. The differential diagnosis included a thymic neoplasm, lymphoma, and a germ-cell tumor. In view of the absence of connection to the thyroid gland, a thyroid origin was unlikely. Lymphoma was considered to be unlikely in the absence of any other evidence of lymphadenopathy. Chest Images.A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Panel A) shows a soft-tissue opacity with a smooth margin (arrows) in the right lower thorax, silhouetting the right heart border. An axial CT image (Panel B) shows a large right anterior mediastinal mass abutting the right pericardium (arrows) with a small pericardial effusion (arrowhead). The mass causes external compression of the right atrium (RA). A coronal reformatted image (Panel C) from a contrast-enhanced CT scan shows the craniocaudal extent of the mass. The superior vena cava (arrow) is patent. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 111 beats per minute, left atrial enlargement, and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Blood levels of parathyroid hormone, hCG, and alpha-fetoprotein were normal, and testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and Jo-1 was negative.

Thirty months before this admission, the patient presented to another hospital with upper respiratory symptoms, throat swelling, and anemia. On the basis of the results of a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. Induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine was administered, followed by consolidation chemotherapy with three cycles of high-dose cytarabine. Subsequently, the patient was in complete remission. One year later, a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia occurred, and mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine were administered. Two months later, fever, fatigue, pleuritic chest pain, and dry cough developed, and the patient presented to a second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed multifocal nodular opacities, and the patient was treated with vancomycin. She was transferred to the first hospital, where a CT-guided lung biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed hyphae with septations, a finding that was consistent with invasive aspergillus infection. Micafungin was administered, followed by voriconazole, for a total of 12 months thereafter. Six weeks after the lung biopsy was performed (approximately 14 months before this admission), the patient was admitted to this hospital for bone marrow transplantation. After she received a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and melphalan, a double-unit cord-blood transplantation was performed. The hospital course after transplantation was complicated byStaphylococcus aureusbacteremia, respiratory failure that led to mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury that led to temporary hemodialysis, and duodenal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that was treated with glucocorticoids, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Results of a bone marrow biopsy that was performed 100 days after the transplantation were consistent with complete remission, with no evidence of recurrent leukemia. Four months before this admission, sore throat, odynophagia, and cough occurred and were thought to be caused by recurrent tonsillitis. Three courses of antimicrobial therapy (including cefuroxime and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid) were administered, and 3 months later, a tonsillectomy was performed at an affiliated hospital. Seven days before this admission, after a 2-day summer camping trip in New England, fatigue, progressive dyspnea, and diffuse myalgias occurred, followed by chills, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, rigors, and fever (to a temperature of 38.7\u00b0C). On examination in the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient had hypoxemia, with an oxygen saturation of 85% while she was breathing ambient air. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed new bilateral ground-glass opacities and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Levofloxacin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered intravenously. Approximately 20 hours after presentation, the patient was transferred to this hospital. During the previous week, the patient had had loose, nonbloody stools and abdominal pain, with no other abdominal symptoms, cough, sputum production, headache, rash, or arthralgias. She had hypothyroidism, asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and depression; in the past, she had had a catheter-associated thrombus of the right subclavian vein and had undergone a cesarean section. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, montelukast, amlodipine, aripiprazole, sertraline, levothyroxine, and zolpidem, as well as an albuterol inhaler as needed. She was allergic to house dust mites. She reported that she had had no tick bites or animal exposures during the recent camping trip and had had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in a hair salon and lived with her son. She drank alcohol socially, had smoked cigarettes for 3 years in the past, and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had had melanoma, and her paternal grandfather had had rheumatoid arthritis. There was no other family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/72 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 90% while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, 92% while she was using a nonrebreather face mask, and 94% while she was breathing high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. She had scattered fine crackles, wheezes, and high-pitched inspiratory \u201csqueaks\u201d and \u201cpops\u201d in both lungs diffusely. There was very mild tenderness in the mid-epigastrium. The remainder of the examination was normal. On admission, vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, furosemide, and methylprednisone were administered intravenously, and ipratropium\u2013albuterol was administered by inhalation. The prothrombin time and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Cultures of the sputum, urine, and blood were performed. Testing for legionella andPneumocystis jiroveciiin the sputum and legionella antigen in the urine was negative, as was nucleic-acid testing for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On admission, chest radiography (Figure 1A) revealed a faint patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and trace bilateral pleural effusions. Chest CT (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes, opacities in small airways of the lower lobes that were consistent with mucous plugging, bronchial-wall thickening, and bilateral pulmonary nodules that had progressed since the previous CT study had been obtained (at the second hospital 2 days earlier). A small nodule in the right upper lobe represented a scar from the previous aspergillus infection. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and trace bilateral pleural effusions were also noted. Imaging Studies of the Chest.An anteroposterior chest radiograph shows a faint patchy opacity in the left upper lobe (Panel A). A chest CT scan shows bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities that are most prominent in the upper lobes (Panel B), opacities in small airways of the lower lobes that are consistent with mucous plugging (Panel C, oval), bronchial-wall thickening (Panel C, arrow), bilateral pulmonary nodules that have progressed since the previous study was obtained (2 days earlier), and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Panel D, arrows). Eight hours after admission, the patient had a dry cough, progressive dyspnea, increased crackles on lung auscultation, and worsened hypoxemia, with an intermittent decline in the oxygen saturation to 75% despite the delivery of high-flow oxygen. Ceftazidime was administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Twenty-two hours after admission, an endotracheal tube was placed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Bronchoscopic examination revealed thin, foamy secretions in the left and right bronchi, with mild, diffuse airway erythema.

Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the patient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had possible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started.

He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respiratory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early childhood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed. At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointestinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypothyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymphadenopathy. The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60).

Intravenous fluids were administered, and empirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive.

The patient had been well until 3.3 years before this presentation, when episodic bilateral epistaxis developed, associated with intermittent sore throat, blood-tinged sputum, and nasal crusting, without rhinorrhea. Two months after the onset of symptoms, examination by an otolaryngologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary revealed a straight septum, with active bleeding bilaterally. Cauterization with silver nitrate was performed, followed by packing; nasal dryness and intermittent bleeding persisted. Six months after the onset of symptoms, fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examination revealed crusting in the nose, mucosal inflammation, and synechiae in the left nasal cavity, without masses or polyps. Amoxicillin with clavulanate was prescribed. Three months later, surgical repair of bilateral nasal vestibular stenosis, with polymeric-silicone splints, and biopsies were performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy specimens showed superficial fragments of squamous mucosa with mild atypia, hyperkeratosis, a prominent granular layer, and no evidence of cancer. A tapering course of prednisone (starting at 40 mg daily) and topical triamcinolone acetonide cream were administered, with partial improvement. During the next year, symptoms persisted despite multiple fiberoptic nasal endoscopic examinations, d\u00e9bridement of the crusted tissue, the application of topical antibiotic unguent, and nasal rinses. Approximately 20 months after the onset of symptoms, examination revealed complete obstruction of the nasal passages, with scab formation and no polyps or discharge; nasal cultures grew normal flora. Additional d\u00e9bridement was followed by the application of mupirocin ointment. Follow-up cultures grew moderate anaerobes and fewStaphylococcus aureus. A 2-week course of clindamycin was prescribed. Approximately 1 year before this evaluation, painful ulcers developed on the buccal mucosa and tongue. Multiple courses of prednisone (up to 40 mg daily, rapidly tapering over a period of 1 week) were administered, with transient improvement during each course. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and antinuclear antibodies was negative. A chest radiograph and results of computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses were normal. During the next 4 months, episodes of epistaxis increased in frequency, in association with nasal crusting and sinus congestion. Eight months before this evaluation, on evaluation by a rheumatologist at this hospital, the patient reported dyspnea, cough, fatigue, ear fullness, and weight loss of 7 kg. Examination revealed normal vital signs and an ulceration on the tip of the tongue; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of thyroid peroxidase antibody was 291.0 IU per milliliter (reference range, <35.0), and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were positive at 1:40 dilution (reference, negative at 1:10). The complete blood count was normal, as were the levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM); results of tests of renal and liver function and serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Testing for syphilis (with the use of rapid plasma reagin), rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and ANCA was negative, as was testing for antibodies to Ro, La, Sm, and ribonuclear protein. Colchicine, 0.6 mg twice daily, was administered for 1 week but was stopped because of diarrhea. The patient began to use dexamethasone elixir mouthwash, with improvement in the oral lesions. CT of the chest revealed a hiatal hernia. Approximately 5 months before this evaluation, intermittent rectal bleeding developed. Colonoscopic examination performed at another hospital reportedly showed two ulcers, 25 cm from the anal verge, without surrounding inflammation. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions showed no evidence of ulceration or vasculitis; there were mild nonspecific findings of focal acute cryptitis and rare lymphoid aggregates. Serologic evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease was reportedly negative except for the presence of IgG antibodies toSaccharomyces cerevisiae(34.9 ELISA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] units per milliliter; reference range, <17.8). Omeprazole, colchicine, and vitamin B were prescribed, without improvement. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain of the oral ulcers at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain, and reported recurrent epistaxis, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, arthralgias, and intermittent pain in the elbows and legs, without swelling, erythema, or increased warmth. She did not have alopecia, uveitis, rash (malar or other), genital ulcers, or anal or perianal fistulas. She had a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, hyperlipidemia, and migraines. A transient ischemic attack had occurred 3.5 years before this evaluation, associated with tinnitus in the right ear, numbness and weakness on the left side, and possible aphasia; the symptoms had resolved after several hours. Daily medications included atenolol, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, levothyroxine, prednisone (20 mg, tapering from 40 mg over a period of 7 days), simvastatin, and aspirin (81 mg). She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin with clavulanate, erythromycin, and tetracycline (which had caused rashes), and ciprofloxacin. The patient was married, had two grown children, and worked in an office. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother and sister had celiac disease, and her sister also had scleroderma. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/91 mm Hg and other vital signs were normal. The weight was 76.2 kg. The oropharynx was pink, with numerous erosions of the mucous membranes of the mouth, including the tongue, soft palate, and inner buccal mucosa, without bleeding (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and level of C-reactive protein were normal.

Approximately 19 months before admission, 1 week after the patient had begun taking citalopram, the development of oral erosions, tongue swelling, and urticarial lesions, approximately 1 cm in diameter, on her torso occurred. These symptoms were followed during the next several weeks by joint pain and swelling in her hands, fatigue, and low-grade fevers. Citalopram was stopped, and antihistamines were prescribed, which the patient reported that she did not take for religious reasons; during the next month, the lesions worsened. She was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported difficulty eating because of oral ulcers; she also reported pain on urination and defecation because of vaginal and anal lesions. She had a history of obesity, hypertension, and depression. Nine months before that admission (27 months before the current admission), she had an episode ofStreptococcus pneumoniaebacteremia associated with a tubo-ovarian abscess and complicated by bacterial endocarditis, infectious endophthalmitis (causing near-total blindness), and a myocardial infarction due to a septic embolus from valvular vegetation. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed at that time. Medications included furosemide, metoprolol tartrate, aspirin (81 mg daily), diphenhydramine (as needed for itching), and a multivitamin. She was divorced and lived alone; she did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. For religious reasons, she was reluctant to take medications and was distrustful of the medical system. She was of African-American descent and had one adult child; her father had died in an accident, her mother had hypertension, and an aunt had breast cancer. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable because of oral lesions. The temperature was 38.7\u00b0C. There were erosions on the inner lips and buccal mucosa, and there was edema of the lips. There were erythematous plaques with dusky centers on the abdomen; coalescent, erythematous, mildly scaly symmetric plaques on the back; and small oval erosions in the perianal area and vagina. The wrist, metacarpal, and proximal interphalangeal joints were tender, without swelling or erythema. Pathological examination of a cutaneous-biopsy specimen revealed interface dermatitis (a finding consistent with erythema multiforme) and a mild increase in dermal mucin deposition. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir were administered; acyclovir was stopped when cultures for herpes simplex virus were negative. Screening for cold agglutinins was negative. When the course of antibiotics was completed, prednisone (40 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine were prescribed, but she refused the medication. She was discharged on the 12th day. Discharge medications included prednisone (40 mg daily), hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), diphenhydramine (as needed), fluocinolone ointment (0.025%), and betamethasone dipropionate ointment (0.05%). Laboratory Data. Eighteen days later (17 months before this admission), the patient was readmitted because of a persistent and increasingly painful erosive, pruritic rash on her back; the oral and anogenital lesions had resolved. She reported not taking prednisone or hydroxychloroquine. Examination revealed erythematous scaly plaques with central erosions on the back, chest, thighs, and buttocks. Laboratory results are shown inTable 1. A second skin-biopsy specimen showed findings consistent with bullous lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone were prescribed, but the patient declined the medications. She was discharged on the seventh day. Six weeks later, the patient was admitted to Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) because of worsening blistering and erosive skin lesions during the past week. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C. Erythroderma of the face and torso was present (Figure 1A and 1B); there were erosions and large flakes of desquamation and scattered, fragile flaccid bullae and open blisters covering approximately 70% of the body-surface area, predominantly on the upper chest and breasts, with only a few plaques on the lower body and legs, and no lesions on the palms, soles, oral mucosa, or genitalia. Pathological examination of a third skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed findings consistent with pemphigus foliaceus. Methylprednisolone (125 mg daily) was administered intravenously for 3 days, followed by a tapering course of prednisone (60 mg daily for 3 days, then 50 mg daily) and topical clobetasol, with rapid improvement in the skin lesions. The patient was discharged on the eighth day (first to a rehabilitation hospital, then home), and she indicated that she would adhere to hydroxychloroquine and prednisone therapy. The administration of hydroxychloroquine was begun, and prednisone was tapered. Clinical Photographs of the Patient.Approximately 15 months before admission, erythroderma involving the face (Panel A) and torso (Panel B) were present, with erosions and large flakes of desquamation and scattered, fragile flaccid bullae and open blisters covering approximately 70% of the body-surface area. On admission, there were multiple flaccid bullous lesions and superficial erosions, with crusting and mild oozing on the back (Panel C), chest (Panel D), abdomen, and both arms and shoulders (not shown). (Panels A and B courtesy of Drs. Elena Hawryluk and Lily Uhlein, Department of Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Panels C and D courtesy of Drs. Amir Aboutalebi and Sabina Bis, Department of Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital.) At a follow-up examination at BWH 10 days after discharge, there were no active skin lesions. After 3 months, the patient stopped keeping follow-up appointments with the dermatology service at BWH and declined follow-up with rheumatology. Seven months before admission, at a follow-up appointment with her internist at this hospital, she reported taking hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily), prednisone (5 mg daily), furosemide, metoprolol, aspirin, diphenhydramine, and topical glucocorticoid ointments, and she had no active skin lesions. Sometime thereafter, she stopped taking hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. Eight days before this admission, the patient returned to her internist because of recurrent skin lesions and alopecia. There were tender, pruritic skin lesions on her scalp that were ulcerated and excoriated and in the periumbilical area. She declined admission but resumed using hydroxychloroquine and topical betamethasone valerate lotion (0.1%); the administration of vitamin A and D ointment was added. She declined oral prednisone therapy because of concern about diabetes mellitus and weight gain. On the day of admission, the patient was brought to the emergency department at this hospital because of worsening skin lesions and increasing pain (rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There were multiple flaccid bullous lesions and superficial erosions, with crusting and mild oozing on the chest, back, abdomen, and both arms and shoulders (Figure 1C and 1D). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and renal function; other results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Oxycodone (5 mg) was administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admission, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diarrhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treatment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Nine months before this admission,Clostridioides difficilecolitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative colitis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were administered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon. A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admission showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage. The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient reported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. At the time of the current admission, medications included prednisone, mesalamine, omeprazole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, lorazepam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two children. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to animals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflammatory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well. On examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdominal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was normal. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild fullness in the pelvicalyceal system on the right side (Figure 1A) that is probably a physiologic finding in pregnancy. There was trace fluid in the right lower quadrant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Figure 1B). Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.A color Doppler ultrasound image of the right kidney shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system (Panel A) that is probably a physiologic finding in a pregnant woman. A sagittal color Doppler ultrasound image of the right lower quadrant (Panel B) shows trace fluid; however, the appendix is not visualized. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reveals a normal gravid uterus. A sagittal T2-weighted single-shot fast spin\u2013echo (SSFSE) image of the uterus (Panel C) shows rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity (arrow) that are consistent with focal myometrial contractions. A heavily windowed coronal T2-weighted SSFSE image of the uterus (Panel D) shows a thin band of low signal intensity (arrows) surrounding the fetus that is consistent with chorioamniotic separation, a normal finding in the first trimester. An axial T2-weighted SSFSE image of the abdomen (Panel E) and an axial image of the abdomen obtained with short-tau inversion recovery parameters (Panel F) reveal a normal appendix (Panel E, arrowheads) without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. The rectum, which can be seen in Panel C, shows no wall thickening, mural stratification, or proliferation of mesorectal fat, although evaluation of the bowel is limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material. Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and care. The next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limitation in the range of motion in the neck. Empirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started. On the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound images of the uterus obtained at the bedside confirmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were considered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic inflammation.

Four years before the current presentation, a skin eruption on the right foot and a lesion on the tongue developed. A biopsy of both lesions was performed at another hospital; examination of the specimens revealed evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Prednisone, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine were administered, and the mucocutaneous lesions improved, but they recurred after any attempt to taper the immunosuppressive medications. Twenty-one months before the current presentation, headaches developed and skin lesions recurred. The headaches were generally located in the right temporal area, were characterized as throbbing, and lasted approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with contrast enhancement was performed. Axial, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed hyperintensity in the right thalamocapsular region and right midbrain, with patchy enhancement of the right midbrain (Figure 1). MRI of the Head Obtained 21 Months before Presentation.Axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images show hyperintensity in the right thalamocapsular region (Panel A, arrow) and right midbrain (Panel B, arrow), with patchy enhancement of the right midbrain (Panel C, arrow). A lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the protein level was 54 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the total nucleated-cell count was 16 per cubic millimeter, with 66% lymphocytes. The opening pressure was not measured. A test for cryptococcal antigen and nucleic-acid tests for toxoplasma, JC virus, herpes simplex virus types I and II, and varicella\u2013zoster virus were negative. Flow cytometry did not show any abnormal cell populations. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis was made. Prednisone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and hydroxychloroquine were administered, and the headaches improved temporarily. Two months later, repeat MRI of the head reportedly showed resolution of the hyperintensity that had been seen previously. Eighteen months before the current presentation, the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic at this hospital for the evaluation of recurrent painful mucocutaneous lesions of the hands, feet, and mouth. She also reported fatigue and arthralgias of the hands, knees, and ankles. Blood tests revealed antinuclear antibodies (at a titer of >1:5120, with a speckled pattern) and anti-Ro antibodies (154.60 optical-density units; normal range, <19.99), as well as hypocomplementemia. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was suspected. Prednisone and hydroxychloroquine were continued, and mycophenolate mofetil was added to the regimen. Cyclophosphamide and rituximab were stopped. Over the next 15 months, the patient had exacerbations of the cutaneous vasculitis whenever the prednisone dose was tapered. Three months before the current presentation, the prednisone dose was increased because of worsening lesions on the hands and feet. During the 6 weeks before this presentation, sporadic episodes of transient vision loss occurred. The episodes lasted 5 to 10 seconds, occurred one to several times per day, and remitted spontaneously. They were associated with dizziness, pulsatile tinnitus, and headaches. The headaches reportedly worsened with changes in position, such as bending over, but there appeared to be no relationship between the headaches and time of day, diet, activity, or performance of the Valsalva maneuver. The patient was evaluated by an ophthalmologist 1 week before the current presentation and then evaluated by her neurologist at another facility 6 days later. On neurologic evaluation, the blood pressure was 114/72 mm Hg. Bilateral optic-disk swelling was noted, but the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. MRI of the head was performed. One day later, the patient was evaluated by her rheumatologist at this hospital. She reported ongoing mucocutaneous symptoms, including painful swelling on the right lip, a painful ulcer on the palate, and pruritic lesions on the feet. There was no diplopia, neck stiffness, photophobia, sonophobia, general or focal weakness, paresthesia, ataxia, syncope, fever, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or bowel or bladder dysfunction. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for weight gain of 22.7 kg over a 4-year period in the context of glucocorticoid treatment and glucocorticoid-related osteoporosis. Her medications included prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D. Rituximab had been readministered 9 days earlier. The patient was originally from the eastern Mediterranean and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. She was divorced and had one adolescent son. She had previously worked in the restaurant business but had to discontinue this work because of physical limitations. She had an 8.5-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and continued to smoke several cigarettes a day, but she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father had valvular heart disease, and her maternal grandmother had had a stroke. Her sisters were healthy, and there was no family history of neurologic, ophthalmologic, or rheumatologic disease. On examination, the temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 94 kg. The patient appeared mildly unwell, was tearful, and had cushingoid features. The bilateral optic-disk swelling was confirmed, but the remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. A small pink lump was noted on the right upper lip, and an ulcer was present on the hard palate. There were multiple splinterlike ulcerations on the fingers, nonblanching tender patches with a livedoid pattern and excoriations on the toes, and purple papules on the feet.

The pupils were equal in size and had a normal response to light. Results of testing with the use of an Amsler grid and an Ishihara color plate were within normal limits. Humphrey visual-field testing revealed enlarged blind spots in both eyes. Applanation tonometry revealed an intraocular pressure of 11 mm Hg in the right eye and 10 mm Hg in the left eye. On external examination, the eyelids and ocular adnexa were normal. Results of a slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination were normal in both eyes. A dilated-pupil fundus examination revealed extensive bilateral optic-disk edema (grade 4 on the Fris\u00e9n scale, which ranges from 0 to 5, with higher grades indicating more severe edema) and associated subretinal fluid, as well as peripapillary folds in the left eye and multiple peripapillary hemorrhages in both eyes.

The patient had been in her usual state of health, which included recreational swimming and hiking, until 3 weeks before this admission, when she noted an abrupt onset of dark, rust-colored urine after a trip to Europe. During her trip, she had increased her intake of alcohol. She had no other bleeding symptoms and reported no dysuria, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight change, nausea, emesis, or antecedent trauma; she took no nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Dark urine occurred with every instance of urination. She decided on her own to reduce her dose of warfarin, which she had been taking for 25 years after mechanical mitral-valve and aortic-valve replacements, and to take one dose of ciprofloxacin, which had been left over from a previous prescription. One week later, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. Examination was notable for a slightly sallow complexion. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urine dipstick testing was positive for blood, and a urine specimen was obtained for culture.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2021This value was obtained at the point of care. Ten days later, the patient reported fatigue with activity, and imaging studies were performed. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed only a punctate nonobstructing renal stone in the left kidney. Outpatient cystoscopy was reportedly unrevealing. Four days later, the fatigue increased, and the patient reported feeling \u201cvery weak,\u201d with exertional dyspnea manifesting as a \u201chard time with walking\u201d; her husband noted that she appeared pale, and she presented to her primary care physician for additional evaluation. Examination revealed a systolic murmur and skin pallor. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, the haptoglobin level was undetectable, and the levels of folate and vitamin B12were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, after the results became available, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for pale and yellow skin, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on modest exertion. The patient reported that her arms and legs felt heavy, without pain or paresthesia. There was no chest pain or pressure, palpitations, edema, or orthopnea. She reported no bleeding from the oropharynx, nose, vagina, or rectum and no bruising. There were no fevers, chills, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or other genitourinary symptoms. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, resection of breast ductal carcinoma along with axillary lymph-node dissection, and rheumatic fever during adolescence. Two decades after having rheumatic fever, she had severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis with moderate mitral regurgitation that was complicated by heart failure, exercise intolerance, and pulmonary hypertension; she underwent mechanical bileaflet tilting-disk aortic-valve and mitral-valve replacements 25 years before this admission. Medications included warfarin and atorvastatin. Her warfarin treatment was managed by a local clinic, and her international normalized ratio (INR) was checked approximately every 3 to 4 weeks; historically, her INRs were within the range of 2.0 to 2.5. There were no adverse reactions to either medication. She lived with her husband and was a former teacher. She was active and enjoyed swimming and hiking. She did not smoke or use illicit substances; she drank wine in social settings. There was no family history of cardiac, renal, or hematologic disease. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 144/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.9. On examination, she appeared pale and mildly jaundiced but otherwise generally well. Examination of the eyes revealed scleral icterus. There was no evidence of bleeding, petechiae, or ecchymoses in the oropharynx or on the skin. The jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed crisp metallic S1 and S2 sounds, a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur (grade 1/6) at the right upper sternal border, a harsh systolic murmur (grade 3/6) at the apex, and clear lungs. There was no organomegaly or suprapubic tenderness. No enlarged lymph nodes were identified. Distal pulses were intact, the hands and feet were warm, and there was no edema. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lactate, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin B12, and folate were normal, as were the results of tests of renal function; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, borderline R-wave progression in the precordial leads, and submillimeter ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads. An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest (Figure 1A) showed sternal wires, chondrocalcinosis, and clear lungs, as well as enlargement of the left atrium. The valve prostheses were not well visualized. Initial Chest Radiograph and Transthoracic Echocardiogram.A posteroanterior radiograph (Panel A) shows left atrial enlargement. The valve prostheses are not well visualized, in part because of the presence of chondrocalcinosis. On transthoracic echocardiography, an apical two-chamber view (Panel B) shows perivalvular and submitral calcification (orange arrows), which does not interfere with the movement of the mechanical mitral-valve bileaflet tilting-disk prosthesis (purple arrow). There is symmetric opening and closing of the mitral-valve disks, as inferred from the appearance of symmetric acoustic reverberation from the prosthetic disk motion (red arrow). An acoustic shadow (blue arrow) cast by the perivalvular and submitral calcification is also noted. A color Doppler image (Panel C) shows the reverberation and shadowing of the mechanical mitral-valve prosthesis (arrow) that is preventing adequate assessment of any potential mitral regurgitation by color Doppler. LA denotes left atrium, and LV left ventricle. Point-of-care cardiac ultrasonography that was performed in the emergency department reportedly revealed normal biventricular function, no evidence of pericardial effusion, and a possible clot on the mitral valve. Intravenous heparin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology inpatient unit. On the second day of hospitalization, a transthoracic echocardiogram (Figure 1B and 1CandVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed nondilated left and right ventricles with normal systolic function and mobile chordae tendineae in the left ventricular cavity consistent with previous mitral-valve replacement. The mechanical aortic prosthesis was well seated with a mean transaortic pressure gradient of 14 mm Hg and with mild regurgitation. The mechanical mitral prosthesis was well seated with extensive perimitral annular calcification that extended to the mitral subvalvular apparatus but did not interfere with the opening and closing of the prosthetic mitral-valve disks, without evidence of thrombosis on the valve. The mean transmitral pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg measured at 80 beats per minute. Mitral regurgitation could not be assessed owing to acoustic reverberation and shadowing. Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation was present with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 45 mm Hg. There was no echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary-valve disease, ventricular septal defect, left ventricular outflow obstruction, or pericardial effusion.

The patient had been in his usual state of health and walking 3 miles per day until 5 weeks before the current admission, when fatigue developed. During his daily walks, he began resting after walking a quarter mile because of fatigue; there was no chest pain, dyspnea, or leg pain. In addition, he began taking naps during the day, which was unusual for him. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to his primary care provider for evaluation. Laboratory studies reportedly revealed hyponatremia. He was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. In the emergency department, the patient reported no history of orthopnea or leg swelling, although his weight had increased by 2.2 kg during the past year. He reported eating and drinking normally, with no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He had no weakness, loss of sensation, headache, or vision changes. Other medical history was notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications included lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin; there were no known allergies to medications. He had smoked tobacco in the past but had quit 40 years earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He was a retired teacher and lived with his wife in New England. His family history included heart disease in his father and pancreatic cancer in his mother. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 156/76 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 74.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The physical examination was normal. The blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient received 250 ml of intravenous isotonic fluids. Four hours later, the blood sodium level was 127 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to stop taking hydrochlorothiazide and to follow up with his primary care physician; he was discharged from the emergency department.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. After the patient returned home, his fatigue diminished. One week later, involuntary movements in the left arm and hand developed. The patient described the movements as spasms that caused the arm to flex at the elbow or wrist. The episodes lasted less than 5 seconds and occurred multiple times per day. They often occurred after position changes or sudden movements and often caused him to drop any object he was holding in his left hand. He described feeling a strange sensation immediately before the movements but being unable to suppress them. The patient\u2019s wife had noticed that occasionally during the involuntary movements of the left arm and hand, the left side of the patient\u2019s face pulled to the side as though he were grimacing. The episodes increased in frequency during the next 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after discharge from the emergency department, the patient returned to this hospital for additional evaluation. On evaluation, the patellar reflexes were 3+; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood levels of thyrotropin and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal. The blood cortisol level was 13.5 \u03bcg per deciliter; 30 minutes after the administration of 250 \u03bcg of cosyntropin, the blood cortisol level was 27.9 \u03bcg per deciliter. The patient received 1 liter of intravenous isotonic fluids. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild, scattered, nonspecific hypoattenuation of the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Ten hours later, the blood sodium level was 121 mmol per liter. The patient was asked to limit his intake of water to less than 1 liter per day, and sodium chloride tablets were administered. Twelve hours later, the blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. A single, unwitnessed episode of involuntary movement of the left arm and left side of the face occurred. On the second and third hospital days, intravenous desmopressin and hypertonic fluids were administered, and the blood sodium level gradually increased to 132 mmol per liter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material; T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed mild, scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the scan showed a small cluster of nodules and linear opacities in the right middle lobe and multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints. On the fourth hospital day, the administration of intravenous hypertonic fluids and desmopressin was stopped, oral furosemide was added, and sodium chloride tablets were continued. Over the next 3 days, the blood sodium level increased to 137 mmol per liter. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day having had no additional episodes of involuntary movements. The blood sodium level was normal 2 days after discharge and again 8 days after discharge. The patient was instructed to drink water when he was thirsty without limiting his daily intake. Two weeks after discharge, the patient noticed recurrence of the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face. He was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal, and no involuntary movements were observed. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to limit his intake of water to 2 liters per day. Four weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital. He reported that the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face had increased in frequency, occurring once per hour. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. He was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.

Three years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements. Two years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any intervention. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity. Four months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep \u2014 including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams \u2014 continued and were most prominent in the early morning hours. The patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of generalized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural instability, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles). One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3\u2013C4 bilaterally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white-matter changes (Figure 1). MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed 4 months before the current evaluation. Diffusion-weighted images (Panels A and B) and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel C) show a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale (arrows). FLAIR images (Panels C and D) show nonspecific moderate-to-severe background white-matter changes. T2-weighted images (Panels E and F) show chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebellar hemisphere (arrows). Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutritional, and paraproteinemic causes of the patient\u2019s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated. The patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen desaturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position. The patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation. On evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit comfortably. In addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient\u2019s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regarding his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy; other history included hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, insulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Elevation of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups. Deep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alternating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg test showed truncal titubation. A sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was performed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but there were no abnormal behaviors. Two weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was transported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence. However, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient\u2019s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep.

The patient had been in her usual health until approximately 3 months before this presentation, when mild swelling of her left leg developed. Three days before this presentation, pain in the back, both flanks, and left leg developed and the leg swelling increased. She came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported no trauma, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. She had arthritis, asthma, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and non\u2013insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the remote past, she had reportedly had a positive tuberculin skin test. She had undergone a partial colectomy for resection of a stage T1 colon cancer (without adjuvant chemotherapy) 7 years earlier, as well as a lumpectomy of the left breast, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Medications included metformin, triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, atorvastatin, aspirin, loratadine, and, as needed, an albuterol inhaler. She had no known allergies. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and of African-American ancestry. Her father had had Alzheimer\u2019s disease and diabetes mellitus; her mother had had heart disease and breast cancer; a sister had breast cancer; a brother had hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease; and two brothers had had diabetes mellitus and had died before they were 70 years of age. Her children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 150/77 mm Hg, and the pulse 75 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. There was paraspinal tenderness in the lumbar region and mild (1+) nonpitting edema of the left calf and ankle; the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit was 33.8% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the hemoglobin level 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), and thed-dimer level 2079 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, red-cell indexes, prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, results of renal- and liver-function tests, and a urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin; testing for creatine kinase isoenzymes and troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities that were more marked than those seen on an electrocardiogram obtained 8 months earlier. Noninvasive studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. On the patient\u2019s presentation to the emergency department, computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed after the administration of contrast material, in accordance with a pulmonary-embolism protocol. A right apical soft-tissue lesion (4.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter) that extended into the lateral chest wall was present (Figure 1A). Enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes (up to 1.8 cm in cross-sectional diameter) were also present (Figure 1B), and enlarged bilateral hilar lymph nodes (1.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter) were present without other mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT images of the lower chest and a CT angiogram that included the upper abdomen showed the superior aspect of a large retroperitoneal soft-tissue mass that extended into both kidneys, as well as hydronephrosis of the right kidney (Figure 1C). Abdominal and pelvic CT to further evaluate the mass was recommended. Initial CT Scans.On the patient\u2019s initial presentation, CT scans of the chest were obtained with the administration of contrast material (Panels A, B, and C). A soft-tissue, pleural-based lesion is shown in the right apex (Panel A, arrow), and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy is present (Panel B, arrow). On an image of the lower chest, a large retroperitoneal mass is visible (Panel C, arrows). CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained 3 days later (Panels D and E). Extensive contiguous retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is shown, with attenuation of the renal vasculature, hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and infiltration of the left kidney proximally (Panel D, arrow). The lymphadenopathy extends below the aortic bifurcation and into the small-bowel mesentery (Panel E, arrow). Three days later, the patient was seen by her internist. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 30.8. An enlarged lymph node (1.0 cm in cross-sectional diameter) was detected on palpation under the pectoralis major muscle in the anterior right axilla. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, and differential count were stable. The reticulocyte count was 2.6% (reference range, 0.5 to 2.5), and the blood uric acid level was 7.1 mg per deciliter (422 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 2.3 to 6.6 mg per deciliter [137 to 393 \u03bcmol per liter]). Blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Cytologic examination of the urine revealed reactive transitional cells and neutrophils but no malignant cells. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed 3 days after the patient\u2019s presentation to the emergency department, revealed a massive conglomerate of enlarged lymph nodes; it extended from the level of the celiac axis to below the aortic bifurcation and into the pelvis, and it resulted in marked attenuation of the renal vessels and inferior vena cava, hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and infiltration of soft tissue into the left kidney (Figure 1D). The soft-tissue abnormality extended into the small-bowel mesentery (Figure 1E) and along the pelvic sidewalls. The liver and spleen were normal, as were all the other abdominal organs and the bowel. The next day, the patient was seen by a urologist, and 8 days after that, she was seen by a surgeon, who recommended a retroperitoneal biopsy. Two weeks after her initial presentation, she was seen again by her internist. The patient reported intermittent edema of the left leg with mild pain, dyspnea on exertion, moderate discomfort in the left lower abdomen, and night sweats. On examination, enlarged lymph nodes were detected on palpation under the pectoralis muscles bilaterally, and the left thigh and calf were edematous, without tenderness or tension. Two days later, repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, and the results were unchanged from previous studies. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and white-cell count were stable; blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests were normal.

Seven months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of pain and swelling in the left wrist that had lasted for 3 weeks. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evidence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of prednisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved. Six months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation. Two weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorganisms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative. Four months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quadrant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Figure 1A). Splenomegaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also identified (Figure 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Figure 1D). MRCP Images.Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed with the administration of intravenous contrast material 4 months before the current presentation. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows a periportal hyperintense signal (arrow), hypertrophy of the caudate lobe of the liver, and hepatic surface nodularity. An axial T1-weighted image (Panel B) shows cavernous transformation of the portal vein (arrow). A coronal T1-weighted image (Panel C) shows evidence of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and upper abdominal collateral vessels (arrow). A coronal maximum-intensity-projection image (Panel D) shows mild irregularity of the intrahepatic bile ducts and prominence of the common bile duct (arrow), which measures 8 mm in diameter. Three months before the current evaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esophageal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucinations. The blood ammonia level was 99 \u03bcmol per liter (169 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range, 11 to 60 \u03bcmol per liter [19 to 102 \u03bcg per deciliter]). Urinalysis was normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound images showed persistent splenomegaly and heterogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern consistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge. One month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilatation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress testing showed no evidence of inducible left ventricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation. In the gastroenterology clinic, the patient reported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deciliter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, including intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine\u2013naloxone. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addition to buprenorphine\u2013naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked as a laborer but was disabled and no longer working. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister. On examination, the heart rate was 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Eleven years earlier, a superficial spreading melanoma had been excised from the right lower leg. The patient had been well until approximately 5 weeks before presentation to this hospital, when pain and swelling developed in the right leg and groin. Four weeks before presentation, he was seen in the emergency department at another hospital. Examination revealed a mass in the right groin, with surrounding erythema. A course of cephalexin was administered, with resolution of pain and erythema but persistence of the mass. Computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis reportedly revealed an irregular mass (3.1 cm in diameter) in the right groin. One week later, combination positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (PET-CT) reportedly revealed hypermetabolic lymph nodes involving the right external iliac, femoral, and inguinal regions, and the medial right thigh. Eight days before presentation to this hospital, an ultrasound-guided biopsy of a lymph node in the right groin was performed at the other hospital. Pathological examination showed metastatic melanoma. The patient was referred to the cancer center at this hospital. The patient reported feeling well, with no pain, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, headaches, cough, or dyspnea. He had a history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diverticulitis, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (he had undergone placement of a stent 1 year earlier), and hearing loss. He had a history of extensive sun exposure. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan, clopidogrel, and a multivitamin, as well as acetaminophen and nitroglycerin spray, as needed. He had no known allergies. He lived with his wife and was retired, having previously worked as a landscaper and mechanic. He remained physically active, performing farm work. He had smoked three packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years (stopping 20 years earlier), drank alcohol infrequently, and did not use illicit drugs. His sister had had uterine cancer, and his maternal grandmother had had breast cancer; there was no family history of melanoma. On examination, the blood pressure was 151/87 mm Hg; other vital signs and the oxygen saturation level while the patient was breathing ambient air were normal. Hearing was decreased, and a hearing aide was noted in the right ear. Masses were present in the right groin and right medial thigh, measuring 6 cm and 5 cm in maximal dimension, respectively. There was mild erythema and swelling of the right thigh and a well-healed scar on the right calf. There was no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, submental, occipital, or axillary adenopathy. The blood glucose level was 56 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). A complete blood count, the prothrombin time, and the results of tests of renal and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, total protein, albumin, and globulin. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed enlarged retroperitoneal, pelvic sidewall, and inguinal lymph nodes on the right side, with the largest lymph node (4 cm in diameter) in the right groin (Figure 1A). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed nonspecific changes and no mass lesion. The procedure was terminated before the administration of gadolinium because of claustrophobia. Imaging Studies.A CT image of the abdomen and pelvis on initial evaluation (Panel A) shows a large mass in the right groin (arrow). A repeat CT image obtained 39 weeks after the start of treatment with vemurafenib (Panel B) shows new metastatic lesions in the spine (arrow) and a compression fracture (arrowhead). An image from MRI of the brain shows new enhancing masses consistent with metastasis (Panel C, arrow). During stereotactic radiosurgery for a left frontal metastasis (Panel D), the patient received 1800 cGy to the volume delineated by the green isodose line. An image from a repeat MRI scan obtained 11 months later (Panel E) shows nearly complete resolution of brain lesions (arrow).

Eleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe. Initial Imaging Studies.A chest CT image obtained at the first hospital 5 weeks before the current presentation (Panel A) shows ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe (arrow). A chest radiograph obtained at the second hospital 10 days before the current presentation (Panel B) shows a consolidation in the left lower lobe and an associated moderate-sized pleural effusion (arrow). The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and paliperidone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged home. Ten days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough developed, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the chest (Figure 1B) revealed a consolidation in the left lower lobe and a left pleural effusion. A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home. During the subsequent 6 days, the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough increased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks, and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital. On evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The hemoglobin level was 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the albumin level 1.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.

CT angiography of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed emboli of the right and left pulmonary arteries that extended into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches (Figure 2). There were wedge-shaped opacities without enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side. Imaging Studies Obtained on Current Presentation.A coronal image (Panel A) and an axial image (Panel B) from CT angiography of the chest show large emboli of the central right and left pulmonary arteries (Panels A and B, respectively; arrows) that extend to multiple segmental and subsegmental branches. Small pleural effusions are present in both lungs. An additional axial image (Panel C) shows a wedge-shaped infarct in the left lower lobe (arrow); a similar infarct was also observed in the left upper lobe (not shown). A perfusion image (Panel D) shows heterogeneous perfusion in both lungs (arrowhead) and a lack of perfusion associated with the bilateral pleural effusions and with the infarct in the left lower lobe (arrow). Treatment with enoxaparin, vancomycin, and cefepime was started, and intravenous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain. The patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bipolar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included quetiapine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash, nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt, and paternal uncle had depression. On examination, the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash.

The patient had been well until 7 weeks before this presentation, when progressive pruritus throughout the body developed, along with nausea, bloating, and watery mustard-colored diarrhea. She had eaten sushi for dinner the previous night. She was evaluated in an urgent care clinic in the southeastern United States; she had recently moved there from New England. An injection of methylprednisolone was administered, and hydroxyzine and diphenoxylate\u2013atropine were prescribed. During the next 3 weeks, the symptoms did not abate and jaundice developed, along with new discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, decreased appetite, and amber-colored urine. Four weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital. The alanine aminotransferase level was 327 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase level 104 U per liter (reference range, 1 to 32), and the total bilirubin level 5.8 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.1 to 1.2).

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed a distended gallbladder with sludge, as well as dilated hepatic and pancreatic ducts. The patient was admitted to the local hospital. On the second hospital day, results of liver-function tests improved, and she was discharged home with plans for an outpatient evaluation with a gastroenterologist. However, the next day, the patient flew back to New England and presented to the emergency department of a second hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, she described persistent diffuse pruritus, nausea, right upper abdominal pain, and mustard-colored diarrhea. She also reported fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 3.2 kg during the past month, and poor sleep. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. Aside from her recent move to the southeastern United States and trip back to New England, there was no recent travel. She worked seasonally as an official at sporting events. She smoked cigarettes occasionally, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. Her family history included colon cancer in her maternal grandmother, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandmother; breast cancer in her maternal aunt and paternal aunt; and thyroid cancer in her father. In addition, her maternal grandmother had diabetes, and both grandmothers had coronary artery disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 155/82 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was thin and appeared jaundiced, with scleral icterus. She had diffuse excoriations from scratching. The bowel sounds were normal. There was mild tenderness in the right upper abdomen on palpation, but masses and hepatosplenomegaly were not detected. The remainder of the examination was normal. The alanine aminotransferase level was 85 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 267 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level 6.7 mg per deciliter. The CA 19-9 level was 79 U per milliliter. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The abdominal CT images obtained at the first hospital were reviewed, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. The dilated ducts terminated abruptly in the pancreatic head. There was a hypodense pancreatic mass at the site of duct obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D) also revealed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which narrowed abruptly at the level of the pancreatic head, with a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the site of obstruction. Initial Pancreatic Imaging Studies.A coronal contrast-enhanced CT image (Panel A) shows diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation (white arrow) and pancreatic ductal dilatation (white arrowheads), a finding known as the double-duct sign. An axial contrast-enhanced CT image (Panel B) shows a hypodense region (black arrow) in the pancreatic head and uncinate process, at the site of duct obstruction. A coronal thick-section magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatographic image (Panel C) also shows dilatation of the biliary ducts (white arrow) and pancreatic ducts (white arrowhead), with an abrupt transition of the ducts (black arrow) in the pancreatic head. An axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance image (Panel D) shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass (black arrow) in the region of the pancreatic head. An endoscopic ultrasonographic image (Panel E) shows a hypoechoic mass (black arrow) in the pancreatic head. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture in the bile duct at the level of the mass, and a stent was placed. The bilirubin level initially decreased, but pruritus and diarrhea persisted. By the seventh hospital day, the bilirubin level had increased to 12.6 mg per deciliter and the CA 19-9 level had increased to 959 U per milliliter. Additional diagnostic testing was performed. Endoscopic ultrasonography (Figure 1E) revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic head. Fine-needle aspiration was performed. The aspirate showed variably atypical epithelium, but the quantity and quality of the findings were insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Given the uncertain diagnosis and the possibility of cancer, a surgical consultation was obtained. Surgical removal of the mass was recommended to establish the definitive diagnosis, but the patient declined surgery. Prednisone was administered, and the pruritus and diarrhea abated. On the 20th hospital day, the patient was discharged with plans for an outpatient follow-up evaluation with a gastroenterologist. Three days after discharge from the second hospital, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. At that time, her symptoms had resolved, the results of liver-function tests were normal, and the CA 19-9 level had decreased to 80 U per milliliter. IgG levels (total and subclasses) were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were negative. The possibility of cancer was explained to the patient, and surgical removal of the mass was again recommended, but the patient declined surgery owing to multiple issues related to her work and personal life. A management plan that was acceptable to the patient was adopted during the next 6 months. The patient was closely monitored, and biliary stents were changed when they became occluded.

On the day of admission, the patient was found by emergency medical services personnel, who had been contacted by a neighbor. He was sitting on a mattress, was incontinent of feces and urine, and was surrounded by empty prescription containers for gabapentin and bupropion, along with empty bottles of vodka. He had last been seen by neighbors 4 days earlier, when he reportedly locked himself in his apartment after purchasing alcohol. No other drugs or drug paraphernalia were found. On examination, he was conscious and shaking and did not speak or follow commands. The initial score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 10 (on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels of consciousness). The blood pressure was 236/158 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute. The lungs were clear. Glucometer readings of fingerstick capillary blood specimens reported an error. He required assistance to stand and walk to the stretcher. He was brought by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 216/100 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but unable to give his name, answer questions, or follow commands. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 11 (4 for spontaneous eye opening, 2 for incomprehensible sounds, and 5 for response to pain). The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. No papilledema was present. He was able to track and regard the examiner. The face was symmetric. Cough and gag reflex were present. He moved his limbs spontaneously and against gravity. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, plantar reflexes were flexor bilaterally, and there was no Hoffman\u2019s reflex (a relatively nonspecific sign in which tapping of the nail or flicking of the terminal phalanx of the middle or ring finger leads to flexion of the terminal phalanx of the thumb that can herald upper motor neuron disease). A few beats of ankle clonus were present. The skin was cool and slightly pale, and the remainder of the examination was normal, with no evidence of head trauma or other injury. An electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of coagulation and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase, lactic acid, troponin T, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide; other test results are shown inTable 1. Toxicologic screening of blood and urine was negative. Cultures of blood and urine were obtained. Lactulose was administered through a nasogastric tube, and intravenous normal saline and haloperidol were administered. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material approximately 2.5 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, revealed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular hypodensity, findings suggestive of hydrocephalus related to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. There was also a heterogeneous, partially hyperdense intraventricular lesion involving the ependyma, with a focus in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle measuring approximately 2 cm (Figure 1A) and other components involving the third ventricle. There was no intracranial hemorrhage or large infarction. Imaging Studies.Approximately 2.5 hours after presentation, a CT scan of the head was obtained without the administration of contrast material (Panel A). It shows marked ventriculomegaly and periventricular hypodensity, findings suggestive of acute hydrocephalus. In addition, it shows a heterogeneous lesion, a portion of which is visible in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle (Panel A, arrow) and appears to involve the ependymal lining of the ventricle. Approximately 5 hours after presentation, MRI scans of the head were obtained. Axial T1-weighted images that were obtained before and after the administration of contrast material (Panels B and C, respectively) and a contrast-enhanced coronal image (Panel D) show marked, diffuse enlargement of the lateral ventricles. An enhancing lesion is present that involves the ependyma in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle; it has a nodular component (Panels B and C, arrows), as well as smooth enhancement extending into the third ventricle (Panel D, arrowhead). An axial T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel E) shows the intrinsic T2hyperintensity of the nodular lesion in the left lateral ventricle (arrow), as well as diffuse periventricular T2hyperintensity, a finding that most likely reflects transependymal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid that results from acute hydrocephalus. An apparent diffusion coefficient image (Panel F) shows peripherally restricted diffusion in the nodular lesion (arrow). Approximately 5 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B through 1F). T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed marked enlargement of the lateral ventricles and prominent periventricular hyperintensity that reflected transependymal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a feature consistent with acute hydrocephalus. T1-weighted images revealed enhancing lesions involving the ependyma of the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle that extended toward the foramen of Monro. A smooth and nodular enhancing lesion extended into and partially filled the third ventricle. There was mildly restricted diffusion in the enhancing lesion, including the nodular component in the left lateral ventricle. Given the heterogeneous enhancement, some of which had corresponding restricted diffusion, infection and cancer were the principal diagnostic considerations. A right transfrontal external ventricular drain was placed while the patient was in the trauma bay. The opening pressure was 24 mm Hg (normal value, \u226411). Results of CSF analysis are shown inTable 1. Bacterial and fungal cultures were obtained, and vancomycin was administered. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU). During the next 3 days, one of two sets of blood cultures in aerobic bottles grew gram-positive cocci, which were identified asStaphylococcus saprophyticus,Aerococcus viridans,and probableS. sciuri; repeat cultures were negative, as were cultures of the urine and CSF. Examination of sputum specimens revealed squamous cells and mixed bacteria, with no evidence of acid-fast bacilli. Blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, insulin-like growth factor 1, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, and testing for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, cryptococcal antigens, and IgG antibodies to echinococcus andTaenia solium(which causes cysticercosis) were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Cefepime, folate, thiamine, and cyanocobalamin were administered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver and borderline splenomegaly. A feeding tube was inserted. A tuberculin skin test was negative. An electroencephalogram showed frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity and frequent irregular left hemispheric delta slowing amid diffuse delta\u2013theta background slowing, without evidence of overt electrographic or clinical seizure activity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49%, mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, and no evidence of valvular vegetations. The patient remained afebrile. The transduced intracranial pressure ranged from 7 to 15 mm Hg. On examination, the patient opened his eyes to voice, had dysconjugate gaze, and did not track or follow commands. The pupils were equal and reactive, and he blinked in response to threat. He withdrew his arms and legs from pain and had antigravity strength. The reflexes were symmetric, and plantar reflexes were flexor. A family member was identified and contacted. The next day, patient data from another clinic revealed a history of chronic lower back pain and hepatitis C virus infection, and the patient had had a possible retinal abnormality 1 year earlier. There was no known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or diabetes mellitus. His medications were gabapentin and bupropion. He was allergic to penicillin. He was single, lived alone, had been incarcerated in the past, and had few friends. He smoked cigarettes, drank 1 liter of hard alcohol daily, and reportedly did not use illicit drugs.

The patient had been born in Puerto Rico by induced vaginal delivery after 41 weeks of gestation. Her mother did not smoke, drink alcohol, or take any medications during the pregnancy. Results of prenatal laboratory testing had reportedly suggested maternal hyperthyroidism, but follow-up studies revealed normal thyroid function. The delivery was uncomplicated, and the birth weight was 3.2 kg (50th percentile). The patient\u2019s growth had been assessed as normal until she was 9 months of age, when she attended a clinic visit. The weight was 7.0 kg (10th percentile), which was lower than the weight at the most recent clinic visit, 2 months earlier (7.1 kg [27th percentile]) (Figure 1). Follow-up appointments were scheduled. Growth Charts.Shown are the patient\u2019s growth charts, which include data on body length and weight (Panel A) and head circumference and weight-for-length (Panel B) relative to the percentiles for girls up to 24 months of age. The patient returned to the clinic when she was 12 months of age, and the weight was 7.3 kg (6th percentile). The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, total carnitine, free carnitine, and ammonia; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.025, a pH of 6.0, 2+ leukocyte esterase, and trace blood by dipstick; on microscopic examination, squamous epithelial cells and bacteria were present and there were 2 to 5 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. A urine culture grew very few mixed bacteria. Nutritional shakes were prescribed through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Laboratory Data. When the patient attended a clinic visit 6 weeks later, the weight was 7.7 kg (7th percentile). The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was referred for evaluation by a geneticist, who reportedly did not suspect a genetic cause of poor weight gain. When the patient was 14.5 months of age, she was seen by a nutritionist; a detailed meal plan that was designed to provide a balanced, high-kilocalorie diet was recommended. The results of a sweat chloride test were reportedly normal. One month later, the patient was evaluated by an endocrinologist. Blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, total carnitine, free carnitine, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A radiographic assessment of bone age in the left hand (according to the method of Greulich and Pyle) revealed a bone age of 1 year 6 months, which was within 1 SD of normal. Methimazole was prescribed; the patient\u2019s mother administered the drug for 3 days before stopping because of unspecified side effects. Two weeks later, the patient was seen by a second endocrinologist. The patient\u2019s mother reported that the child was an active toddler and that she had a strong appetite and ate a wide variety of foods throughout the day; however, she had not gained weight despite following the meal plan recommended by the nutritionist. On examination, the patient was thin, with wasting of the buttocks. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and the external female genitalia were classified as Tanner stage 1 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). A glucometer and test strips were provided to the mother, with instructions to record the fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels. Ten days after this clinic visit, tests for thyrotropin-receptor antibodies and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Results of ultrasonography of the thyroid gland, which was performed 3 days later, were normal. At a follow-up visit in the endocrinology clinic when the patient was 17 months of age, the weight was 7.6 kg (<2nd percentile). Tests for antithyroglobulin antibodies, anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies, and antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies were negative, and blood levels of phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, thyroid peroxidase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The endocrinologist recommended that the patient be evaluated in a multidisciplinary, coordinated pediatric-care system in the continental United States, and the patient and her mother relocated to New England the following month. When the patient was 19 months of age, she was seen in a pediatric clinic and directly admitted to the inpatient pediatric unit of a community hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation of failure to thrive. On admission, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the child ate large amounts of food (equal to the amounts eaten by her 5-year-old brother) and never seemed satisfied. The patient had no abdominal pain or diarrhea. When she was between 10 and 12 months of age, she had begun to vomit intermittently. Nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred approximately once per week thereafter; the mother attributed the vomiting to overeating. The patient had briefly been hospitalized during infancy for influenza and at 16 months of age for bronchiolitis. She had crawled at 7 months of age, cruised at 10 months of age, and walked at 12 months of age. She walked up steps with assistance, ran, spoke eight words, pointed to indicate wants, and scribbled spontaneously. The mother described the child as happy and playful and reported that she behaved as though she were healthy. The timing of dental eruption had been normal. The patient received no medications, had no known allergies, and had received routine childhood vaccinations. Since she had moved from Puerto Rico 1 month earlier, she had been living with her mother, 5-year-old brother, and step-grandmother in an urban area of New England. The patient\u2019s mother was healthy, her brother had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, and her father\u2019s medical history was unknown. On examination, the patient had cachexia; she otherwise appeared well and happy, was playful and active, and walked rapidly around the hospital room. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.4 kg (<1st percentile). The anterior fontanelle was closed, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The next day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 7.3 kg (<1st percentile); the results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, red-cell indexes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and C-reactive protein; other test results are shown inTable 1.

Three years before this admission, the patient had been seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of neck pain. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed evidence of degenerative disk disease of the cervical spine and a pulmonary nodule (8 mm in diameter) in the left upper lobe. Three months after that initial visit, follow-up CT of the chest was performed, and the nodule in the left upper lobe had not changed in size. Five months after the initial visit, combined18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT (FDG-PET\u2013CT) revealed that the pulmonary nodule had increased in size to 1 cm in diameter, was tethered to the overlying pleura in the left upper lobe, and had increased FDG uptake; a contiguous nodule (7 mm in diameter) with increased FDG uptake and new nodules in the right middle lobe were also present. In addition, there was intense diffuse FDG uptake in the stomach, as well as wall thickening of the most distal aspect of the terminal ileum and the cecum in the region of the ileocecal valve, with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding (Figure 1). Positron-Emission Tomographic and CT Scans.An18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron-emission tomographic (FDG-PET) scan (Panel A) shows increased FDG uptake in a nodule in the left upper lobe (arrowhead) and in the region of the ileocecal valve (arrow). A corresponding axial CT scan (Panel B) shows a 1-cm nodule in the left upper lobe (arrowhead). A corresponding coronal CT scan (Panel C) shows wall thickening of the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve (arrow) and adjacent fat stranding, as well as an infrarenal aortic aneurysm (asterisk). Lung biopsy, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy were recommended, but the patient declined to undergo these procedures. Approximately 9 months after the initial visit, induration (8 mm in diameter) developed at the site of a tuberculin skin test that had been performed during a hemodialysis appointment at an outpatient care unit. Chest radiography was performed; pulmonary lesions were not noted. Eleven months after the initial visit (25 months before this admission), severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant and pain in the right flank developed acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. Imaging studies were obtained. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 2A), revealed a hematoma in the right anterior pararenal space that arose from a subcapsular hematoma in the right kidney, with extravasation of blood into the retroperitoneal space. In addition, the soft-tissue mass at the ileocecal junction had increased in size. Serial CT Scans Obtained over a 30-Month Period.Coronal CT scans that were obtained over a 30-month period (Panels A through E) show persistent thickening of the terminal ileum and ileocecal valve (arrows in all panels) and adjacent fat stranding. There is high-attenuation fluid in the retroperitoneum (Panel A, asterisk), a finding consistent with hemorrhage due to a right renal subcapsular hematoma (not shown). There is also an infrarenal aortic aneurysm (Panel B, asterisk), which shows endovascular repair on follow-up images (Panels C and D). The patient was admitted to the hospital, and coil embolization of the right renal artery was performed. On the fourth hospital day, a colonoscopy was performed, and a nonobstructive fungating mass (4 cm by 2 cm) was visualized at the ileocecal valve (Figure 3). Examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass showed severely active chronic colitis with fibrinopurulent exudate. On the 11th hospital day, colonoscopy was repeated and upper endoscopy was performed. In addition to the ileocecal mass, there were a few small inflammatory nodules with a patchy distribution in the lower two thirds of the esophagus, an oozing cratered ulcer in the gastric body with a visible vessel that was clipped, a few nonbleeding superficial ulcers in the gastric antrum, and diffuse, moderately erythematous mucosa in the duodenal bulb. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed erosive gastritis with reactive foveolar hyperplasia and markedly active chronic ileitis and ileocolitis with ulceration and nonnecrotizing granulomas; no fungal forms or acid-fast bacilli were seen. The patient was discharged home while taking omeprazole. Colonoscopic Image.An initial colonoscopy was performed approximately 25 months before the current admission. A nonobstructive fungating mass (4 cm by 2 cm) was visualized at the ileocecal valve. (Photograph courtesy of Drs. Ruma Rajbhandari and Braden Kuo.) Eight weeks after that discharge (approximately 23 months before this admission), the patient was seen in the gastroenterology clinic at this hospital. He reported having two or three bowel movements each day, with formed stools and without blood or pain during defecation. He had a reduced appetite but no abdominal pain. The weight was 65.3 kg (decreased from 78.0 kg 3 years earlier), and the abdominal examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 67 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), and the C-reactive protein level was 55.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The dose of omeprazole was increased. Approximately 19 months before this admission, 2 weeks after the patient was discharged from a hospital stay for pacemaker placement, he was seen in the primary care clinic with a 5-day history of diarrhea, lower abdominal pain, and tenderness. The weight was 59.3 kg. A stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens, and a test forClostridium difficilewas positive. A 10-day course of oral metronidazole was prescribed; the frequency of diarrhea initially decreased but returned to three or four times a day after the medication was stopped. A 14-day course of oral vancomycin was prescribed, and the symptoms abated. Sixteen months before this admission, severe abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant developed acutely, and the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital. He reported feeling weak; the right lower quadrant was tender on palpation. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed persistent irregular wall thickening of the terminal ileum, with mild adjacent inflammatory fat stranding (Figure 2B). Hemodialysis was performed, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were administered, and the abdominal pain improved during the next 3 days. A stool culture and examinations for ova and parasites were negative, and a test forC. difficilewas positive; ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for a 14-day course of oral metronidazole. Thirteen months before this admission, the patient returned to the gastroenterology clinic. He reported that he had had three or four loose, nonbloody bowel movements each day for several weeks, with associated generalized abdominal pain. His appetite continued to be reduced, and he felt weak and fatigued. The weight was 55.8 kg, and the abdominal examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis had been performed 2 days before this visit to the gastroenterology clinic, during routine follow-up after a recent endovascular procedure for the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The imaging studies revealed an increase in the circumferential wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum (Figure 2C). A diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease was considered. Treatment with prednisone and methotrexate was recommended, but the patient declined the treatment. Eleven weeks before this admission, generalized weakness, diffuse abdominal discomfort and tenderness, and hypotension developed during an outpatient hemodialysis session. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and fever (to a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C) developed. Cefepime and vancomycin were administered intravenously. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed increased diffuse wall thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, with persistent mesenteric fat stranding and lymphadenopathy (Figure 2D). By the third hospital day, the fever had resolved and the abdominal pain had improved but diarrhea had developed; a test forC. difficilewas again positive. Cefepime and vancomycin were discontinued. The patient was discharged home with prescriptions for budesonide, a 4-week course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and a 6-week tapering course of oral vancomycin. Three and a half weeks before this admission, the patient underwent endarterectomies of the right common femoral artery and the right superficial femoral artery at this hospital. Diarrhea and tenderness of the right lower quadrant developed postoperatively. The patient was uncertain whether he had been taking the budesonide and oral vancomycin that had been prescribed during his most recent hospitalization. Urinalysis revealed cloudy urine with 3+ leukocyte esterase, 3+ occult blood, 2+ albumin, and negative nitrites by dipstick, as well as more than 100 white cells and 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field.

The patient had been well until 2 years before this presentation, when anemia was noted on routine examination at another hospital. During the next 7 months, endoscopic and colonoscopic screening examinations were negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and aspirate revealed 30% plasma cells; flow-cytometric studies revealed an IgG lambda M component. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was made. Skeletal radiographs reportedly revealed multiple lytic lesions. Lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone were administered, followed by cyclophosphamide. Nine months before this presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital; melphalan hydrochloride was administered, and autologous stem-cell transplantation was performed. Results of follow-up studies were consistent with complete remission. Three months before this presentation, the patient was seen by an orthopedist at this hospital for evaluation of low-back pain of 1 year\u2019s duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed multilevel degenerative changes, multiple enhancing lesions in the lumbar spine and left iliac bone, and compression fractures of the first and second lumbar vertebrae, findings consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. Two months before this presentation, swelling and pain in the hands occurred, followed by pedal edema, tightening of the skin of the hands and feet, and diffuse hyperpigmentation on the trunk, arms, and legs. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide was begun, but it was stopped during the first cycle because of worsening symptoms. Diffuse joint pain occurred and hyperpigmentation increased. One month before this presentation, on evaluation in the outpatient cancer center of this hospital, the red-cell indexes and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, thyrotropin, iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and folate; other test results are shown inTable 1. Total urine protein was 90 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 135). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells or amyloid. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid insufficiency, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 64% and showed that the ascending aorta was 41 mm in diameter (reference diameter, <36 mm); there was no evidence of amyloid or pericardial effusion. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory Data. On presentation, the patient rated the joint pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had hyperlipidemia, hypertension, low-back pain, and gastroesophageal reflux disease; he had undergone colonic polypectomies and had a history of prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy was performed 11 years earlier. Medications included acyclovir, rosuvastatin, and omeprazole. Allopurinol caused a rash. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He had stopped smoking 20 years earlier, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and maternal uncle had rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/63 mm Hg and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were normal. A systolic murmur, grade 2/6, was heard at the right and left upper sternal borders. There was swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally and swelling below the knees to the toes, without erythema or warmth. The range of motion was decreased in the metacarpophalangeal and ankle joints. The skin on the metacarpophalangeal joints and legs below the knees to the toes was hyperpigmented. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 54.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); testing for antibodies to Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Sm, RNP, Jo-1, Scl-70 (topoisomerase I), and cyclic citrullinated peptide was negative, and the level of creatine kinase was normal. A tapering course of prednisone was administered. Five weeks later, after returning from a vacation in Aruba, the patient was seen for follow-up appointments at the hematology clinic of the other hospital and the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. He reported severe fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, and weight loss of approximately 3.5 kg. He rated the joint pain at 2 out of 10, but substantial stiffness persisted while he was taking prednisone. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 100 to 111 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air; the temperature was normal. The metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints remained swollen but were less tender, and the wrists were slightly full. There was 1+ pitting edema below the knees; the skin was deeply tanned and firm in a manner that was out of proportion to the degree of pitting edema. Test results are shown inTable 1. The stool was dark brown and positive (3+) for blood. The administration of omeprazole was increased to twice daily, and an endoscopic examination was scheduled. One week later (six weeks after this presentation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening anemia (Table 1). The hematocrit rose to 27.9% after leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. Endoscopy revealed severe acute gastritis with marked erythema and friability. He was discharged on the third day. During the next 2 months, melena and anemia persisted. Colonoscopy at the other hospital revealed a benign polyp, 5 mm in diameter, which was excised. Multiple units of red cells were transfused, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered monthly, with some improvement in joint pain and stiffness. Skin tightness persisted, and a skin biopsy was performed. Examination of histologic sections of a punch-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a fibrosing dermopathy, with interstitial mucin deposition and collagen expansion of the dermis extending to the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 1A). The epidermis appeared normal. Adnexal atrophy with loss of surrounding fat was identified. A sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat (Figure 1B). There were areas of marked fibroblast hypocellularity in the middle and deep reticular dermis, with diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells (Figure 1C). A colloidal iron stain revealed finely granular mucin deposits interspersed between dermal collagen bundles (Figure 1D). An elastic-tissue stain revealed preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with straightening and parallel arrangement (Figure 1E). Skin-Biopsy Specimen.Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histologic sections of a skin-biopsy specimen from the dorsum of the left hand revealed a normal epidermis with dermal collagen expansion involving the subcutaneous tissue (Panel A, asterisk); there is adnexal atrophy with periadnexal fat loss (Panel A, arrow). A sparse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was identified at the junction of the dermis and the subcutaneous fat (Panel B, arrow). There were areas of reticular dermal fibroblast hypocellularity (Panel C). An immunohistochemical stain for CD34 shows a diffuse loss of CD34 expression in dermal spindle cells (Panel C, inset). A colloidal iron stain shows interstitial mucin deposits (Panel D). An elastic-tissue stain shows preservation of dermal elastic fibers, with parallel arrangement and straightening (Panel E, arrow). Three months after this presentation, prednisone was administered for persistent stiffness. The patient reported extreme fatigue and increasing dyspnea on exertion during the preceding 3 months. Results of tests performed at the other hospital are shown inTable 1. Chest imaging was performed because of the worsening shortness of breath. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed reticulation in the subpleural region at the lung bases and bronchiolectasis (Figure 2A). There was no evidence of pulmonary edema. These findings were suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Soft-tissue windows showed a small pleural effusion on the right side and minimal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery that could be correlated with pulmonary hypertension (Figure 2B). The esophagus was diffusely dilated and contained contrast material throughout. A representative sagittal image showed generalized osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions throughout the spine and ribs, and multiple healed fractures, including one in the sternum (Figure 2C). These skeletal findings were consistent with the history of multiple myeloma. CT Scans of the Chest.A CT scan of the chest with lung windows, obtained through the lung bases with the patient in the prone position, shows subpleural reticulation, ground-glass opacities, and bronchiolectasis (Panel A). A scan with soft-tissue windows, obtained with the patient in the supine position, shows a small pleural effusion on the right side, diffuse distention of the esophagus with air and liquid, and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (measuring 3.5 cm in diameter) (Panel B). A scan with bone windows, obtained in the sagittal plane, shows diffuse osteopenia, multiple lytic lesions in the spine, and a healed fracture of the body of the sternum (Panel C). The patient was admitted to this hospital 3.5 months after this presentation. On examination, there were bilateral bronchial breath sounds, crackles at the base of the left lung, extensive hardening of the skin from the hands to the elbows and from the toes to above the knees, and deep bronze discoloration on the trunk, arms, and legs. Joint motion was limited by skin thickening. Test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until 4 years before this presentation, when abdominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated. Three years before this presentation, treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue. Seven months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and urinary levels of cortisol. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a pituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of corticotropin secretion. Treatment with octreotide was discontinued, and 3 months before this presentation, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation. After the second surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged, the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was again elevated, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated. Ten days before this presentation, the patient began to have confusion, urinary incontinence, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors, such as online shopping and excessive eating. MRI of the head revealed a small focus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or residual adenoma. A morning blood level of cortisol was 80 \u03bcg per deciliter (2207 nmol per liter; reference range, 4 to 23 \u03bcg per deciliter [110 to 635 nmol per liter]), and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter (114 pmol per liter; reference range, 7.2 to 63 pg per milliliter [1.6 to 14 pmol per liter]). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 \u03bcg (26,069 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.5 to 45 \u03bcg [10 to 124 nmol per liter]). MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broadly abutted the left adrenal gland, thickening of both adrenal glands, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Treatment with pasireotide was discontinued, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated, in addition to potassium supplementation and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported fatigue but no fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symptoms; and no history of dysphagia or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites, as well as hypothyroidism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesions. Medications included atovaquone, cholecalciferol, desmopressin, ketoconazole, levothyroxine, metformin, pantoprazole, spironolactone, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked marijuana occasionally. She lived with her husband in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests forMycobacterium tuberculosisowing to her work in the health care setting, and none had been positive. Before her illness, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded, and acne and hair thinning were present. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an implanted venous access device and a patchy opacity in the right upper lung zone. Treatment with octreotide was reinitiated, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secretion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalectomy was planned, but on the second hospital day, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak, take any oral medications, or consume any food. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 \u03bcg per deciliter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lorazepam resulted in marked improvement in the patient\u2019s mental status such that she was following commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated postoperatively, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care. On the eighth hospital day, sinus tachycardia developed. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Figure 1), revealed a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review, clinical notes indicated that positron-emission tomography\u2013CT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter. CT of the Chest.CT images of the chest, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panels A through D), show a patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe with areas of cavitation (Panels A, C, and D, black arrows) and associated tree-in-bud opacities (Panel A, black arrowheads), as well as small bilateral pleural effusions (Panels B, C, and D, white arrows). The axial, coronal, and sagittal images shown in Panels A, C, and D, respectively, were obtained with lung windows, and the axial image shown in Panel B was obtained with soft-tissue windows. A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests forLegionella pneumophilaandStreptococcus pneumoniaeantigens were negative, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60), and the blood galactomannan index was 0.05 (reference range, 0 to 0.49).

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. On the ninth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed; bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) samples were obtained, and no purulent secretions were observed. Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and no organisms were seen on an acid-fast bacilli smear or on a modified acid-fast bacilli smear. Examination of the BAL fluid forPneumocystis jiroveciiwas negative. On the 11th hospital day, culture of the BAL fluid showed growth of few methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureusorganisms.

Seven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter]), a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter]), and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepatosplenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Splenomegaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion. After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to 2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. A bone marrow biopsy performed 2 weeks later at the first hospital revealed hypercellular marrow and multiple nonnecrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were obtained. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started. One month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Three months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pulmonary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneumocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary function showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a bronchodilator, and moderate restriction, with moderately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. During the next 2 months, intermittent confusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing. The patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral methotrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis. Eleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neurologic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weakness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion. Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intracardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonography did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper motor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leukopenia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started. On the fourth hospital day, a fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initiated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen.

The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient\u2019s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords. The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time \u2014 including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes \u2014 was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation. One week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell \u201cworld\u201d backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffusely scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal enhancement. In addition, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages. Lumbar puncture was also performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with a lymphocyte count of 99% (reference range, 40 to 80), the red-cell count was 35 per microliter (reference value, 0), and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter (reference range, 13 to 40); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test forBorrelia burgdorferiwere interpreted as negative. Over the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache persisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient\u2019s husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requiring assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain. The patient had a history of poliomyelitis in childhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vitamin B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with an unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 62 years of age. On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Strength was 5/5 throughout, except in the left leg (4/5). Reflexes were brisk throughout, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examinations for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. MRI of the head was performed (Figure 1). FLAIR images showed slight progression of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensities and leptomeningeal enhancement. Susceptibility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. MRI of the Head.A T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) shows abnormal diffuse sulcal hyperintensity (arrowheads). A T1-weighted image obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel B) shows abnormal diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement (arrowheads). A susceptibility-weighted image (Panel C) shows abnormal sulcal hypointensity in multiple locations (arrowheads). Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), the lymphocyte count 85%, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An EEG was normal. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours, the patient was agitated and impulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells.

The patient had a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, acne, depression, and drug dependency. She had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when insomnia developed, which she attributed to her loss of a prescription for zolpidem. During the 10 days before this presentation, she reported seeing white \u201cgranular balls,\u201d which she thought were mites or larvae, emerging from and crawling on her skin, sheets, and clothing and in her feces, apartment, and car, as well as having an associated pruritic rash. She was seen by her physician, who referred her to a dermatologist for consideration of other possible causes of the persistent rash, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, which is associated with HCV infection. Three days before this presentation, the patient ran out of clonazepam (after an undefined period during which she reportedly took more than the prescribed dose) and had increasing anxiety and insomnia. The same day, she reported seeing \u201cbugs\u201d on her 15-month-old son that were emerging from his scalp and were present on his skin and in his diaper and sputum. The patient scratched her skin and her child\u2019s skin to remove the offending agents. The day before this presentation, she called emergency medical services and she and her child were transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital. A diagnosis of possible cheyletiellosis was made. She was advised to use selenium sulfide shampoo and to follow up with her physician; the patient returned home with her child. On the morning of admission, while bathing her child, she noted that his scalp was turning red and he was crying. She came with her son to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient reported the presence of bugs on her skin, which she attempted to point out to examiners. She acknowledged a habit of picking at her skin since adolescence, which she said had a calming effect. Fourteen months earlier, shortly after the birth of her son, worsening acne developed that did not respond to treatment with topical antimicrobial agents and tretinoin. Four months later, a facial abscess due to methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) was successfully treated with oral trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The patient\u2019s son had had a MRSA-related skin infection, and after antibiotic treatment,Clostridium difficilecolitis developed, which required hospitalization. The patient reported a history of major depression (now in remission) but reported having no symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions, during the periods of depression. She was dependent on sedative\u2013hypnotic medications and opiates and occasionally used illicit amphetamine salts; she reported having taken 60 mg of amphetamine salts in recent days. A diagnosis of HCV infection had been made 2 years earlier. She had had diverticulitis and nephrolithiasis, and 4 years earlier, she had a perforated duodenal ulcer that required surgical repair. Medications included buprenorphine and naloxone in combination (8 mg sublingually twice daily, although 20 mg daily was prescribed), sertraline (150 mg daily, until it ran out 2 days earlier), clonazepam (0.5 mg three times daily, until it ran out 3 days earlier), and omeprazole. She had no known allergies. She did not drink alcohol. She had injected oxycodone in the past but reported no opioid use since the birth of her child. She lived with her son, had been unemployed for 2 years, and received transitional food assistance (i.e., food stamps). Her maternal aunt had schizophrenia, and her mother had attempted suicide during the patient\u2019s childhood. On examination, the patient was cooperative, anxious, and disheveled and indicated affected areas of skin to caregivers. The blood pressure was 141/95 mm Hg, and the pulse 100 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. She was fully oriented. There were excoriations on her face, arms, and legs, but the midback was spared. The remainder of the general examination was normal. On mental-status examination, the patient was irritable and somewhat hostile toward a female interviewer but pleasant and cooperative with a male interviewer. She was convinced that she had a parasitic infestation and thought she might have Morgellons (a condition in which patients describe inorganic material such as fibers emerging from the skin in combination with cutaneous sensations), which she had read about on the Internet. She pleaded with examiners for their help and belief in her concerns. Her thought process was perseverative and occasionally tangential. She intermittently scratched herself. She reported no neurovegetative symptoms of depression other than insomnia. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.9 mg per deciliter (0.61 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.84 to 1.45 mmol per liter]), and the blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 43 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32). The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, vitamin B12, folate, thyrotropin, and albumin, as well as the results of other tests of liver function. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 3+ occult blood by dipstick, mucin, and 5 to 10 red cells, 0 to 2 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field. A urinary test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative, and screening for toxins was positive for amphetamines.

The symptoms improved when he rolled into the supine position, and he slept until 7 a.m.; on awakening, the symptoms recurred. When walking, he sensed he was tilting to the left but did not fall. The symptoms worsened throughout the morning; they were most severe with head movements and were associated with increasing nausea and, after 10 a.m., vomiting. He called his doctor's office because of concern that he was having a stroke. He was advised to go the hospital and called emergency medical services.

He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital, arriving approximately 9 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient reported facial tingling in the area surrounding the eyes, including the malar eminence, and a mild headache. He noted that his visual perception momentarily lagged behind his eye movements, and the lag was more severe when looking to the right than to the left. He had no diplopia, blurred vision, tinnitus, decreased hearing, difficulty swallowing, changes in sensation or strength, palpitations, chest pain, fever, or shortness of breath. He reported an episode of self-limited positional vertigo that had occurred several years earlier. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, sleep apnea (for which he intermittently used continuous positive airway pressure at night), depression, meralgia paresthetica (a painful mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), erectile dysfunction, and recurrent localized herpes simplex virus infection. He was left-handed. His daily medications included rosuvastatin, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, duloxetine, aspirin, and a multivitamin. He also received, as needed, a topical lidocaine patch for meralgia paresthetica; gabapentin for pain; vardenafil (though he had not taken it recently); fluticasone propionate nasal spray and inhaler, albuterol, and loratadine for wheezing and asthma; and valacyclovir. He swam regularly, drank wine daily, and did not smoke. His siblings had arthritis and hypercholesterolemia, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The skin was pale and diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 123/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 58 beats per minute; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The sensation of light touch was slightly decreased over the malar eminence and the jaw on the left side and was normal over the eyelids, frontalis muscle, and upper neck. There was nystagmus on left lateral gaze, and sustaining left lateral gaze required some effort; the eye movements were slower from midline to the left than from midline to the right. He was able to reproduce the sensation of delayed visual return, which was more severe when moving his head to the right than to the left. When he was not supported, he tilted to the left. He walked cautiously and slowly, with a slightly broad-based gait, and was unable to perform tandem walking. Deep-tendon reflexes were slightly more brisk on the right side than on the left side. The remainder of the neurologic and general examinations was normal. The blood level of carbon dioxide was 21.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), the level of glucose was 164 mg per deciliter (9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]), the level of phosphorus was 1.2 mg per deciliter (0.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]), and the anion gap was 16 mmol per liter (reference range, 3 to 15). Blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium were normal, as were results of the complete blood count and tests of coagulation, renal function, and liver function; screening for troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 beats per minute and no acute ischemic changes. Lorazepam, ondansetron, and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient's condition partially improved. Approximately 2 hours after the patient's arrival, computed tomography (CT) of the brain, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed normal brain parenchyma and an extraaxial calcified lesion, 9 mm by 16 mm by 6 mm, in the left parafalcine area over the high parietal convexity; there was no intracranial hemorrhage, extraaxial collection, mass effect, or midline shift.

The patient had been generally well until she was 4 years of age, when occasional episodes of abdominal pain began to occur. These episodes, which occurred a few times per year and were separated by asymptomatic periods, were sometimes associated with constipation or nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. Neither fevers nor diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s family reported the symptoms during routine annual examinations or other scheduled or urgent appointments at a health center affiliated with this hospital. Polyethylene glycol was administered intermittently for constipation, with improvement. When the patient was 8 years of age, a sudden episode of sharp pain on the left side of the chest occurred, with associated tachycardia and nausea, in the absence of precipitating factors. On examination at school, the pulse was 150 beats per minute; at the health center, the temperature and the remainder of the physical examination were normal, as were a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. The patient returned home. Results of a cardiologic evaluation that was performed 2 months later were normal. During the next 18 months, the episodes of abdominal pain became more frequent (up to three or four times weekly) and occurred more often when the patient was at school than during weekends. The pain was typically epigastric and associated with vomiting. On evaluation when the patient was 8 years 7 months of age, a urine culture was sterile, serologic testing forHelicobacter pyloriinfection was negative, and an abdominal radiograph showed no evidence of obstruction. Polyethylene glycol and omeprazole were administered; the constipation transiently diminished when the medications were taken regularly. When the patient was 9 years 4 months of age, she was seen at an urgent care clinic because of sharp, crampy epigastric pain. Examination revealed a normal temperature, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, fullness in the left lower quadrant that was consistent with the presence of stool, and no abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness. Therapy with the laxative was resumed, and constipation diminished; however, abdominal pain recurred intermittently thereafter, along with vomiting, which gave partial pain relief. One month later, a physical examination was normal. A complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, free thyroxine, and thyrotropin and results of renal- and liver-function tests; testing forH. pyloriinfection and celiac disease was negative. Abdominal radiography was performed. The abdominal radiograph (Figure 1) showed a nonobstructive bowel-gas pattern and a moderate-to-abundant amount of stool distributed in the colon, particularly in the ascending colon; these findings are consistent with the clinical history of constipation. There was a normal distribution of bowel gas and no evidence of abnormal mass effect or intraabdominal calcifications. Abdominal Radiograph.An abdominal radiograph shows a moderate-to-abundant amount of stool in the ascending colon, a finding suggestive of constipation. Therapy with omeprazole was initiated. The patient was referred to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. The patient and her family reported that the sharp, intermittent epigastric pain was sometimes associated with and partly relieved by nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and was not associated with or relieved by defecation. The patient had chronic constipation; the stools were hard and passed with straining, without blood, mucus, grease, tenesmus, urgency, cramping, or diarrhea. Constipation had resolved with the regular administration of polyethylene glycol and lactulose, and epigastric pain had diminished with omeprazole therapy. The patient had a history of asthma and had had pneumonia at 2 years of age. She had no mouth sores, fevers, or joint pains. Her growth was normal. She had no known allergies. Her diet was relatively low in fiber, with few vegetables and fruits. She lived with her parents and attended school; she was an excellent student. She was of South American ancestry and had traveled to South America when she was 8 years of age. Her father had gastroesophageal reflux disease, a sister had hyperthyroidism, and her maternal grandmother and aunts had migraines; there was no family history of celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, or the irritable bowel syndrome. On examination, the patient had a shy and somewhat anxious demeanor. The blood pressure was normal, the height 130.3 cm (19th percentile), and the weight 28.6 kg (28th percentile). The epigastrium was tender, without abdominal guarding, rebound tenderness, or stool loading; the remainder of the examination was normal. Analysis of the stool forH. pyloriantigen was negative. Omeprazole therapy was stopped after a 2-month course. At a follow-up visit in the gastroenterology clinic 6 weeks after the initial visit, the patient and her family reported that the epigastric pain had recurred approximately weekly, despite the omeprazole therapy; the pain was associated with vomiting and appeared to be unrelated to stress or defecation. The patient passed stools once or twice per day that were formed, with mucus and without blood. She had no nocturnal pain, headaches, or morning nausea. On examination, there was epigastric tenderness just beneath the xiphoid process; the abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender, with no mass in the left lower quadrant to suggest stool loading. The remainder of the examination was normal. One month later, an abdominal ultrasound image was normal. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed; although there was suspicion for duodenitis, pathological examination of biopsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, globulin, amylase, and lipase and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. All medications were discontinued. A diagnosis of abdominal migraine was considered, and the patient was referred to a neurologist; an appointment was scheduled for 4 months later. During the next 2 months, the frequency of abdominal pain increased, and the patient began to have \u201cfits of pain\u201d at school and at home, during which she was pale, had diaphoresis, and fell on the floor. Her symptoms partially improved when she bent over and held her abdomen. Results of an examination by her pediatrician were unchanged. Therapy with omeprazole and polyethylene glycol was reinitiated, and amitriptyline therapy for abdominal migraine was begun. At 9 years 11 months of age, an episode of unrelenting severe abdominal pain occurred that began in the left upper and left lower quadrants and radiated to the back. On the third day of the episode, the patient was seen by her pediatrician at the health center. The examination was normal; the abdomen was soft and nontender. There was a lack of response to the initial dosage of amitriptyline, so the dosage was increased. The patient was referred to a mental health consultant for instruction regarding biofeedback and relaxation techniques.

Six years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated because of melena and anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal ulcers; biopsy of one of the ulcers revealed changes consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a locally invasive mass in the head of the pancreas. A diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the duodenum was made, and treatment included chemotherapy, chemoradiation, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Two months after the surgery, surveillance CT of the chest showed segmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended, but the patient declined. During the next 5 years, surveillance CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 6 months. Six months before the current presentation, CT of the abdomen showed a new mass in the sigmoid colon with associated nodularity and lymphadenopathy. Colonoscopy revealed two fungating, nonobstructing, medium-sized masses, one at the ileocecal valve and the other in the sigmoid colon. Biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of mantle-cell lymphoma was established. The patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital, and plans were made for treatment with chemotherapy. Five months before the current presentation, pain in the right leg developed after a long car trip. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Nine weeks before the current presentation, cycle 1 of rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) chemotherapy was administered, along with filgrastim. In addition, the administration of acyclovir and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was started for prophylaxis; however, rash developed on the trunk after 1 week, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was replaced with atovaquone for prophylaxis againstPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia. Six weeks before the current presentation, cycle 2 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Two days later, melena, fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Laboratory testing revealed anemia (hematocrit, 26.8%; normal range, 41.0 to 53.0). The patient received 2 units of packed red cells, and fatigue and dyspnea resolved. Treatment with omeprazole was initiated. Four weeks before the current presentation, the administration of atovaquone was stopped because of the cost of the medication, and dapsone was started for prophylaxis againstP. jiroveciipneumonia. Three weeks before the current presentation, cycle 3 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was administered. Ultrasonography of the right leg revealed resolution of the distal deep-vein thrombosis, and treatment with apixaban was stopped. Two weeks before the current presentation, fatigue and dyspnea on exertion recurred, but melena did not. Laboratory testing again revealed anemia (hematocrit, 28.7%), and the patient received 1 unit of packed red cells; fatigue resolved, but dyspnea did not. On the day of presentation, the patient was evaluated before the administration of cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy. He reported ongoing dyspnea on exertion but no cough, fever, chills, chest pain, or orthopnea. He had been having loose stools since the pancreaticoduodenectomy. Other medical history included hypertension and hereditary spherocytosis, which had been treated with splenectomy. Medications included acyclovir, dapsone, lisinopril, and omeprazole. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole had caused a rash; there were no other known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol rarely; he had smoked tobacco for 2 years but had quit 20 years before this presentation. He was divorced, lived alone in a suburb of Boston, and worked as a lawyer. His mother had had breast cancer. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 92% while the patient was at rest and breathing ambient air, 88 to 90% while he was walking and breathing ambient air, and 93% while he was at rest and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. The patient had tachypnea but no increased work of breathing. The lung sounds were normal, and the jugular venous pulse was not elevated. The legs had no edema. The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of coagulation, kidney-function, and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA was negative, as was a respiratory viral panel. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. CT pulmonary angiography of the chest (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed filling defects in the right upper lobe and both lower lobes, findings consistent with pulmonary emboli. Subtle tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities were present in the upper lobes. Scattered pulmonary nodules were present bilaterally; they were stable in size as compared with nodules observed on previous imaging studies. The main pulmonary artery measured 2.6 cm in diameter proximal to bifurcation. CT Pulmonary Angiogram Obtained on Presentation.Mild tree-in-bud and ground-glass opacities are present in the upper lobes (Panel A, circled), findings that are probably indicative of inflammatory changes. Small filling defects are present in subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the right upper lobe (Panel B, arrow) and both lower lobes (Panel C, arrows), findings that are consistent with pulmonary emboli. The heart (Panel C) and pulmonary artery (Panel D) are normal, with no radiologic evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. Cycle 4 of R-DHAP chemotherapy was delayed.

The patient had been in her usual health until 2 weeks before admission, when neck pain developed. Eleven days before admission, she was seen in the emergency department and the labor and delivery unit because of neck and back pain, occipital headache, vomiting, and a self-reported temperature of 38.9\u00b0C. On examination, the back was tender; the vital signs and remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, cloudy urine, with trace ketones, 1+ albumin, and 2+ urobilinogen; urine sediment showed a few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin. Hydromorphone and cyclobenzaprine were administered, with some improvement. The patient was discharged home. A urine culture grew abundant mixed bacteria, with small amounts of two potential pathogens. The headache improved spontaneously after 3 days. Laboratory Data. On the day of presentation, the patient felt the onset of a panic attack followed by tunnel vision; she began to hyperventilate and her vision went black from the periphery to the center. The symptoms lasted for approximately 2 minutes and were followed by spots in her visual fields, headache, neck pain that radiated to her arms, nausea, and dizziness (both unsteadiness and vertigo). The capillary glucose level, which was obtained by the patient, was 122 mg per deciliter (6.8 mmol per liter). She called her caregivers and was advised to go to the labor and delivery unit. On presentation, the patient reported normal fetal movement and no fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, leaking fluid, or contractions. She had received prenatal care, including screenings for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (all of which were negative) and routine ultrasound examinations. During the third trimester, a glucose-tolerance test was positive. She had intermittent atypical chest pain that had lasted for several years; 2.5 months before admission, an evaluation of the pain included electrocardiography (ECG), which revealed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and transthoracic echocardiography, which was normal. At 17 years of age, she had presented at 20 weeks of gestation with sepsis and a stillborn fetus; dilation and evacuation had been performed. She also had anemia (Table 1) (with a history of iron deficiency), bipolar disorder, panic attacks associated with syncope and tingling on the left side, recurrent pelvic pain with pelvic adhesions, benign ovarian cysts, asthma, and seasonal allergic rhinitis; she had had a positive purified protein derivative skin test with a normal chest radiograph, which had been treated with isoniazid and vitamin B6for 9 months. She had undergone multiple laparoscopies, including cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, lysis of adhesions, and ovarian cystectomies. Medications included a prenatal multivitamin and ferrous sulfate; antidepressants were discontinued by the patient at the start of the current pregnancy. She was allergic to loperamide, morphine (which caused chest discomfort), meperidine hydrochloride (which caused hives), and contrast material (which caused a rash). She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was born in Guatemala, had immigrated to the United States 15 years earlier, and had last visited Guatemala 3 years earlier. She lived with her boyfriend. She had worked in an office but was currently receiving disability benefits because of her bipolar disorder. Her mother had had breast cancer and died in her 50s. On examination, the temperature was 35.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/68 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Her abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender, with active fetal movements. The fetal heart-rate tracing was reassuring. There was no peripheral edema or abdominal tenderness. Reflexes were normal, as were the remaining general and neurologic examinations. The capillary glucose level was 111 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter). Blood levels of uric acid, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, globulin, and total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013caffeine were administered, followed by prochlorperazine, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine; the patient\u2019s condition partially improved. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head could not be performed because of the patient\u2019s anxiety; preliminary magnetic resonance venography showed no evidence of sinus thrombosis. After 24 hours of observation in the labor and delivery unit, the patient\u2019s symptoms had not resolved, and she was admitted to the hospital. She reported occipital headache, which she rated at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). Later that day, MRI of the head was performed without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1A and 1B). Diffusion-weighted images showed multiple (at least eight) small hyperintense lesions scattered throughout both cerebral hemispheres, in white and gray matter; the largest lesion (7 mm in maximal diameter) was located in the left centrum semiovale, with no evidence of associated intracranial mass or hemorrhage. The lesions were thought to reflect infarcts that had occurred at least 6 hours earlier. Results of magnetic resonance angiography and venography were normal. Axial MRI Scans of the Head.Images were obtained at the level of the centrum semiovale. A diffusion-weighted image (Panel A) shows multiple small hyperintensities that are indicative of acute infarcts. A few of the lesions seen on the diffusion-weighted image (Panel A, arrow) had corresponding hyperintensities on a fluid-attenuated inverted recovery image (Panel B, arrow), but most did not (Panel A, arrowhead); these findings indicate that the infarcts had occurred at different times. A diffusion-weighted image that was obtained 2 days later (Panel C) shows two new punctate foci of diffusion restriction that are indicative of new acute infarctions (arrowhead). Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. ECG showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 108 beats per minute and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Holter monitoring did not reveal an arrhythmia. A lumbar puncture was unsuccessful; the patient declined further attempts. Aspirin (81 mg daily), metoclopramide, and prenatal vitamins were administered. On the third day, the prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal, as were results of tests for factor VIII, partial-thromboplastin time\u2013lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG and IgM antibodies, functional antithrombin III, functional protein C, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin gene mutation; other test results are shown inTable 1. Betamethasone was administered (in two 12-mg intramusclar doses 24 hours apart) to promote fetal lung maturity. An active, well-grown fetus was seen on ultrasound examination. The patient\u2019s headache resolved. The next day, on evaluation by ophthalmology consultants, she reported no acute change in vision, eye pain, or eye redness, but she did have floaters, which she described as \u201cworms.\u201d On examination, there was binocular horizontal diplopia (which could be relieved with the use of corrective lenses) and a pterygium on the left side, with no evidence of papilledema, embolic phenomena, or vasculitis on funduscopic examination. Testing revealed antibodies to hepatitis A virus; screening for hepatitis B and C viruses was negative. Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 1C) revealed multiple foci of restricted diffusion, including a few that were new in the bilateral frontal and right occipital lobes. These findings were thought to be consistent with multiple small acute infarcts. On the fifth day, transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 2; andVideos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a hyperkinetic left ventricle without wall-motion abnormalities and with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole. The right ventricular apex was akinetic and aneurysmal. In both ventricles, there was prominent accumulation of sessile, smooth-bordered endocardial material with an echodensity that was distinctly different from that of the myocardium; this finding was not present on the previous echocardiogram. Thrombus in the left ventricle would be unlikely in this case given the diffuse accumulation of endocardial material and the absence of global or regional dysfunction. Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could produce a hyperkinetic ventricle with obliteration of the left ventricular cavity during systole but not one in which the wall has an echodensity that is different from that of the myocardium. Thus, the findings were suggestive of endocardial deposits. There was no patent foramen ovale or clinically significant valvulopathy (specifically no valvular thickening, vegetations, tethering, or malcoaptation) and only trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Tissue Doppler echocardiography, Doppler assessment of the transmitral flow velocity and pulmonary-vein flow velocity, and assessment of the color M-mode propagation velocity revealed that the left ventricular diastolic function was normal. Transthoracic Echocardiograms.A still image obtained in the apical four-chamber view near end systole (Panel A) shows thickening of the midventricular and apical left ventricular walls, with obliteration of the cavity. A still image obtained in the parasternal short-axis view, below the level of the papillary muscles, in diastole (Panel B) shows marked thickening of the left ventricular walls due to an accumulated sessile material that has an echodensity that is distinctly different from that of the myocardium. A still image obtained in the subcostal four-chamber view in diastole (Panel C) shows aneurysmal dilatation of the right ventricle and sessile, echodense deposits in the apex.", "true_dx": "The hypereosinophilic syndrome due to parasitic infection (most likely toxocariasis) acquired through pica, with L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome and cardioembolic strokes.

Approximately 6 years before this presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, which had been made by a rheumatologist at another hospital. Two years before this presentation, the patient had had a sudden onset of pain on the right side of the lower back and buttock, with hypoesthesia and weakness in the right leg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lumbosacral disk protrusion at L5\u2013S1, with moderate-to-severe foraminal encroachment on the right side. Needle electromyography revealed evidence of L5 radiculopathy on the right side. Neurosurgery consultants recommended physical therapy, and two glucocorticoid injections were administered, which improved symptoms. However, 2 months later, electromyography revealed persistent active L5 radiculopathy on the right side that had not improved since the previous study had been obtained. Approximately 1.5 years before this presentation, the patient\u2019s rheumatologist reported that the patient had a persistent right foot drop and persistent tenderness of the paraspinal muscles. In addition, a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was made on the basis of the gradual onset of bilateral hand and wrist discomfort and hand paresthesias. Approximately 5 months before this presentation, the patient noted the onset of a cough that produced thin yellow sputum. During the next month, exertional dyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing developed. Six weeks later (9 weeks before this presentation), the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at another hospital. On examination, rhonchi and wheezing were noted; the remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A diagnosis of bronchitis was made, and an albuterol inhaler and azithromycin were prescribed. The patient was referred to an allergist, because there were concerns about allergic bronchitis. Laboratory Data. On evaluation by the allergist, epicutaneous and intradermal skin tests revealed no reaction to pollens, molds (including aspergillus), or dust mites. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 2.51 liters (77% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.03 liters (70% of the predicted value), and a ratio of FEV1to FVC of 83%; these results were interpreted to be indicative of a restrictive ventilatory defect. There was no improvement after the administration of a bronchodilator; a methacholine challenge was not performed. The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) was 112 ppb (reference range, <25). Budesonide\u2013formoterol was prescribed. Two weeks later, the wheezing and cough had resolved. Repeat pulmonary-function testing revealed improvements, including an FEV1of 3.05 liters (94% of the predicted value), an FVC of 3.55 liters (82% of the predicted value), and a ratio of FEV1to FVC of 86%. The Fenohad decreased to 59 ppb. Ten days before this presentation, lethargy, myalgias, chills, headaches, anorexia, and night sweats developed. Nine days later, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician because of recurrent cough, night sweats, myalgia, and fatigue. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were described as harsh. A urinalysis was notable for the presence of microscopic hematuria; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Doxycycline was prescribed empirically for possible Lyme disease. The next day, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. He reported bitemporal headaches, and he described the pain as bandlike; the headaches had occurred intermittently at first and then constantly during the previous 3 days. He also reported associated neck stiffness and photophobia. He had a fever, aching of the jaw muscles with chewing, and diffuse aches, including joint pain of the hands, fingers, spine, hips, and knees. Nausea with one episode of emesis had occurred after he had taken a dose of doxycycline on an empty stomach; he took a total of three doses and then discontinued the medication when the serologic test for Lyme disease was reported as negative. He had no weight loss, vision changes, or other cardiac, pulmonary, joint, ocular, or neurologic symptoms. The patient had undergone surgery for knee osteoarthritis, had received physical therapy and glucocorticoid injections for rotator-cuff tendinopathies, and had had an appendectomy at 19 years of age. He had neck osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, sleep apnea, and peptic ulcer disease. He had had a negative tuberculin skin test in the past. Medications included a budesonide\u2013formoterol inhaler. Allergies reportedly included aspirin, which was noted to cause tightness in the throat. The patient lived with his wife and worked in a health care facility, where he was exposed to patients and multiple sick contacts. He drank alcohol on social occasions; he had smoked two packs of cigarettes per week during college and smoked cigars intermittently thereafter. He had traveled to Florida 1 month before this evaluation and to Europe and the Caribbean during the previous 8 months; he had had no animal or insect exposures. His father had died at 54 years of age from complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus; his mother had had hypothyroidism and had died at 83 years of age from acute leukemia. A sister had systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. On examination, the temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/74 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared mildly ill. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There was no tenderness on the scalp or head. The neck was described as stiff. Inspiratory crackles were present in both lungs. There was mild synovial thickening in the hands, a finding consistent with chronic arthritic changes. There was no asymmetry on neurologic strength testing. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of coagulation tests were normal, and the IgE level was less than 5 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Portable chest radiography showed clear, well-inflated lungs. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed signs of chronic sinusitis, including opacification and wall thickening in the frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Because of the persistent headache and neck stiffness, a lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained. Analysis of the CSF revealed a nucleated-cell count of 1 per cubic millimeter and a protein level of 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55).

She had been well until the age of 24 years, when she began having episodes of \u201ca feeling of walking through a cloud,\u201d hearing spoken words without understanding, an inability to speak, and vertigo. A witness described events lasting less than 1 minute, during which the patient would stare at her hands, make gripping movements, and sometimes swear, and then be confused for 2 to 3 minutes. She had little memory of events after the episodes. During several episodes, she lost muscle tone and collapsed. During the next 8 years, episodes recurred at an accelerating rate, sometimes with loss of consciousness, abrupt collapse, and occasional incontinence. The frequency increased 4 to 5 days before menses. Three months before this evaluation, the patient struck her head during a typical episode. She was admitted to another hospital, where results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, Holter monitoring, routine and 3-day ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG), and multiple blood tests were reportedly normal; no episodes occurred during monitoring. There was no symptomatic improvement after the administration of triptans or beta-blockers. Subsequently, the frequency of episodes increased to at least daily. On evaluation at this hospital, she reported no fever, chills, rashes, neck pain, tinnitus, baseline vertigo, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, weakness, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms, or changes in vision, hearing, balance, gait, or bladder habits. Between the ages of 9 and 22 years, she had had occasional episodes of syncope after painful stimuli (such as immunizations or blood draws). She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her husband and children and worked in a pharmacy. She drank alcohol infrequently, had stopped drinking caffeinated beverages after the onset of these symptoms, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of headaches and drug abuse, and her father was healthy; there was no family history of neurologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure and pulse were normal, with appropriate orthostatic changes. A detailed neurologic examination and the general physical examination were normal. A diagnosis of probable complex partial seizures with secondary generalization was made, and the patient was advised to stop driving. Two months later, a 72-hour ambulatory EEG captured 10 seizures arising from the left temporal lobe, all of which were noted by the patient. Lamotrigine was administered and the dosage was increased to 150 mg twice daily, with reduction in the frequency of events from three times daily to approximately once every 3 days. One month later, MRI of the brain was performed. MRI was performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1), in accordance with an epilepsy protocol. On T2-weighted images, there is a well-demarcated focus of increased signal intensity in the left inferomedial temporal lobe. The mass does not enhance with gadolinium. It has heterogeneous signal intensity that is predominantly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The mass involves the occipitotemporal (fusiform) gyrus and causes mild local mass effect. The appearance is most suggestive of a primary brain neoplasm, such as a low-grade glioma. In retrospect, the same finding is present on the study from 6 months earlier, although it is harder to identify because of the positioning of the slices. MRI Images of the Brain.A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) and a T2-weighted axial image (Panel B) from an MRI scan obtained at the level of the temporal lobes show a heterogeneous but predominantly hyperintense mass lesion in the inferior left temporal lobe (arrows). During the next 7 months, the patient continued to have staring spells, some of which were associated with sudden loss of postural tone and collapse. Antiseizure medications, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and clonazepam, were aggressively adjusted without a clinically significant effect.

The patient had observed routine quarterly surveillance imaging after resection of right axillary melanoma, radiation therapy, and initiation of pembrolizumab therapy 3 years earlier. The most recent imaging was performed 6 days before this evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground-glass halos (Figure 1A through 1D). These findings were new relative to the most recent imaging performed 3 months earlier. Other pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right upper lobe that had been noted on imaging studies obtained during the previous 3 years were stable. Changes in the right upper lobe that had resulted from radiation therapy were also stable relative to previous imaging studies. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe that measured 9 mm in greatest dimension and a cyst in the left hepatic lobe that measured 15 mm in diameter; both were unchanged from previous imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. Imaging Studies of the Chest.Six days before evaluation at this hospital, CT of the chest was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the scan shows new bilateral hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Panel A), a new peripheral patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe (Panel B), and new bilateral pulmonary nodules (Panels C and D, arrows). Positron-emission tomography and CT had been performed 3 years before the current evaluation; the scan shows a 3.5-cm right axillary soft-tissue nodal mass (Panel E, arrow) with foci of intense18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (Panel F) and no other sites of avidity. The patient was referred by her oncologist for urgent evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no symptoms, specifically no fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, new or changed skin lesions (except a mild traumatic abrasion on the right arm), pruritus, or new masses. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for superficial spreading melanoma on the right upper back that had initially been diagnosed two decades before this evaluation and had been surgically excised, with clear pathological margins. Eleven years later, an in situ superficial spreading melanoma developed on the left upper back and was completely excised. Three years before the current evaluation, locally advanced melanoma in the right axilla was diagnosed on the basis of a positron-emission tomographic and CT image that showed a 3.5-cm right axillary nodal conglomerate mass with multiple foci of intense18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake; no other sites of FDG avidity were seen (Figure 1E and 1F). Multiple pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right lobe and hypodense hepatic lesions, measuring 9 mm in the right lobe and 10 mm in the left lobe, were noted. MRI of the abdomen suggested that the hepatic lesion in the right lobe corresponded to a hemangioma and the hepatic lesion in the left lobe a cyst. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. At that time, dissection of the right axillary lymph nodes was performed, and examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 25 of 39 lymph nodes, with a high degree of extracapsular extension. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation. The patient received radiation therapy to the right axilla and supraclavicular fossa (total dose of 4800 cGy over a period of 5 weeks), followed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for the next 12 months. During this course of treatment, lichenoid nodules developed on the fingers of both hands, tenosynovitis developed in the right ankle, and hypothyroidism was diagnosed, for which treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. These findings were attributed to adverse effects of the immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The plan for surveillance imaging included CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which was to be performed every 3 months, and MRI of the head, which was to be performed annually. The patient\u2019s medical history also included bilateral ovarian cysts, osteopenia, and a melanocytoma of the left optic disc that had been stable for at least 13 years. A Papanicolaou smear and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus performed 3 years before this evaluation had been negative. Routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this evaluation had revealed dense breast tissue with bilateral calcifications that appeared to be benign; no suspicious lesions were noted. Medications included calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born on the northern coast of South America and had immigrated to the United States as a child. She lived in New England with her husband, two children, and two cats. She worked in the health care industry. She drank one or two glasses of wine per day and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. One month before this evaluation, she and her family had traveled to the northern coast of South America for 1 week. On the trip, the patient spent most her time outdoors, including taking trips to the jungle and swimming in fresh water, and ate local cuisine, such as water chestnuts. When she returned home with her family, her husband and one of her children had generalized myalgias and malaise that resolved spontaneously. The patient\u2019s mother had breast cancer, melanoma, and basal-cell carcinoma; her father had prostate cancer; and her daughter had mixed connective-tissue disease. Her maternal grandfather had colon cancer, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer, and her maternal cousin had melanoma. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 123/68 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. She appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. Examination showed fair skin, multiple nevi without suspicious features, and healed scars at the sites of previous surgical procedures. There were lichenoid nodules on the fingers of both hands. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests. The complete blood count and differential count were also normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative, and the level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60).

The patient was in his usual health until approximately 2 weeks before admission, when nausea, dizziness, tinnitus, and unsteady gait developed; these symptoms were associated with subjective fevers. Five days before admission, a diagnosis of respiratory infection with inner-ear symptoms was made; the symptoms decreased transiently. Three days before admission, the patient awoke at 4 a.m. and noted diminished muscle control, which was more severe in the arms than in the legs, and shaking in the hands. Reaching for his eyeglasses required intense concentration and slowing of reaching movements. He had difficulty rising and was unable to walk. He was admitted to another hospital, where sequential examinations revealed fluctuating arm weakness and dysarthria, which sometimes lessened with repeated testing. The complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and C-reactive protein; results of tests of renal and liver function were also reportedly normal. A chest radiograph reportedly showed small, bilateral pleural effusions, with no consolidation or pneumothorax. Results of computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, and CT angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained by lumbar puncture contained 4 red cells and 188 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 88% lymphocytes, 5% segmented neutrophils, and 7% monocytes. Other test results were pending. Results of electromyography were reportedly normal. Antibiotic agents and prednisone were administered. During the hospitalization, horizontal diplopia developed, which disappeared when one eye was covered. On the third evening, sweats and chills occurred. The next day, he was transferred to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported diplopia, tremors that were more pronounced in his arms than in his legs and that worsened when he used those limbs, increased urinary frequency, night sweats, and chills, with no numbness, tingling, pain, headaches, neck stiffness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rashes. He had had worsening heart failure during the previous 4 years, and a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis had been made 16 months before admission, after evaluation by positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest had revealed increased, high18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in lymph nodes of the chest and abdomen. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of mediastinoscopy had reportedly revealed confluent, nonnecrotizing granulomas with extensive hyalinization; silver and acid-fast staining had shown no organisms. A 4-month course of prednisone was administered between 16 months and 12 months before this admission. Four months before this admission, a 4-month course of prednisone and methotrexate was begun and was completed shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient also had hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease with stent placement, congestive heart failure, complete heart block, ventricular arrhythmias for which an automatic implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator had been implanted, mild asthma associated with allergies (which he had had since childhood), allergic rhinitis, and recent dental surgery, for which he had received unknown antibiotics for a period of 7 days. Medications were cholecalciferol, doxazosin, atorvastatin, sotalol, low-dose aspirin, folic acid, a multivitamin, fluticasone by inhalation, enoxaparin (subcutaneously), and, as needed, ipratropium by inhalation and nitroglycerin (sublingually). He had received that year\u2019s seasonal influenza vaccine. He lived with his wife and worked in an office. He did not drink alcohol, smoke, or use illicit drugs. His mother was more than 90 years of age and had a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was being treated with prednisone; his father had had a stroke, and his siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 93/53 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had subtle deficits in episodic memory, including difficulty in recounting elements of his own recent medical history. The pupils were round and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm in diameter to 2 mm. Extraocular movements were full, without nystagmus or saccadic breakdown. He had horizontal diplopia in all directions, with mild ptosis of the right eyelid. Tremors of the cheeks occurred on smiling, and the patient was unable to puff out his cheeks. Other cranial-nerve examinations were normal; however, the first cranial nerve was not tested. Motor examination revealed myoclonus of the arms, with no fasciculation or cogwheel rigidity. Strength was rated 4+ out of 5 in the fingers on the left hand with extension and was otherwise rated 5 out of 5. Light-touch sensation was preserved throughout. The deep-tendon reflexes were rated 1+ and were symmetric at the triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus. Plantar responses were mute on both feet. There was prominent arm-shaking on finger-to-nose testing when the patient\u2019s eyes were open; the shaking was less pronounced when his eyes were closed. Rapid alternating movements were normal, as were the results of heel-to-shin testing and mirroring testing. Gait and stance were not tested. Blood levels of troponin T were normal, as were results of urine analysis and renal function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. One dose of cefepime was administered, followed by ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin, and cardiac and bronchodilator medications. Laboratory Data. During the first hospital day, nausea and vomiting occurred, and the temperature rose to 38.8\u00b0C. Sequential neurologic examinations initially revealed increased somnolence, decreased orientation and ability to be aroused, slow verbal responses with dysfluent speech, and no evidence of dysarthria or dysphagia. Diplopia, right-eyelid ptosis, and coarse omnidirectional nystagmus in the primary position (i.e., when the patient was looking forward) were present, with no nuchal rigidity. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of lumbar puncture revealed an increased number of lymphocytes and background proteinaceous debris; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Gram\u2019s staining of a sputum specimen showed no leukocytes, a moderate number of squamous epithelial cells, and mixed flora; sputum cultures grew very few enteric gram-negative rods,Candida albicansandAspergillus fumigatus,and normal flora. Blood and urine cultures remained sterile. The temperature rose to 40.1\u00b0C. Acyclovir was added on the second hospital day. On the third hospital day, glucocorticoids were begun for hypotension. On the fourth hospital day, hyponatremia and progressive generalized weakness occurred, and fevers continued. CT images of the head on the fourth hospital day, obtained before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were normal for the patient\u2019s age (Figure 1A). Brain Imaging Studies.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed on the 4th hospital day, was normal (Panel A). Contrast-enhanced CT performed 5 days later revealed new, diffuse sulcal effacement and hypodensities in the white matter that were suggestive of edema and brain swelling (Panel B). New leptomeningeal enhancement and increased ventricular size could also be seen. On the 10th hospital day, CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed obliteration of the sulci and progression of hypodensities in both gray and white matter, as well as blurring of the gray\u2013white junction (Panel C). Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies was negative. Portable electroencephalography revealed generalized rhythmic delta activity and bifrontal triphasic waves, with diffuse irregular delta\u2013theta slowing. Lorazepam was administered, which resulted in improvement in generalized rhythmic delta activity but not in mental status. On the fifth hospital day, somnolence increased and mental status worsened. Cytologic examination of CSF obtained by means of a repeat lumbar puncture showed an increased number of lymphocytes with admixed neutrophils, macrophages, and occasional plasma cells, and no evidence of malignant cells; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Pressors for hypotension were administered intravenously; morphine sulfate and propofol were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation begun. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The next day, blood levels of thyrotropin, vitamin B12, folate, and cortisol were normal, as were results of liver function tests; testing for 1,3-beta-d-glucan was negative. Methylprednisolone and amiodarone were begun, and sotalol was stopped. Liposomal amphotericin was administered for 2 days. On the seventh hospital day, levetiracetam was begun. The next day, the level of N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide was 8227 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 900), and troponin T levels remained low. On the ninth hospital day, another lumbar puncture was performed, and the CSF was analyzed (Table 1). Later that evening, the pupils became nonreactive. Neurosurgical consultation was obtained, and additional imaging studies were performed. Contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed new, extensive hypoattenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, sulcal effacement, and marked expansion of the corpus callosum, which indicated brain swelling and edema. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also present (Figure 1B).", "true_dx": "Granulomatous amebic encephalitis, caused by acanthamoeba species.

Six years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated intermittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained. Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared unchanged from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the abdomen or pelvis. Initial Imaging Studies of the Chest.An axial chest CT image obtained 5 months before the current admission (Panel A) shows layering secretions within the trachea (arrow), as well as a patulous esophagus (asterisk). An additional axial image from the same CT examination (Panel B) shows bronchial wall thickening (arrows). A frontal chest radiograph obtained 3 months before the current admission (Panel C) shows patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. A frontal chest radiograph obtained 1 month before the current admission (Panel D) shows patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. A test forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level. Three months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the oropharynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predominantly in the right mid and lower lung. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora andCandida albicans; a test forPneumocystis jiroveciiwas negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen saturation and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxacin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His primary care physician prescribed inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symptoms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awakening with coughing and dyspnea. The temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air. A chest radiograph (Figure 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled albuterol and ipratropium was administered. A sputum culture grew normal respiratory flora andC. albicans. After two days, the patient was discharged home to complete a 7-day course of levofloxacin. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes. Eight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of focal consolidation that were present predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination. Subsequent Imaging Studies of the Chest.A frontal chest radiograph obtained 1 week before the current admission (Panel A) shows multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which are confluent in the right lower lobe. Axial (Panel B) and coronal (Panel C) chest CT images obtained 1 week before the current admission show new multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity; there are scattered areas of consolidation (arrows) that are most prominent in the right middle and lower lobes. A frontal chest radiograph obtained during the current admission (Panel D) shows progression of the diffuse reticulonodular opacities bilaterally, with additional patchy opacities throughout the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the previous chest radiograph obtained 1 week earlier. Axial (Panel E) and coronal (Panel F) chest CT images obtained during the current admission show increased diffuse centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity, patchy ground-glass opacities (arrow), and additional areas of consolidation (arrowheads) that are more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung; these findings indicate a progression of disease, as compared with the chest CT images obtained 1 week before the current admission (Panels B and C). The patient was again admitted to this hospital, and additional testing was performed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella antigen was negative. On the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora andC. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus,P. jirovecii, histoplasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forM. tuberculosiswas also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pulmonary clinic for 3 weeks later. Four days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a temperature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dysphagia.

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before the current admission, when a headache and sore throat developed, without a fever. On evaluation at her physician\u2019s office, a rapid test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative, and she returned home. During the next 2 days, throat pain persisted and oral intake decreased. She was admitted to the observation unit of another hospital because of dehydration, weakness, and fevers, with a temperature as high as 39.4\u00b0C. A chest radiograph was normal. The patient reportedly had a white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter, positive tests for IgG and IgM antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific viral capsid antigen and antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen, and negative tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza A and B viruses, and IgM and IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). A pharyngeal culture grew group C streptococcus. Cultures of the blood and urine were sterile. A diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis with possible bacterial superinfection was made. Intravenous fluids were administered, and her condition improved. On day 2, treatment with erythromycin was begun and she was discharged home. Nine days before the current admission, trismus, pain on opening the mouth, and swelling on the right side of the face and jaw developed. The patient returned to the emergency department of the same hospital; parotitis was diagnosed, and ibuprofen was administered. Pain persisted on the right side of the jaw and was associated with temperatures as high as 38.3\u00b0C and swelling and erythema of the right parotid gland and face. Six days before the current admission, the patient was seen at a second hospital; prednisone and narcotic analgesic agents were administered, and massage of the parotid gland was performed. She returned home. Fevers persisted, and edema of the right lateral side of the face and neck worsened. Three days later, she was seen by her physician and was admitted to the second hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck reportedly revealed no evidence of retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscesses. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and intravenous fluids were administered. Two days before the current admission, swelling of the right eyelids and horizontal diplopia developed. On evaluation, there was decreased abduction of the right eye. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed a multiloculated, rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right parotid gland and inflammation of the masticator space. There was linear enhancement of the pachymeninges in the right temporal region, a finding that raised concern about meningitis. Diffusion-weighted images obtained at the level of the parotid gland showed findings consistent with an abscess. There was an irregularity of the right cavernous sinus, without definite thrombosis. A subperiosteal abscess in the right orbit was also identified. The patient was transferred to a third hospital. On examination, she was alert and communicative. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was diffuse swelling of the right preauricular and periorbital areas, mild trismus, bilateral cervical submental and submandibular lymphadenopathy (greater on the right side than on the left), and preauricular and postauricular lymphadenopathy on the right side. White plaque was seen on the gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior tongue, which was painful when scraped. The right Stensen\u2019s duct was tender on firm compression, with no fluid discharge. On neurologic examination, the right eye had medial deviation, with an inability to abduct past the midline. The patient had mild difficulty with tandem walking. The general and neurologic examinations were otherwise normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, magnesium, globulin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and IgG, IgA, and IgM. Tests for heterophile antibodies, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, and HIV nucleic acid were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace protein, 3+ glucose, and 2+ urobilinogen, along with squamous epithelial cells and bacteria, findings suggestive of contamination. Laboratory Data. MRI of the head, orbits, face, and neck, performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 1), reportedly revealed changes consistent with multiple lobulated abscesses in the right parotid gland, with extensive inflammation surrounding the gland that involved the muscles of mastication, as well as a small subperiosteal abscess along the right lateral orbital wall, dural enhancement along the right temporal lobe, and enhancement along the cavernous sinus; these findings were again not thought to constitute definite evidence of thrombosis. Changes consistent with extensive periodontal disease were also seen. Vancomycin, meropenem, and clindamycin were administered. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of fluid collected in the parotid gland was performed, and the aspirate was cultured. The following day, CT of the sinuses, performed with the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed preseptal swelling of the right eye extending to the temporal fossa, subperiosteal enhancement adjacent to the right lateral rectus muscle, and heterogeneous enhancement and enlargement of the right parotid gland; there was no substantial improvement in the appearance of the orbital or parotid abnormalities as compared with the previous imaging studies. MRI Scans of the Head and Neck.T1-weighted images of the head and neck were obtained after the administration of contrast material. A coronal image of the head shows temporal pachymeningeal enhancement and subtle leptomeningeal enhancement, findings suggestive of basilar and temporal meningitis (Panel A, arrows). A coronal fat-saturated image (Panel B) and an axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel C) show changes consistent with abscess formation in the right parotid gland (arrows). Axial and coronal fat-saturated images (Panels D and E, respectively) show changes consistent with a subperiosteal abscess in the right orbit (arrows). The patient was transferred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. Medications on transfer included vancomycin, meropenem, clindamycin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and enoxaparin, as well as an albuterol inhaler, lorazepam, oxycodone, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, as needed. She reported having fatigue and double vision, without headache, pain in her eye or throat, or pain with eye movements. She had a history of dysmenorrhea, for which she took norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, and asthma. She was allergic to penicillins, which had caused urticaria, and was possibly allergic to cephalosporins. She lived with her family and attended high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and she had had no travel-related exposures. On examination, the patient was somnolent but arousable. The vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while she was breathing ambient air. The right parotid gland, face, and neck were swollen, with marked periorbital edema of the right eyelid, minimal erythema and tenderness, and no palpable fluctuance; the right eye had 1+ lateral clear chemosis (Figure 2). The right parotid gland was tender. There was a whitish plaque on the inner aspect of the right buccal mucosa, which was tender and had no obvious abscesses. The patient was able to swallow oral secretions. A systolic murmur, grade 1 out of 6, was heard at the left lower sternal border. There was bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, greater on the right side than on the left. On neurologic examination, visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. In the right eye, supraduction was limited by 50%, abduction was slightly limited, and infraduction and adduction were normal; the left eye had normal motility, with splinting on upgaze. Other cranial-nerve functions (excluding smell, which was not tested) and the remainder of the general and neurologic examinations were normal. Photographs of the Patient\u2019s Eye.On presentation to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, the patient had periorbital erythema and edema surrounding the right eye (Panel A) and conjunctival injection and chemosis (Panel B).

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 months before presentation to this hospital, when pain on the right side of the back developed. The pain began gradually after the patient had moved heavy furniture, worsened with activity and coughing, sometimes radiated down the back of the right arm to the elbow, and occasionally awakened him from sleep. During the next 2 months, the pain waxed and waned. Ice, ibuprofen, naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, and physical therapy were prescribed but did not lead to any improvement. One day before presentation to this hospital, the patient was seen in his primary care clinic because the severity of the back pain had increased and numbness and weakness of the right hand had developed. Radiography of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed spondylolisthesis, degenerative changes, and an anterior wedge deformity of the T9 vertebral body of indeterminate duration. The following day, after the imaging results were reviewed, the patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported severe, sharp, burning pain in the right shoulder, triceps, and upper and middle back. He also noted fatigue and increased urinary frequency. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hyperthyroidism. Medications included amlodipine, metoprolol, topiramate, ranitidine, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Peanuts and latex had caused urticaria. Multiple relatives had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient worked in security and did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances. He identified as Black and as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness; he stated that receiving blood transfusions was incompatible with his beliefs. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles were tender, more so on the right side than on the left side. Strength was 4 out of 5 when the patient extended his right shoulder and when he gripped the examiner\u2019s fingers with his right hand. Straight leg raising was normal bilaterally. Oral acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and diazepam and transdermal lidocaine were administered, and the patient was observed overnight in the emergency department. The next morning, the pain persisted; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. MRI of the spine (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed an enhancing, marrow-replacing mass involving the right posterior aspect of the T1 vertebral body, with resultant severe stenosis of the spinal canal and right neural foramen. The bone marrow signal was diffusely heterogeneous, and there were mild compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, including T9, as seen on radiography. Imaging Studies.Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was performed on the second hospital day. A sagittal T2-weighted image of the cervical spine (Panel A), a sagittal T1-weighted image of the thoracic spine with fat saturation obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel B), and an axial T1-weighted image of the T1 vertebral body obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel C) show a marrow-replacing, destructive lesion involving the T1 vertebral body and posterior elements (white arrows). The bone marrow signal is diffusely heterogeneous, and multiple thoracic vertebral bodies show superior end-plate compression deformities (Panel B, black arrows). There is severe spinal stenosis and leftward displacement of the spinal cord (Panel C, arrowhead) resulting from epidural extension of the mass. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed on the third hospital day. A coned-down sagittal image of the thoracic spine obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel D) shows the destructive lesion involving the T1 vertebral body (white arrow), partial superior end-plate collapse of multiple vertebral bodies (black arrows), and diffuse small, round lytic lesions in multiple vertebral bodies and the sternum (arrowheads), as well as incidental hepatic steatosis (asterisk). Chest radiography was performed on the fifth hospital day, on the day of the current evaluation. The radiograph (Panel E) shows low lung volumes but otherwise clear lungs. The blood calcium level was 19.7 mg per deciliter (4.92 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter]). The anion gap, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, thyrotropin, and prostate-specific antigen; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Serum and urine samples were obtained for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, and another serum sample was obtained to be analyzed for kappa and lambda free light chains. Additional imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the lytic lesion at T1 and the compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies. Multiple small osteolytic skeletal lesions were identified. There was no evidence of other mass lesions or lymphadenopathy. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the second hospital day; a diagnosis of cancer was suspected. On examination, he appeared fatigued and uncomfortable and had a flat affect. There was diminished sensation of the pads of the second and third fingers on the right hand; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Oral acetaminophen, subcutaneous calcitonin, and intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, hydromorphone, diazepam, and zoledronic acid were administered. Overnight, the patient became increasingly somnolent, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 91%. The following morning, on the third hospital day, auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and zoledronic acid were stopped, and intravenous normal saline, furosemide, and dexamethasone were begun. On the fourth hospital day, a CT-guided bone marrow biopsy was performed. Afterward, trace edema in the legs was noted. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed barrel-shaped crystals, and a 24-hour urine sample contained more than 5 g of protein; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A stool sample was guaiac-negative. Oral cholecalciferol and intravenous rasburicase were administered. Early the following morning, on the fifth hospital day, the oxygen saturation decreased to 86%, without shortness of breath. The rate of supplemental oxygen administration was increased to 6 liters per minute, but the oxygen saturation did not increase. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the heart and lungs was normal. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and chest radiography was performed. An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed low lung volumes and otherwise clear lungs (Figure 1E).", "true_dx": "Rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia in the context of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Approximately 5 years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy at another hospital. Treatment with oral prednisone and cyclosporine was initiated. Two years later, the patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for worsening proteinuria and hypertension; rituximab, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide were administered. During the next 21 months, he received four doses of rituximab, the last of which was administered 3 months before this presentation. Three months before this presentation, the patient had a flash of light accompanied by transient sharp pain in the left retro-orbital area and forehead, with monocular blurry vision. He was subsequently evaluated at the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the head were normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered, and he was discharged. One week later, the patient was reevaluated at the same hospital for an episode of garbled and nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension that resolved after 10 minutes. A CT angiogram and an MRI of the head reportedly showed a subacute infarct in the right side of the pons; intravenous alteplase was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was normal. Mild word-finding difficulties and confusion persisted. After discharge, the patient had worsening vision with floaters in the left eye, headache, photophobia, sonophobia, and fatigue. Three weeks later, he was evaluated by a neuro-ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013caffeine therapy and ophthalmic prednisolone drops for suspected uveitis. The vision improved, and headaches decreased during the subsequent 2 weeks; however, 1 week later, he was readmitted to the other hospital with sudden onset of weakness on the right side, facial droop, and garbled speech. The weakness resolved after 10 minutes. CT and MRI of the head and TTE were reportedly unchanged from the previous imaging studies. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed focal left temporal slowing, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. The garbled speech resolved after 2 days, and he was discharged from the hospital. During the next week, the patient had recurrent staring spells that lasted for 1 minute, during which his family thought he appeared \u201cvacant\u201d; low-grade fever also developed, and within 48 hours, the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C and the garbled speech recurred. He was readmitted to the other hospital, and CT of the head was again reportedly normal. Blood levels of calcium, albumin, globulin, ammonia, thyrotropin, lactate, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative, and levels of complement were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A lumbar puncture was performed; tests for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiand West Nile virus were negative, and a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test of the CSF was nonreactive (Table 2). The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.

A review of systems provided by the patient\u2019s family was notable for somnolence, fatigue, generalized weakness, unsteadiness, headaches, staring spells, floaters in the left eye, photophobia, sonophobia, mild neck stiffness, unintentional weight loss of 10 kg in the past 6 months, and nocturia. The patient reported no muscle or joint pain, rash, eye pain, diplopia, oral lesions, cough, dyspnea, nausea, or abdominal pain. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, early-onset coronary artery disease for which he had received percutaneous coronary intervention in his 50s and for which he had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting in his 60s, congenital color blindness, colonic polyps, and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included cyclophosphamide, levetiracetam, aspirin, pravastatin, metoprolol, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, omeprazole, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, and fluticasone. He had not taken other antibiotic agents or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The patient was a retired government employee and lived with his wife in northern New England. He had recently traveled to Florida and to rural Canada and had spent time hunting. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years but had quit 7 years before the current presentation. He drank two beers per week and did not use illicit substances. His family history included coronary artery disease in both parents and valvular disease in his mother, psoriatic arthritis in a sister, and sarcoidosis in several siblings; there was no history of renal or neurologic disease. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.4. He appeared cachectic, with bitemporal wasting. He was somnolent and difficult to arouse with voice; he was oriented to self and intermittently to place, month, and year. His thoughts were perseverative. On mental-status examination, he was unable to name days of the week backward (he named a month and then named the days forward) and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations. Occasional word-finding difficulties were noted, although repetition, naming, and reading were generally intact. When asked to remember three words, he could recall only one word after 5 minutes. He reported that nine quarters equaled $4.25. His affect and speech were intact. The cranial-nerve examination revealed blurriness in the visual fields, \u201cdiscomfort\u201d with eye movements, and limited upward gaze. There was no weakness or pronator drift; a low-amplitude intention tremor was present in the left hand. The muscle tone was increased in both legs, with diffuse hyperreflexia, pectoralis reflexes, and seven beats of ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glycated hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A comprehensive urine toxicology screen was negative, and a serum toxicology screen was negative for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 andTreponema pallidumwere negative. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. A chest radiograph was normal. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass lesion. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus was noted. MRI of the head (Figure 1) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed signal hyperintensity in the sulci on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with associated subtle enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images; additional subarachnoid and subdural foci characterized by restricted diffusion with no enhancement; nonspecific changes in the white matter; opacification of the right maxillary sinus; and no vascular abnormality.

The patient had reportedly been well until approximately 6 months before this admission, when fatigue, fever, chills, shortness of breath, and erythema in the right leg developed. He was admitted to another hospital. A chest radiograph showed band atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest that was performed on the same day revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs, consolidation in the lingula and lower lobes, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A diagnosis of cellulitis of the right leg was reportedly made. Therapy with doxycycline and cefazolin was begun; the patient\u2019s condition improved, and he was discharged home with a plan to continue a 7-day course of the antibiotic agents. During the next 6 months, multiple episodes occurred that consisted of fatigue and decreased appetite, followed by chills, severe weakness, dyspnea, fevers (to a temperature of 39.4\u00b0C), and hypoxemia. During that time, the patient was admitted at least six additional times to two different hospitals. Multiple CT scans of the chest, the most recent of which had been obtained 6 weeks before this admission, showed improvement of the air-space opacities in the lower lobes but persistence of the upper-zone ground-glass opacities. Antibiotics were administered during the episodes, and symptoms improved within 1 to 4 days; without the administration of glucocorticoids, the patient\u2019s condition returned to baseline within 8 days. No infectious causes were identified. Bronchoscopic examination with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 3.5 months before this admission, and the BAL fluid reportedly contained 30% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 32% macrophages, and 2% eosinophils; microbiologic testing and cytologic examination were negative. Results of transthoracic echocardiography were normal, and a videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed mild oropharyngeal dysphagia that cleared with spontaneous subsequent swallows. A diagnosis of possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis was made. Approximately 5 weeks before this admission, the patient was discharged from one hospital and admitted on the same day to a third hospital for further evaluation. Blood levels of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and thyrotropin were normal; serum testing for galactomannan, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, and antibodies to strongyloides was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. CT of the sinuses revealed moderate opacification in the left maxillary sinus and left infundibular obstruction. On the fourth day, the percentage of eosinophils in the peripheral blood rose to 5.9% (reference range, 0 to 5), with an absolute eosinophil count of 320 per cubic millimeter. No ova or parasites were seen in a stool specimen. A diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis was considered. Laboratory Data. After discharge, the patient moved into a hotel. However, 3 weeks before this admission, fevers and dyspnea recurred and he was readmitted to the third hospital. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies, antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and antinuclear antibodies was negative, as were thick and thin blood smears for parasites; blood levels of total tryptase, mature tryptase, IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE were normal. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were sterile, and results of urine cultures were consistent with contamination. The next day, combined positron-emission tomography and CT revealed widespread bilateral ground-glass opacities and associated peribronchiolar consolidation predominantly in the lower lobes; these findings had minimal18F-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity. Bronchoscopic examination with BAL was performed, and the BAL fluid contained 58% macrophages, 18% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, and 12% eosinophils; the fluid also contained 19% CD4+ T lymphocytes (reference range, 40 to 58) and 57% CD8+ T lymphocytes (reference range, 10 to 40), with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.33 (reference range, 0.56 to 4.27). Polymerase-chain-reaction testing for adenovirus was negative. No organisms or malignant cells were seen, and pathological examination of a transbronchial-biopsy specimen reportedly showed evidence of acute focal lung injury (including hyaline membranes), hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and mild chronic interstitial pneumonitis. Surgical lung biopsy was recommended, and the patient was discharged on the fifth hospital day. Eighteen days later, the patient and his wife came to the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital. He reported the onset of fatigue and shortness of breath beginning earlier that day and suspected another episode was beginning. He reported night sweats, weight loss of 6.4 kg that he attributed to multiple hospitalizations, and no wheezing, cough, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, or known aspiration. He was not aware of any precipitating factors. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, mild psoriasis, venous stasis, and depression. He lived with his wife and three adult dogs, worked primarily in an office, and reported no known exposure to asbestos, birds, reptiles, or hay. He smoked cigars on rare occasions, previously drank one alcoholic beverage per day until he stopped drinking several months before this presentation, and did not use illicit drugs. He had traveled to coastal Massachusetts 7 months earlier and had no other recent travel. Medications were atorvastatin, omeprazole, and fluoxetine. He was allergic to cephalosporins (which caused a rash and elevated aminotransferase levels). There was no family history of lung or autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient appeared fatigued and was shivering. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 148/67 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air and 99% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The height was 193 cm, the weight 104.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. The chest rose symmetrically, without use of accessory muscles or wheezing. Sparse crackles were heard at the right lung base, and 1+ leg edema was present, without cyanosis or clubbing. The remainder of the examination was normal. He was referred to the emergency department for admission to this hospital. On examination in the emergency department, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 155/76 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, plasma anion gap, and results of serum electrophoresis and tests of coagulation and renal and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, ionic calcium, albumin, globulin, lactic acid, troponin T, NT-proBNP, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, IgG, IgA, and IgM. Other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 102 beats per minute. A chest radiograph showed minor bibasilar patchy opacities, which had improved during the previous 3 weeks. On the second day, CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed improvement in the bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes. The previously noted consolidation had resolved. Mildly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes had not changed during the previous 3 months.

The patient had been generally well until approximately 2 years before the current admission, when persistent pain of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine developed. Approximately 11 months before admission, he fell and had increasing back spasms thereafter, with partial improvement after chiropractic treatment. During the 2 months before admission, he lost approximately 10 lb (4.5 kg) and his back pain became more severe; he rated it at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The pain was chronic with exacerbations, was localized in the thoracic and lumbar regions without radiation, worsened when he lay flat (despite the administration of narcotic agents for pain control), and diminished with ambulation. On the morning of admission, MRI was performed (without the administration of gadolinium) at another hospital to evaluate the patient's increasing symptoms (Figure 1). Fluid-sensitive images showed that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies (T10 and T11) was filled with fluid, and there was prominent bone marrow edema involving T10 and T11. These findings raised diagnostic concern about the possibility of diskitis\u2013osteomyelitis or fracture with pseudoarthrosis. MRI Scan of the Spine.On the day of admission, MRI of the spine was performed. A fluid-sensitive sagittal image of the thoracic spine shows that the disk space between the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebral bodies is filled with fluid (Panel A, arrow). There is also prominent bone marrow edema involving the adjacent vertebral bodies. A fat-sensitive sagittal image of the lumbar spine shows bridging ossifications at the levels of the T12\u2013L1 disk space and the L1\u2013L2 disk space (Panel B, arrows). The patient was advised to go to the emergency department at this hospital for evaluation. On arrival, he reported intermittent numbness in both feet (greater in the left toes than in the right toes), but he had no shortness of breath, chest pain, leg weakness, or urinary or bowel incontinence. He had hypertension, nonischemic idiopathic cardiomyopathy with global hypokinesis, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, and fatigue with exertion. He had a history of obesity, depression, gout, nephrolithiasis, an adrenal nodule, and elevated results of liver-function tests, as well as one episode of iritis of the left eye 15 years before admission. He had also undergone numerous orthopedic procedures after traumatic injuries, including arthroplasty of the right knee and arthroscopy of the right ankle. The ankle symptoms, which included chronic discomfort requiring prolonged use of crutches, were thought to have exacerbated his back pain. Medications included lisinopril, furosemide, atenolol, allopurinol, fluoxetine, acetylsalicylic acid, and thiamine hydrochloride, with hydrocodone and diazepam as needed for back pain and spasms. He had no known allergies, drank alcohol in moderation, and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married, had adult children, and had worked in a service industry until he became disabled by his back and ankle pain. He walked with the use of a cane or crutches. His father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the blood pressure was 152/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs and the oxygen saturation were normal. There was tenderness on palpation over the paraspinal regions of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions, without pain over the spinal processes. The left knee was warm to the touch, and a small effusion was present. There was trace pitting edema bilaterally. Strength was normal in both legs, but there was mild loss of sensation of light touch in the toes. The remainder of the examination was normal. The level of C-reactive protein was 8.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). A complete blood count, a white-cell differential count, and results of tests of coagulation and liver and renal function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin. Oxycodone was administered for pain.

The patient had been well until 3 weeks before admission, when he began to have decreased energy and poor appetite, symptoms that were associated with a weight loss of 4.5 kg. The next week, he was evaluated by his primary care physician. The patient reported dyspnea on exertion, diffuse myalgias, and severe fatigue that prevented him from engaging in his usual activities of walking outside, gardening, and swimming in the ocean. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 124/73 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Tests for hepatitis C antibodies, antitreponemal antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen, and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A stool test was positive for occult blood, and a diagnostic colonoscopy was scheduled. Laboratory Data. Three days before admission, the patient felt feverish but did not check his temperature at home. Fevers continued, despite the use of acetaminophen. One day before admission, he had one episode of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. On the day of admission, the patient had an unwitnessed fall while he was standing in the bathroom; he reported that he had felt generally weak and had tried to sit down but fell backward and struck his head, without loss of consciousness. He was found on the floor by a family member and was unable to stand up. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported generalized myalgias but no headache, photophobia, or neck stiffness. He had a history of hypertension, non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Medications included lisinopril and aspirin; the diabetes was controlled by diet. He had no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. He had not smoked tobacco in 30 years but had previously smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. He was retired, resided in New England, and had not traveled outside the region in several years. He did not have pets or known exposures to bats. He had recently cleaned out the basement of his home, where he had occasionally seen mice. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 140/64 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was diaphoretic but did not appear ill. He was alert and oriented, and he answered questions appropriately. Examination of cranial nerves II through XII was normal. Strength and sensation to light touch were intact in the arms and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes in the arms and legs were normal; the plantar reflex was flexor bilaterally. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. There was no rash. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. A urinalysis was unremarkable; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Imaging studies of the head did not show evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. The lungs were normal, with no pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy. Mild circumferential thickening of the middle and distal esophagus was noted. No focal hepatic lesions, thickening or distention of the gastrointestinal tract, or suspicious lytic or blastic lesions of the bones were noted. The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 12 hours, altered mental status developed, with progressive confusion, difficulties with word finding, and inability to consistently follow commands. Several attempts at lumbar puncture for analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were unsuccessful, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. Additional studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed scattered foci of signal abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter, with no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. Electroencephalography revealed intermittent irregular delta slowing that was most prominent in the left frontocentral area and intermittent diffuse theta slowing in the background, with no epileptiform abnormalities. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 19.5 cm of water; other results are shown inTable 1. Doxycycline was administered orally. Fevers continued, despite the administration of acetaminophen. The blood cultures had no growth. Progressive tachypnea developed, and the patient was unable to lie in a recumbent position to undergo repeat MRI of the head. Elective intubation was performed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. On the fourth hospital day, repeat MRI of the head was performed. FLAIR images showed new mild, diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci, and FLAIR and T2-weighted images showed mild hyperintensity in the medial thalami and medial temporal lobes (Figure 1). MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed on the fourth hospital day. There is mild hyperintensity in the medial temporal lobes (Panel A, arrows) and the thalami (Panels B and C, arrowheads), as well as mildly increased signal in the sulci, most notably in the sylvian fissures (Panel B, arrows). There are scattered hyperintense foci in the white matter, most prominently in the left corona radiata (Panel D, arrow). Physical examination, which was performed while the patient was not receiving sedation, revealed decreased tone and no spontaneous movements of the arms or legs, findings consistent with flaccid paralysis. There was also no withdrawal in response to nail-bed pressure, and deep-tendon reflexes were absent in the arms, knees, and ankles bilaterally. The patient opened his eyes but did not regard or track the examiner and did not respond to requests. The diameter of the pupils was 3 mm bilaterally and decreased to 2 mm in response to bright light. The corneal reflexes and cough reflex were intact, but there was no grimace in response to pressure in the supraorbital notch. On the 10th hospital day, nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory responses of the left median and ulnar nerves were prolonged and had moderately-to-severely reduced amplitude, and the motor responses of the bilateral median nerves had severely reduced amplitude, normal conduction velocities, and normal durations. Stimulation of the muscles by means of needle electromyography revealed abundant fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in the left deltoid, extensor digitorum communis, first dorsal interosseous, and tibialis anterior muscles, as well as increased insertional activity in the left vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius muscles and no voluntary motor units in the left arm or leg.

The patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. One day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the patient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. During the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported difficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation, although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions. Medications included extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a disengaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concentrating. His speech was slow and soft, with reduced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of associations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department. Transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested, but no beds were available at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphenhydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intramuscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes. On day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intramuscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the examination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient reported malaise and lightheadedness with standing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydration was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. Blood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital.

Six weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2. Four weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommendations from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home. Six days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient\u2019s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient\u2019s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact. On examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% at rest and 98% during ambulation, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

She was interviewed with the assistance of her daughter. The patient had reportedly been well until approximately 8 years before this evaluation, when gradually progressive difficulties with word finding developed, along with associated confusion about the meaning of some words. For example, during a conversation about a recent family event, she did not understand what the phrase \u201cpunch bowl\u201d meant. She also had increased egocentric behavior, during which she spoke most frequently about herself. She had a good memory for recent events of her life and could recount multiple stories (at times to an excessive extent during history taking, such that she required refocusing). She had an excellent sense of direction. She had an uncharacteristically matter-of-fact reaction to the death of a sibling and of her dog (being less upset than her family expected). She occasionally had mildly inappropriate behavior, such as saying \u201cI love you\u201d to people to whom she was not particularly close. The patient was right-handed. Approximately 10 years earlier, she had a tick bite and was treated with antibiotic agents after a test for Lyme disease was positive. When she was 7 years of age, she fell out of a tree and hit her head, but she did not lose consciousness and was not hospitalized. There was no history of recent head injury, stroke, seizure, transient ischemic attack, meningitis, encephalitis, exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, thyroid disorder, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, cancer, pulmonary disorders, exposure to heavy metals, or learning disability. Her only surgical history included three cesarean sections. Her medications were a multivitamin, vitamin C, ginkgo biloba, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and she had no known allergies. Since the death of her husband 10 years earlier, she had lived alone (in a different state than her daughter) and was able to perform all activities of daily living independently, including managing her money, paying bills, and volunteering in the community (i.e., visiting senior centers to play piano and attending regular community choir practices). She drank alcohol once or twice per month and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had been a teacher and had later worked in business with her husband until his death. A brother in his 60s had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and a sister in her 80s had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia. Her six children and her grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the patient was alert, attentive, well-groomed, cooperative, and pleasant. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute and regular, and the weight 68.6 kg. She had a score on the Mini\u2013Mental State Examination of 28 (with scores ranging from 0 to 30 and higher scores indicating better cognitive function), because she was unable to recall the name of the hospital or the county. She had a score on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale of 0 (with scores ranging from 0 to 3 and lower scores indicating better cognitive function). The neurologic examination was normal, including evaluation of the 2nd through 12th cranial nerves, power, bulk, tone, coordination, stance, and gait; the deep tendon reflexes were 1+ throughout. The platelet count was 362,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 350,000), and the folate level was 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference range, 3 to 17 ng per milliliter [7 to 39 nmol per liter]). The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, and blood levels of vitamin B12, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of renal- and liver-function tests. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive, and testing for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiwas negative. As part of the standard evaluation for a suspected cognitive impairment, the patient was referred for neuropsychological testing, speech pathological evaluation, and imaging studies of the head. On neuropsychological testing, the patient\u2019s performance on a screen of nonverbal abilities indicated that she had average premorbid intellectual abilities. Language impairment was evident both through clinical observations and when she performed verbal tasks, including tasks of confrontation naming, verbal fluency (for which she had substantially more difficulty with semantic fluency than with phonemic fluency), verbal abstraction, and comprehension of individual words. Her spontaneous speech was fluent, but she had notable difficulty with word finding and made occasional paraphasic errors. She often had difficulty comprehending words, such as \u201ccork,\u201d \u201cmisplaced,\u201d \u201cbored,\u201d and \u201cpessimism.\u201d Her performance on tests of attention and executive functioning varied; her greatest impairments were evident when the tasks required language mediation, and these impairments contrasted with her generally normal performance on tasks that were not verbally mediated. Similarly, her performance was normal on a test of nonverbal memory but was substantially impaired on a test of verbal memory. Her storage of verbal information was difficult to assess because of her impaired acquisition and anomia. Her storage of nonverbal information was normal, as was her performance on visuospatial tasks. She did not report symptoms of depression or anxiety on self-reported assessments. Ms. Daisy Hochberg:Speech pathological evaluation revealed that the patient had fluent, articulate speech with pauses for word finding, vague word substitutions, and circumlocutions. She was somewhat tangential in her speech and was fixated on telling stories from her life, such that she required frequent refocusing on the topic at hand. She had substantial impairment on a test of naming, with superordinate responses, and she had impairment on word\u2013picture matching. Rare phonemic paraphasias were present. Auditory comprehension was impaired for words she no longer recognized and for sentences with complex syntax. Sentence repetition was intact. A written language assessment revealed that she could read normally and had mild agrammatism in written language samples. A semantic picture\u2013picture matching test revealed no evidence of visual agnosia.

The patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm developed. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8\u00b0C. Twenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course. Sixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a \u201csoftball\u201d in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and watery diarrhea that occurred three times per day. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest. The abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bilobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter), multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter), mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites. Imaging Studies.Fifteen days before admission to this hospital, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at the first hospital. A coronal image (Panel A) shows splenomegaly (spleen length, 14 cm; normal value, \u226412) and nonfocal fat stranding and trace ascites (asterisks) along the right sigmoid mesentery and left anterior renal fascia. Transaxial and coronal images (Panels B and C, respectively) show a bilobed anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, with soft-tissue attenuation (arrows) and enlarged lymph nodes (arrowheads). Nine days before admission to this hospital,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed at the second hospital. A thick-slab, sagittal maximum intensity projection of attenuation-corrected PET images (Panel D) shows low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal mass (arrow) and an enlarged left cervical lymph node (arrowhead). On the first day at this hospital, dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT was performed. A transaxial iodine map (Panel E) shows minimal enhancement of the anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm (arrow), as compared with the enhancement of prominent mediastinal lymph nodes (arrowheads). On the 13th day at this hospital, MRI was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. A transaxial fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) image (Panel F) shows interdigitated fat and hypointense soft tissue, as compared with muscle, in the anterior mediastinum (arrows). The respiratory distress was caused by large bilateral pleural effusions (asterisks). Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tissue, as well as in pleural effusions and mediastinal lymph nodes. During the next week, dyspnea and abdominal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight increased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondansetron, and lactulose were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).

Eight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consultation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospital for consideration of blepharoplasty. In the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiffness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open-angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (performed 2 months before the current presentation), intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), bupropion, fluoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The administration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit substances. On examination, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was present, along with mild erythema of the upper eyelids (Figure 1). The upper-eyelid skin was overhanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retropulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The levator palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference range, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunctivae; there was no evidence of superficial punctate keratopathy or cells in the anterior chambers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patient\u2019s known history of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck. Clinical Photographs at Presentation.Photographs of the eyes were obtained in several gaze positions. In primary gaze, the patient has edema and mild erythema of the upper eyelids, along with festoons of the lower eyelids (Panel A). The upper-eyelid edema is more pronounced when viewed from below (Panel B). There is mild limitation of extraocular motility in all gaze positions, including up gaze (Panel C), right gaze (Panel D), left gaze (Panel E), and down gaze (Panel F). The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the face and orbits (Figure 2A and 2B), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral enlargement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbits (Figure 2C through 2F), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed orbital fat stranding and mild, symmetric, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eyelids and face, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted. Imaging Studies of the Face and Orbits.CT of the face and orbits was performed. A coronal image (Panel A) shows abnormal, curvilinear stranding in otherwise normal, low-attenuation orbital fat (red arrow). Mild, diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles, including the superior and medial rectus muscles in both eyes, is also present (asterisks). An axial image (Panel B) shows abnormal, curvilinear stranding in otherwise normal, low-attenuation orbital fat (red arrow); preseptal soft-tissue thickening along the anterior margin of both globes (blue arrow); and fat stranding along both temples (yellow arrow). MRI of the face and orbits was also performed. A coronal T1-weighted image (Panel C) shows abnormal stranding (gray) in normal orbital fat (white), which has high signal intensity (red arrow). A coronal short-tau inversion recovery image (Panel D) shows abnormal stranding (white), which has high signal intensity that spares the myotendinous junctions, in normal orbital fat (gray), where the signal is suppressed (red arrow). Diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles, including the superior and medial rectus muscles, is also present and has high signal intensity (asterisks). An axial T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, fat-saturated image (Panel E) shows abnormal stranding and enhancement in the retrobulbar and episcleral fat (red arrows), diffuse thickening and enhancement of the preseptal soft tissue (blue arrow), and enhancement along the optic-nerve sheaths (yellow arrows), a finding consistent with perineuritis. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel F) shows diffuse preseptal soft-tissue thickening with low signal intensity along the anterior margin of both globes (red arrow). The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter (reference range, 767 to 1590), the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter (reference range, 341 to 894), and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter (reference range, 171 to 632); the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative, including an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiscomplex infection was negative.

She rapidly regained consciousness, and her husband called emergency medical services. On evaluation by paramedical personnel, the oxygen saturation was 71% while she was breathing ambient air and increased to 99% while she was breathing oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. She was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by ambulance. On evaluation, the patient reported feeling well, with no shortness of breath, chest pain, light-headedness, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; she had had no similar episodes in the past. She reported having a transient episode of cramping in the left calf on the morning of admission that had resolved spontaneously. She had no other notable information in her medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her husband, had no children, and was a retired health care worker. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; maintenance therapy included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Six months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell\u2013mediated or antibody-mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued. One month before the current admission, pathological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal infiltrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and interstitial Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection. Two weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]); routine laboratory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The patient also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Current medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, labetalol, nifedipine, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and belatacept. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administrator and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. On the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were dry, and the throat could not be evaluated because of nausea. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic examination was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs. The blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium level 13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the chest (Figure 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was suggestive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Figure 2) revealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Imaging Studies of the Chest Obtained on Admission.A frontal radiograph (Panel A) shows multiple tiny pulmonary nodules (arrows) scattered diffusely throughout both lungs in a miliary pattern. Coronal (Panel B) and axial (Panel C) images from a CT on lung windows show numerous small bilateral nodules (yellow arrows) that are new relative to imaging obtained 6 months earlier. The distribution of nodules is random, a characteristic that is suggestive of a hematogenous origin. There is a small right pleural effusion (Panel C, blue arrow). A coronal CT image obtained with soft-tissue windows (Panel D) shows enlarged bilateral hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes that are partially calcified (arrows). These findings are consistent with the known history of chronic sarcoidosis. CT of the Abdomen and Spleen.Shown are coronal images of the abdomen obtained with soft-tissue windows from CT performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material 6 months before admission (i.e., baseline) (Panel A) and on admission (Panel B). There has been development of splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 16 cm on admission. A small volume of new perihepatic ascites is also present (arrow). While the patient was being evaluated in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids and intravenous infusion of phenylephrine were administered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Within 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was continued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 \u03bcmol per liter), the lactic acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter), and the calcium level to 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter).

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admission, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech. The patient had a history of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib (with discontinuation of bortezomib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy), as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier. Other medical history included latent tuberculosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertraline, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, fluticasone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identified with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no proptosis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. The blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), the hematocrit 39.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the white-cell count 8090 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The IgM level was 540 mg per deciliter; the level of IgM kappa M component in the gamma region was 0.36 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function. Tests for Lyme disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis were negative. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild thickening and perineural enhancement along the entire length of the left optic nerve (Figure 1A and 1B). There was a deformity of the left lamina papyracea with medial deviation of the medial and superior rectus muscle, as well as postoperative changes in the sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, was limited by artifact but revealed increased signal intensity and possible focal enhancement within the retrobulbar segment of the left optic nerve (Figure 1C and 1D).

Her boyfriend called emergency medical services (EMS), and a team was dispatched to the patient\u2019s home. On assessment by EMS personnel, the patient had jaundice and diaphoresis. She appeared fatigued. The pulse was 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 82/56 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. Nystagmus occurred on right lateral gaze. The abdomen was distended, and tenderness was present in the right lower quadrant. The capillary blood glucose level was 121 mg per deciliter (6.7 mmol per liter), and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen (through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute) were administered, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported burning abdominal pain, which she rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 107/42 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, with tenderness on the right side, and there was trace edema of the legs. The results of the examination were otherwise unchanged. The blood carbon dioxide level was 21 mmol per liter (reference range, 24 to 34), and the blood glucose level was 104 mg per deciliter (5.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The anion gap and blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests and a serum toxicology screen, which included a test for acetaminophen. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head (obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material) were normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mildly increased hepatic parenchymal echogenicity (Figure 1A). This finding, although nonspecific, could reflect hepatic steatosis or diffuse parenchymal disease. No focal liver lesions were identified. The gallbladder was distended, with apparent wall edema, a small amount of pericholecystic fluid, and layering sludge (Figure 1B). The common bile duct was normal in diameter, with no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation (Figure 1C). The spleen was mildly enlarged, to a greatest longitudinal diameter of 13 cm (normal, \u226412). Abdominal Ultrasound Images.Grayscale ultrasound images show mildly echogenic parenchyma of the liver (Panel A) and distention of the gallbladder, with layering sludge, wall edema, and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid (Panel B). A color Doppler ultrasound image shows that the common bile duct is normal in diameter (Panel C). Pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound images show normal flow of the hepatic artery (Panel D), portal veins (Panel E), and hepatic veins (Panel F). Intravenous fluids, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, morphine, ondansetron, andN-acetylcysteine were administered, and packed red cells were transfused. Five hours after arrival at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported that the abdominal pain and light-headedness had resolved and the nausea had decreased. She recalled that during the past several days, her gums had bled easily when she brushed her teeth and her urine had been tea-colored. She had a history of mild asthma. Eleven weeks earlier, she had given birth to her first child; after an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, preterm labor developed and was complicated by placental abruption, and vaginal delivery occurred at 32 weeks of gestation. The patient reported that she had remained in the hospital for 1 week after delivery because of unspecified abnormal laboratory test results. Her medications were albuterol as needed, azithromycin, and promethazine\u2013dextromethorphan syrup; she did not take herbal remedies or supplements and had no known allergies. Immunizations were reportedly current. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England where she currently lived with her daughter, boyfriend, and boyfriend\u2019s parents. She was of Southeast Asian descent and had been born in the United States. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. A grandmother had unspecified liver disease. On examination, the patient appeared tired and had marked jaundice. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/58 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. Conjunctival icterus was present. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness; abdominal guarding, rebound tenderness, and Murphy\u2019s sign were absent. There was a 1.5-cm laceration on the chin. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed smudge cells, burr cells, basophilic stippling, rouleaux formation, dysplastic neutrophils, and 1+ polychromasia. The anion gap, venous blood-gas measurements, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, magnesium, glucose, amylase, lipase, and fibrinogen; additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A serum toxicology screen was negative, and a urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates and negative for all other analytes. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, amber-colored urine with a specific gravity of 1.019, a pH of 6.0, 2+ bilirubin, 2+ urobilinogen, and 1+ occult blood by dipstick; there were 0 to 2 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed persistent evidence of wall edema and intraluminal sludge in the gallbladder. Murphy\u2019s sign was absent, although this finding was not reliable because of the prior administration of analgesic agents. Pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography revealed normal arterial flow in the main hepatic artery (Figure 1D). There was also normal hepatopetal flow in the portal veins (Figure 1E) and hepatofugal flow in the hepatic veins (Figure 1F). The administration ofN-acetylcysteine was continued, and the chin laceration was sutured.

The patient had been well until 3 years before this presentation, when his wife noticed that he was unwilling to share a portable media player that had been given to them, whereas he had previously been very generous and caring. He began to listen obsessively to audio books, insisting that he and his wife listen while cooking or driving. He impulsively purchased items they could not afford. Formerly very social, he began spending time alone; he made mistakes at work and failed advanced-degree examinations. When his wife became pregnant, he repeatedly voiced fears about losing his job if he took paternity leave. He began drinking alcohol and smoking obsessively until he vomited. After the baby was born, he seemed to be disinterested in spending time with his wife and newborn. The patient left his job as a high-school teacher because he planned to run a small home business and care for the infant so his wife could return to work. His clients soon complained about the poor quality of his work. He mixed the infant\u2019s formula incorrectly and forgot to finish dressing the infant before leaving the house. His wife became concerned and began taking the baby to work, which did not bother the patient. The patient was seen by his physician at another facility for a routine evaluation. His wife reported his withdrawn, compulsive behaviors. He had had a serious head injury with loss of consciousness in a car accident at 12 years of age and was otherwise healthy. A presumptive diagnosis of depression was made. Eleven months after symptom onset, the patient was stopped by police for reckless driving while intoxicated, and he was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. Computed tomography of the head reportedly revealed encephalomalacia in the temporal lobes, a finding that was attributed to the head trauma that had occurred during childhood. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 1 week. A diagnosis of severe depression was made, and he was released to the care of relatives; this caused him to miss Christmas with his wife and child, which did not seem to concern him. During the next 2 months, multiple psychiatric evaluations and two neurologic evaluations were performed. A behavioral neurologic evaluation reportedly revealed mild parkinsonism, attentional and executive dysfunction, memory impairment, anomia, and a flat affect. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head that was performed during that time revealed severe focal atrophy in the anterior left temporal lobe and relatively mild diffuse atrophy in the frontal lobes (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). T2-weighted images showed a small area of hyperintensity in the white matter of the anterior left temporal lobe; the parenchymal signal was otherwise normal. The hyperintensity and focal atrophy in the left temporal lobe might be suggestive of encephalomalacia related to remote trauma, but the atrophy in the frontal lobes is not typical of traumatic brain injury and suggests a neurodegenerative process. Neuroimaging Studies.Neuroimaging studies were obtained 3 years before this evaluation. An axial T2-weighted image of the brain shows diffuse loss of parenchymal volume (Panel A). A coronal T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image shows severe focal atrophy in the left temporal lobe, with a small area of hyperintensity in the underlying white matter (Panel B, arrow). A sagittal T1-weighted image shows mild atrophy in the frontal lobes bilaterally (Panel C). Further neuroimaging studies were obtained during this evaluation. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel D), a coronal T1-weighted image (Panel E), and a sagittal T1-weighted image (Panel F) show marked progression of atrophy, which is now severe and has a knifelike appearance in the temporal and frontal lobes and insular cortexes. There is relative but not absolute sparing of the parietal lobes (Panels C and F, arrowheads). Findings on electroencephalography were reportedly normal. Progressive behavioral deterioration continued; the patient became unable to care for himself. Seventeen months after symptom onset, he moved to another state to live with relatives and attend a full-time day program. One year later (at 31 years of age), he returned to New England to be admitted to a neurorehabilitation facility. On admission, he recognized family but was unable to communicate. He was occasionally incontinent. Three years after symptom onset, he was no longer able to walk or feed himself and ate pureed food. He was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic of this hospital. Medications included trazodone, benztropine, hydroxyzine, omeprazole, and haloperidol. On examination, the patient was unable to follow commands and had a masked face. He was able to track a dollar bill with his eyes and had intact extraocular movements; smooth-pursuit eye movements revealed saccadic intrusions. He did not reach for the dollar bill when it was offered to him. Muscle bulk was diminished; there were no fasciculations. Tone was increased in all limbs, with mild cogwheel rigidity, occasional myoclonus, and prominent bilateral grasp reflexes. The physical examination was otherwise normal.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moderate associated periaortic fat stranding (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm (Figure 1C). Imaging Studies.At the other hospital, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Axial and sagittal images (Panels A and B, respectively) show soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta (arrows) and associated periaortic fat stranding. CT angiography was performed 1 hour later. The angiogram (Panel C) more clearly delineates aortic wall thickening (arrows) at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (asterisk), with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm. At this hospital, CT angiography was performed 12 days after the initial study. The angiogram (Panel D) shows an increase in the aortic diameter to 4.2 cm at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (asterisk), with associated aortic wall thickening (arrows) and increasing luminal irregularity (arrowhead) in the distal abdominal aorta and left common iliac artery. Three-dimensional volume renderings of the initial CT angiogram (Panel E) and the CT angiogram obtained at this hospital (Panel F) are provided. As compared with the initial study, the later study shows the development of multifocal luminal irregularity (Panel F, arrowheads) and interval narrowing of the inferior mesenteric artery (Panels E and F, asterisks). The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after discharge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day. The fever and chills resolved, and the abdominal pain abated initially but then gradually worsened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days before the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. Physical examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter. The urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, cannabinoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. CT angiography revealed progression of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm. The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile. Consultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested. On the second hospital day, magnetic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.6 cm) with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.9 cm) with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold. CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneurysmal enlargement and increased luminal irregularity (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1F). The patient had a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years earlier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, clonidine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of marijuana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints. On examination, the patient was uncomfortable because of the abdominal pain. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 576,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 57 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8.0). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth.

The patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and college. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered. Twenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, \u226411), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with metoprolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure. Electrocardiograms.An electrocardiogram obtained 25 years before the current evaluation (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that meets the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Electrocardiographic tracings obtained during the next 15 years showed similar findings. An electrocardiogram obtained 9 years before the current evaluation (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm with complete heart block and escape rhythm with right bundle-branch block and left-axis deviation. During the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exertional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlodipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene\u2013hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema. A repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thickening, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The blood pressure remained well controlled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril. Nine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptomatic bradycardia (Figure 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesophageal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun. During the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Four years before the current evaluation, during a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intravenous furosemide and discharged with a prescription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness. At follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white-matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary-function testing were normal. The patient presented for the current evaluation at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participation in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no headache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled fluticasone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication. The patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his father, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The patient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco. On examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic murmur that could be heard throughout the precordium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results were notable for a creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine were normal, and a test for antinuclear antibodies was negative.

The patient had been in her usual health and able to perform normal activities of daily living (including walking one block) until 3 days before admission, when fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and dry heaves developed. On the day of admission, substernal chest discomfort occurred; she awoke in the late evening with pain in the upper chest that she rated at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), with associated tightness, dyspnea, and nausea. On evaluation by emergency medical services personnel, the blood pressure was 116/80 mm Hg, the pulse 164 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute (labored), and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia with a regular wide QRS complex. Amiodarone and ondansetron were administered intravenously; the pulse slowed to 100 beats per minute, and the chest pain and tightness diminished. When the patient\u2019s daughter arrived at the emergency department of this hospital, she reported that 2.5 months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to another hospital for 1 day because of throat tightness and dyspnea. At that time, an ECG had shown sinus rhythm and left bundle-branch block, and cardiac telemetry had been negative. The troponin level had been elevated, at 0.06 ng per milliliter (reference value, <0.03). A chest radiograph had shown small pleural effusions and hyperinflation. During that admission, a rash was noted; the patient had reported a history of intermittent rash or bruises on the face, neck, and trunk of approximately 3 years\u2019 duration, with worsening during the previous 6 months. The acute symptoms resolved, and the patient was discharged the next day, with instructions to undergo transthoracic echocardiography and a stress test at an outpatient clinic and a biopsy of her rash by a dermatologist; none of these tests had been performed before she was admitted to this hospital. The patient had hypertension, long-standing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and a history of colonic polyps. Medications were aspirin, calcium carbonate, vitamin D supplements, and biotin. She was allergic to sulfa drugs, which caused a rash. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She lived alone and her children lived nearby. Her father had had an abdominal aortic aneurysm; there was no other family history of cardiovascular or dermatologic disease. On examination, the patient was in respiratory distress and responded to questions with one- or two-word answers. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 109/69 mm Hg, the pulse 94 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air. She had jugular venous distention to 11 cm of water, poor air movement, diffuse bilateral lung crackles, and scattered purpuric lesions on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. The remainder of the examination was normal. Oxygen supplementation was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, and the oxygen saturation rose to higher than 90%. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute and left bundle-branch block. A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) showed patchy and confluent opacities in both lower lobes and small bilateral pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with pulmonary edema. Chest Radiographs.Anteroposterior chest radiographs that were obtained at the time of the initial evaluation (Panel A) and 9 hours later (Panel B) show indistinct pulmonary vessels, perihilar and bibasilar opacities, and bilateral pleural effusions, findings that are compatible with progressively worsening pulmonary edema. Cardiac pacing pads and other support devices are visible on both radiographs. Blood levels of hemoglobin, urea nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio; other test results are shown inTable 1. Testing for influenza types A and B, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease was negative. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, yellow urine, with 1+ protein by dipstick, squamous cells, and mucus. Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside in the emergency department, revealed decreased cardiac function, with poor visualization of the right ventricle and no evidence of pericardial effusion. Thoracic ultrasonography revealed lung sliding and multiple B-line artifacts bilaterally. Bilevel positive airway pressure was administered but was discontinued when vomiting occurred. Aspirin, atorvastatin, furosemide, ondansetron, and morphine were administered, and a heparin infusion was begun. A cardiology consultation was obtained, and the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) 4 hours after presentation. Laboratory Data. On examination in the cardiac ICU, the patient appeared to be in respiratory distress and reported having air hunger. The respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. There was trace edema of the legs. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. In the cardiac ICU, dyspnea persisted and fatigue increased. The blood levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, glycated hemoglobin, vitamin B12, and folate were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. One dose of ticagrelor was administered, followed by a nitroglycerin infusion and doses of vancomycin, cefepime, and furosemide. A chest radiograph (Figure 1B) showed progression of the multifocal opacities in the lungs and enlarging pleural effusions. These findings are compatible with worsening pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to evaluate the ongoing chest pain and the shortness of breath that was associated with respiratory failure. The left ventricular systolic function was moderately impaired; the left ventricle had a normal size and increased wall thickness. The right ventricular size and systolic function were normal, and the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 46 mm Hg. The left atrium was enlarged, with thickening of the anterior and posterior mitral-valve leaflets and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation but no other valvular disease. Bilateral pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion without hemodynamic significance were noted. Pulsed-wave Doppler imaging of the mitral valve revealed a restrictive filling pattern, with a very high early diastolic filling velocity (E wave), a short deceleration time (<130 msec), and a low late diastolic filling velocity (A wave) (Figure 2; andVideo 1, available with full text of this article at NEJM.org). Transthoracic Echocardiogram.A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained on admission to the cardiac intensive care unit. A parasternal long-axis view (Panel A) and an apical four-chamber view (Panel B) show a normal-size left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV); there is mild thickening of the LV and of the mitral-valve leaflets, dilatation of the left atrium (LA), and pleural effusion (Panel A, asterisk). Approximately 10 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the cardiac ICU (approximately 14 hours after presentation), she was sedated and paralyzed, and the trachea was electively intubated. Mechanical ventilation was initiated. Shortly thereafter, a pulmonary-artery catheter was inserted, and coronary-artery angiography revealed diffuse, minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease. On hemodynamic assessment, the pressure was 13/11 mm Hg with a mean of 10 mm Hg in the right atrium, 48/7 mm Hg in the right ventricle, and 49/27 mm Hg with a mean of 34 mm Hg in the pulmonary artery; the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 25 mm Hg. Cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 2.9 liters per minute (cardiac index, 1.7 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area). Additional furosemide was administered. On the morning of the second day, the patient was breathing spontaneously, and the trachea was extubated. Cool oxygen was administered through a face tent at a concentration of 40%. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was negative, as was testing for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. On the third day, the blood iron level was 16 \u03bcg per deciliter (3 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 30 to 160 \u03bcg per deciliter [5 to 29 \u03bcmol per liter]), the blood iron-binding capacity was 196 \u03bcg per deciliter (35 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 230 to 404 \u03bcg per deciliter [41 to 72 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the total complement level was 191 U per milliliter (reference range, 63 to 145). Levels of C3, C4, ferritin, and thyrotropin were normal, and testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, celiac disease, and cryoproteins was negative. The patient was transferred to the cardiac telemetry unit. Analysis of a urine specimen revealed a high level of kappa Bence Jones protein in three molecular forms, as well as trace albumin. A dermatology consultation was obtained to evaluate the rash. On examination of the skin, there were purpuric and ecchymotic plaques, macules, and papules on the face (particularly affecting the perioral region), neck, trunk, and arms (Figure 3), as well as violaceous macules on the dorsal and lateral tongue and perianal ecchymoses. There was no purpura around the eyes after pinching (pinch purpura) and no macroglossia. The conjunctivae were clear, and the nails were normal. Clinical Photographs.The patient has purpuric and ecchymotic plaques on the face, particularly affecting the perioral region. Dark violaceous nonblanching plaques extend down the neck, upper back (Panel A), and upper chest (Panel B). The dorsal and lateral aspects of the tongue have violaceous macules but no macroglossia (Panel C).", "true_dx": "Systemic amyloidosis.", "pred_dx": "Amyloidosis", "correct": true, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got an elderly lady who suddenly starts experiencing chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a rash.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's pretty concerning.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She also mentions feeling fatigued, nauseous, and has some gastrointestinal issues like dry heaves.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, that sounds like something systemic might be happening.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The ECG shows tachycardia with a wide QRS complex.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That could point towards some kind of arrhythmia or maybe even a myocardial infarction.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, the troponin level is only slightly elevated, so it doesn't seem like a classic heart attack.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And the chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema, which makes me think there's fluid buildup in the lungs, possibly due to heart problems.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, let's consider the rash.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's described as purpuric and ecchymotic, and it's all over her face, neck, and trunk.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This type of rash can sometimes indicate a vasculitis or a clotting issue.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and she's got a history of taking aspirin, which can increase bleeding risk.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, she's got a history of colonic polyps, which could be relevant too.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Her dad had an abdominal aortic aneurysm, so there's a possible genetic link to vascular issues.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But there's no family history of similar skin conditions.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, interesting.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's keep that in mind.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's got jugular venous distension and poor air movement, suggesting some sort of heart failure or fluid overload.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and mitral valve thickening, which could contribute to her symptoms.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But the key finding is the restrictive filling pattern on the mitral valve, which suggests something more specific.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and then there's the urinalysis showing Bence Jones proteins.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Those are typically linked to multiple myeloma, where abnormal proteins build up in the blood and kidneys.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 23, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Multiple myeloma can cause skin rashes and kidney issues, and it can also lead to amyloidosis, which affects the heart valves.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 24, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Putting it all together, we've got a mix of cardiac symptoms, a distinctive rash, and lab findings pointing toward multiple myeloma.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 25, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Amyloidosis seems like a strong possibility here.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 26, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It would explain the heart involvement, the rash, and the Bence Jones proteins.", "t": 5, "c": "2", "i": 27, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Yeah, I'm leaning towards amyloidosis as the most likely diagnosis.", "t": 5, "c": "11", "i": 28, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "## Final Response", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 29, "x": null, "y": null}]}, {"id": "4723021d52380482b7838df102b231b5", "qid": 149, "prompt": "A 63-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of fever, hypotension, and hypoxemia. Five months before the current admission, weakness of the proximal muscles of the arms and dyspnea on exertion developed in the patient. One month later, she was admitted to this hospital with worsening symptoms. Follicular erythematous papules were present on the lateral aspect of both hips, and the blood creatine kinase level was 1856 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150). A skin biopsy of the lesions on the lateral hips revealed interface dermatitis. A diagnosis of dermatomyositis was made. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative, and treatment with prednisone and azathioprine was initiated, along with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis againstPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia. An extensive evaluation for cancer \u2014 including mammography, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, transvaginal ultrasonography, colonoscopy, and a Papanicolaou smear \u2014 was unrevealing. After the initiation of prednisone and azathioprine therapy, the blood creatine kinase level decreased to 683 U per liter, and the patient had a temporary mild increase in strength. Despite the initial improvement of the patient\u2019s symptoms, the proximal muscle weakness gradually worsened and the blood creatine kinase level increased during the next several weeks. Dyspnea on exertion progressed, and when the patient was chewing, she noted fatigue in the muscles of her jaw and neck. Three months before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her rheumatologist and reported severe dyspnea at rest. She was readmitted to this hospital for further evaluation, and additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest was performed during expiration and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Bilateral ground-glass opacities in a mosaic distribution were present, and there was no consolidation (Figure 1). CT Scan of the Chest Obtained 3 Months before Admission.Axial and coronal images (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained after the administration of contrast material, show mosaic attenuation of the lung parenchyma and no consolidation. To further assess the worsening dyspnea on exertion and the abnormalities seen on imaging studies of the chest, pulmonary-function testing was performed. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and ratio of FEV1to FVC were normal, as were the total lung capacity, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and maximal respiratory muscle strength. The patient reported difficulty swallowing, and a diagnosis of aspiration was considered. A video swallow study showed only mild oropharyngeal dysphagia and no evidence of aspiration. Because the patient had ongoing proximal muscle weakness despite treatment for dermatomyositis, a diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy was considered and additional testing was performed. Needle electromyography revealed abnormal spontaneous activity that was suggestive of ongoing muscle injury in the left deltoid and left vastus lateralis muscles, and magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg revealed extensive muscle edema and enhancement that were consistent with myositis, as well as focal nonenhancing areas that were suggestive of necrosis. Despite treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), the proximal muscle weakness and dyspnea persisted. Treatment with rituximab was initiated. The proximal muscle weakness and dyspnea diminished, and on hospital day 10, the patient was discharged; prednisone and azathioprine were continued. Three weeks later, she was evaluated by her rheumatologist and reported improvement in her weakness and dyspnea; the dose of prednisone was tapered from 60 mg to 40 mg daily. One month before the current admission, dysphagia increased and new weakness of the distal muscles of the arms developed in the patient. Repeat electromyography of the arms revealed persistent myopathy in the proximal muscles and new myopathy in the distal muscles. A muscle biopsy was performed. Pathological evaluation of a biopsy specimen of the right quadriceps muscle revealed an active inflammatory myopathy, and electron microscopy revealed tubuloreticular inclusions in endothelial cells, a finding supportive of the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the patient was again treated with IVIG. On the day of the current admission to this hospital, the patient was seen in the rheumatology clinic and then referred to the emergency department for evaluation because of a 2-day history of increasing fatigue, chills, night sweats, increased dysphagia, and a new productive cough. The patient reported no dysuria, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or headache. She had a history of glaucoma and hypothyroidism. Ten years earlier, she had been treated with a 6-month course of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis, which had been diagnosed with the use of tuberculin skin testing. In addition to prednisone and azathioprine, her medications included levothyroxine, liothyronine, and a multivitamin. She had received the last infusion of rituximab 10 weeks earlier. Her mother had myasthenia gravis, and multiple family members had had lung cancer. She worked as a health care provider, lived in New England, and had traveled to California but not outside the United States. On examination, the temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/47 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 to 6 liters per minute, with adjustment to keep the oxygen saturation above 93%. The patient was awake and alert but appeared generally unwell. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs, and there was no jugular venous distention. Crackles were present in the lower lung fields. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The liver and spleen were not palpable. The arms and legs had no edema, and muscle bulk was diffusely decreased. Strength was symmetric and graded as 4 out of 5 in the proximal and distal muscles of the arms, 4 out of 5 in the proximal muscles of the legs, and 5 out of 5 in the distal muscles of the legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were diffusely hypoactive in the arms and knees and normal at the ankles. Cultures of urine and blood had no growth. Testing of a nasal swab for influenza A and B nucleic acids was negative. A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies was negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph showed a patchy linear opacity at the base of the left lung. Intravenous fluids, high-dose methylprednisolone, vancomycin, and cefepime were administered, and the patient was admitted to the ICU while she received a continuous infusion of norepinephrine. Azathioprine was discontinued, and atovaquone was substituted for trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. Laboratory Data. The blood pressure improved. Norepinephrine and methylprednisolone were discontinued, prednisone was resumed, and the patient was transferred to the medical unit. Vancomycin and cefepime were continued. The patient\u2019s need for supplemental oxygen to maintain 93% saturation varied from 1 liter delivered through a nasal cannula to 10 liters delivered through a face tent. Additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new consolidations in the dependent portion of the bilateral lower lobes and inferior lingula. In addition, new interlobular septal thickening, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and trace bilateral pleural effusions were present. Subpleural reticulations were seen in the lower lobes. There was no intrathoracic lymphadenopathy (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Chest Obtained On Admission.Axial images, obtained without the administration of contrast material, show ground-glass opacities (Panels A and B, white arrows) and new consolidations in the dependent portion of the lower lobes (Panels B and C, black arrows). A repeat video swallow study was obtained on hospital day 8 because of concerns about possible aspiration pneumonia. There was moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia and intermittent trace aspiration. The patient had no fever for 3 days, but on hospital day 5, the temperature rose to 39.6\u00b0C. During the next 3 days, high temperatures persisted despite continued treatment with vancomycin and cefepime.

Twenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment. Twenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastrointestinal series, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified. During the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching. Eighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved.

Currently, this is reported as a percentage relative to normal function. Ten years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruritus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tightness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospital. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the patient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus. The swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hydroxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency. Four months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after venipuncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days. Two weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poisoning, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days. One week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump inhibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care. Other history included hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone previous appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasonographic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm. Medications included amlodipine, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two children in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The alanine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter (reference range, 9 to 32). CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thickening of the jejunal wall with associated mesenteric edema and small-volume free intraperitoneal fluid. The remainder of the small bowel and colon showed no abnormalities (Figure 1). CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis.Images of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, show long-segment marked circumferential jejunal-wall thickening (Panels A and B, arrows) with associated mesenteric edema (Panels A and B, arrowheads) and small-volume free intraperitoneal fluid (Panel C, asterisk).

The patient was born at another hospital after 40 weeks 4 days of gestation. His mother had had a positive 1-hour glucose challenge test and a negative 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test during pregnancy. Terminal meconium was present at delivery; the 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 9, respectively. At birth, the weight was 3.6 kg (72nd percentile) (Figure 1). Growth Charts.This patient\u2019s growth charts include data on body length and weight (Panel A) and head circumference and weight-for-length (Panel B) relative to the percentiles for boys up to 24 months of age. Within the patient\u2019s first hour of life, respiratory distress developed. The blood glucose level was reportedly 4 mg per deciliter (0.2 mmol per liter) and remained low despite oral intake of formula. The patient was admitted to the special care nursery, where intravenous fluids that contained dextrose were administered; the blood glucose level normalized and the respiratory distress resolved. A blood culture was sent, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. On the patient\u2019s third day of life, the blood culture remained negative. Antibiotic agents and intravenous fluids were discontinued, breast-feeding was initiated, and a blood glucose level of more than 50 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol per liter) was maintained. While the patient was in the special care nursery, he had occasional brief episodes of bradycardia, with heart rates between 70 and 80 beats per minute (normal heart rate in this patient\u2019s age group, 120 to 160 beats per minute). The low heart rates were not associated with apnea or cyanosis, and each episode resolved spontaneously. In addition, the systolic blood pressure was elevated (92 to 97 mm Hg), with equal measurements in the arms and legs. Brachial\u2013femoral delay was absent, and the results of pulse oximetry in the right hand and right foot were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and creatinine were normal, as were the results of electrocardiography, renal ultrasonography, and newborn blood-spot screening (a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism). The patient was discharged home on the seventh day of life. The patient was well until 7 weeks of age (approximately 3.5 months before the current admission), when abdominal breathing and grunting respirations developed during the night. He had consumed a smaller volume of breast milk than usual at 6 p.m., and he awakened 3 hours later but quickly fell asleep again using a pacifier, without feeding. He slept through his usual midnight feeding, and when his mother checked on him around that time, he felt warm and seemed to be breathing heavily, with pronounced movement of the abdomen with respiration. The patient awoke at 3 a.m. and avidly consumed breast milk, but he had grunting respirations and persistent abdominal breathing that prompted his mother to take him to the emergency department of a second hospital. On physical examination, the patient had tachypnea and a rectal temperature of 38.1\u00b0C. The white-cell count was 20,300 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 5500 to 18,000), the anion gap 26 millimoles per liter (reference range, 3 to 11), the blood bicarbonate level 9 mmol per liter (reference range, 21 to 32), and the blood glucose level 182 mg per deciliter (10.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 106 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.9 mmol per liter]). A blood culture was sent. The results of chest and abdominal radiography were reportedly normal. Ceftriaxone and normal saline were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to a third hospital for further treatment. On arrival at the third hospital, the patient fed without difficulty and appeared well. Vital signs and results of a physical examination were normal; the weight was 5.0 kg (39th percentile), and the length 57 cm (45th percentile) (Figure 1). Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, colorless urine with a specific gravity of 1.005 and a pH of 6.0; ketones were absent. A urine culture was sent. The patient was observed for 48 hours; during that time, he appeared well and the blood and urine cultures remained negative. On the third hospital day, the patient was discharged home. His primary care pediatrician advised avoidance of intervals longer than 6 hours between feedings.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2021The plasma specimens were grossly hemolyzed and lipemic.\u00a7The test was not performed because the specimen was markedly hemolyzed. One day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s mother called the primary care pediatrician to report the following events: when the patient awoke that morning after a 6-hour fast, he had tachypnea; he then drank a bottle of infant formula; 1 hour later, grunting respirations developed; he drank an additional ounce of formula; his ventilatory efforts normalized over the next 45 minutes; and he appeared well throughout the remainder of the day. On further recall, the patient\u2019s mother reported that there had been one other morning within the past 2 weeks during which the patient had been irritable and had had tachypnea on awakening after a 6-hour fast, with rapid resolution of these symptoms after feeding. On the day of admission, the pediatrician had a telephone consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist, who recommended elective admission of the patient to the pediatric ICU at this hospital for a diagnostic fast. On the patient\u2019s admission to the pediatric ICU, history was obtained from the patient\u2019s mother. She reported that the infant\u2019s diet had changed from breast milk to a partially hydrolyzed cow\u2019s milk\u2013based infant formula between 1 and 2 weeks earlier; the patient had also recently begun eating rice cereal. His most recent feed, which consisted of approximately 105 ml of formula, had taken place 2.5 hours before admission. There had been no concerns about the patient\u2019s growth or acquisition of developmental milestones. He had a history of a small umbilical hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included ranitidine and vitamin D; there were no known allergies. Immunizations were current. The patient lived with his parents, older sister, and pet dog, and he did not attend day care. His paternal grandmother had type 2 diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, the patient was alert, smiling, and interactive. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the pulse 136 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 7.2 kg (33rd percentile), the length 62 cm (3rd percentile), and the head circumference 41 cm (9th percentile) (Figure 1). Doll-like facies were present, with full cheeks and deep-set eyes. The abdomen was protuberant; the remainder of the examination was normal. In preparation for the planned fast, a baseline point-of-care blood glucose level was measured, with a result of 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). A whole-blood specimen was obtained for measurement of the pyruvate level, and a plasma specimen was obtained for measurement of the levels of carnitine and acylcarnitines; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Thirty minutes later, a point-of-care blood glucose level was 13 mg per deciliter (0.7 mmol per liter). A serum specimen was obtained for measurement of the levels of insulin, C-peptide, cortisol, human growth hormone, and free fatty acids. Glucagon was administered intramuscularly. Ten minutes later, a point-of-care blood glucose level was less than 10 mg per deciliter (<0.6 mmol per liter); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The respiratory rate was 58 breaths per minute, and the results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged. The fast was ended, and the patient drank 120 ml of formula; 1 hour later, the blood glucose level was 73 mg per deciliter (41 mmol per liter).

Ten months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed. During the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosiswere negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted. A diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life,\u201d with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value, <1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not detected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema. MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 5 Months before the Current Evaluation.Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the head (Panels A and B, respectively) show abnormal enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extends into the right superior orbital fissure and adjacent right middle cranial fossa (arrows). Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the cervical spine with fat suppression (Panels C and D, respectively) show abnormal pachymeningeal enhancement and thickening anteriorly in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 as well as more circumferentially with a posterior predominance at the cervicothoracic junction, with resultant variable canal stenosis and mild cord compression (arrows). A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands. On the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone. Pathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response. Repeat MRI of the head (Figure 2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Figure 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality. MRI of the Head and Spine Obtained 4 Months before the Current Evaluation.Repeat head and spinal MRI studies were obtained 2 weeks after treatment with rituximab was initiated. Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the head (Panels A and B, respectively) show increased abnormal enhancement on the right side (arrows) and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and left middle cranial fossa (arrowheads). Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the cervical spine with fat suppression (Panels C and D, respectively) show progression of the abnormal pachymeningeal enhancement with worsening canal stenosis and progressive cord compression but no cord signal abnormality (arrows). The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 week before admission, when headache, fatigue, and myalgias developed. During the next 2 days, she felt generally unwell, and the headache did not diminish with the use of acetaminophen. Five days before admission, she felt feverish, but her temperature (measured at home) was 37.8\u00b0C. The frequency of bowel movements increased from a baseline of one to three movements per day to five to eight per day; the color of the stool remained brown, but the consistency became looser, and the stool occasionally contained small amounts of mucus and blood. Two days before admission, the patient presented to her primary care physician for evaluation. The hemoglobin level was reportedly 8 g per deciliter (reference range, 12 to 16); 6 weeks earlier, the level had been 13 g per deciliter. A provisional diagnosis of a flare of Crohn\u2019s disease was made, and prednisone and intravenous fluids were administered. One day before admission, the hemoglobin level was reportedly 7 g per deciliter, and the patient was asked by her gastroenterologist to stop taking prednisone and to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing headache, fatigue, and myalgias but no dyspnea on exertion or palpitations. She had a history of infertility, and 4 weeks before admission, she had completed one cycle of intrauterine insemination after the administration of follicle-stimulating hormone. She did not become pregnant, and the last menstrual period began 2 weeks before admission, with menstrual flow that was heavier and of longer duration than the flow of previous menstrual cycles. The patient had received a diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease 9 years before admission. Two years later, cytomegalovirus colitis developed while she was receiving infliximab and azathioprine, and her treatment was changed to infliximab monotherapy. Two years before admission, she had evidence of persistent inflammation on endoscopy, and her treatment was then changed to vedolizumab. Eight weeks before admission, the frequency of the vedolizumab dose was increased after the stool calprotectin level was found to be elevated. The patient also had a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis with normal hepatic synthetic function, stable diffuse intrahepatic disease, and no evidence of a clear dominant stricture on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography performed 3 months before admission. In addition to vedolizumab, medications included cetirizine and a prenatal multivitamin with iron. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. She lived in New England, worked as an engineer, and was of Asian Indian descent. Her 3-year-old son attended day care regularly. Ten days before admission, fever and an erythematous facial rash had developed in the son; he was not evaluated by a medical provider and recovered after 2 days. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 103/66 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was alert and oriented. The sclerae were anicteric, and the conjunctivae were pale. The oropharynx appeared normal, and there was no cervical lymphadenopathy. She did not have a rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation; there was no splenomegaly. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The arms and legs did not have edema. A rectal examination revealed brown stool that tested positive for fecal occult blood. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, folate, vitamin B12, and fibrinogen were normal, as were results of kidney-function and coagulation tests. The total bilirubin level was 1.1 mg per deciliter (19 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 \u03bcmol per liter]); it had increased from a baseline level of 0.3 to 0.7 mg per deciliter (5 to 12 \u03bcmol per liter). Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.003 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035) and a pH of 6 (reference range, 5 to 9) and was negative for glucose, blood, protein, bilirubin, and urobilinogen.

The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when vomiting, diaphoresis, and increasing fatigue developed while he was traveling. The next day, the patient reportedly felt feverish and took ibuprofen and over-the-counter medications for influenza-like symptoms. During the afternoon and evening before admission, his family was unable to contact him by telephone. That night, his wife contacted emergency personnel, who went to the hotel where he was staying. They found him seated in his room, where he was nonverbal, unable to stand, but able to respond to painful stimuli. The blood pressure was 132/82 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute by nasal cannula. The pupils were 3 mm and nonreactive. The skin was warm. A capillary glucose level was 148 mg per deciliter (8.2 mmol per liter). An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 132 beats per minute. Naloxone was administered nasally, but the patient's condition did not improve. He was transported to another hospital. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 40.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 103/71 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared withdrawn and confused and thought he was in his home state of Nevada. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 on a scale of 3 (indicating coma) to 15 (indicating normal). Speech was slow. He obeyed commands. Toxicologic screening was negative. Reportedly, the hematocrit and white-cell count were normal, the platelet count was decreased, and the percentage of band forms was elevated; blood levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, and glucose were normal, the lactate level was elevated, and the bicarbonate level was decreased. Results of tests of renal and liver function were elevated. Testing for occult blood in the stool was positive. A chest radiograph was normal; computed tomographic images of the brain, abdomen, and pelvis, obtained without the administration of contrast material, reportedly showed no acute abnormality. A presumptive diagnosis of meningitis was made. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, normal saline, and diazepam were administered intravenously, and acetaminophen was given rectally. Lumbar puncture was deferred because of thrombocytopenia. An indwelling urinary catheter drained 40 ml of amber, cloudy urine. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained. The patient was transported to this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported having little recollection of the previous week. Additional history was obtained from his wife. He reported feeling \u201cawful,\u201d with diffuse muscle pain, neck stiffness, and pain with swallowing, without headache or rash. He had gout; he took no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. The patient resided in the Southwest with his wife. He owned two dogs that were healthy and vaccinated. He enjoyed gardening, had gone hunting and walking in brush in Nevada 10 days before admission, and had traveled to Ireland 1 month earlier; on the day before the onset of symptoms, he had arrived in New England for business. He reported no recent dental work and no unusual exposures, such as tick or mosquito bites. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/81 mm Hg, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing supplemental oxygen at 2 liters per minute. He was lethargic, diaphoretic, and flushed and was unable to sit up. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs, rubs, or bruits. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organomegaly. The skin was mottled, and there was a rash in a livedo pattern on the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen (Figure 1A) and a purpuric rash on the hands (Figure 1B). The hands and feet were initially cold, and the muscles were diffusely tender. On neurologic examination, the patient was oriented, but his memory of recent events was impaired. He could follow only one-step commands. Speech was fluent, without paraphasic errors. There was diffuse, generalized weakness. Deep-tendon reflexes were mute in the ankle and otherwise 1 to 2+, plantar reflexes were flexor, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Red-cell indexes and blood levels of phosphorus, magnesium, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, haptoglobin, and lactic acid were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. No intracellular or extracellular organisms were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine; the specific gravity was 1.025, and the pH 5.5, with 1+ bilirubin, 2+ albumin, and 3+ occult blood by dipstick. Examination of the sediment revealed 3 to 5 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, few bacteria, very few renal tubular cells, and amorphous crystals per high-power field and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field. Screening tests for the human immunodeficiency virus (types 1 and 2) and antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiwere negative. Four hours after his arrival, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and platelets were transfused.

Two months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospital with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1500). A chest radiograph (Figure 1A) showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac and Radiographic Studies.An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at the other hospital (Panel A) shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at this hospital (Panel C) shows mild cardiomegaly that is unchanged from that observed on the image obtained at the other hospital, with increased pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter is appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. An image from three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (Panel D) shows severe mitral regurgitation (orange-red jet and asterisk) due to a perforation at the lateral mitral-valve annulus. This image shows the \u201csurgeon\u2019s view,\u201d with the aortic valve (AV) anterior to the mitral valve (white oval) and the lateral aspect of the mitral valve on the left side of the image. Subsequently, cardiac surgery was performed. An electrocardiogram obtained postoperatively (Panel E) shows atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained postoperatively while the patient was in the supine position (Panel F) shows left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with support catheters and tubes (endotracheal and orogastric tubes, bilateral chest tubes, a mediastinal drain, the tip of a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, and a peripherally inserted central catheter) and median sternotomy wires. Bilateral costophrenic angles were not included in the field of view. No evidence of pneumothorax was observed. At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered. Blood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus(MSSA) in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital. However, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Medical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypothyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy, arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin administered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furosemide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions. The patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bicycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm. The blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albumin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Cultures of blood were obtained. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1B) showed atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block.

A chest radiograph (Figure 1C) showed bilateral pulmonary edema, which was more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, as well as pleural effusions and left atrial enlargement. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Figure 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 61%, dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery. On hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was performed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputation of the left atrial appendage. TEE performed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epinephrine (at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute), norepinephrine (10 \u03bcg per minute), and vasopressin (0.04 U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Figure 1E) showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ventricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemodynamic data are shown inTable 1. An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Figure 1F) showed left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain. Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started, and the epinephrine infusion was discontinued. On postoperative day 2, the trachea was extubated, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia occurred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg, and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%, right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (seeVideo 3).

There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis. Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed. During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm. Initial Imaging Studies.CT of the chest and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A coronal image of the chest (Panel A) shows mediastinal lymphadenopathy (arrow). An axial image of the abdomen (Panel B) shows retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (arrow). MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed image of the orbits (Panel C) shows enhancement of the irises, with greater enhancement in the right globe (arrow) than in the left globe, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3. The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive posterior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic examination (Figure 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Fundus Photographs.Fundus photographs of the right eye and the left eye (Panels A and B, respectively) show perivascular exudates (arrows) and hemorrhages (arrowheads). During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swelling but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhancement of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diagnosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis. The administration of cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was begun as empirical treatment for possible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instructed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forM. tuberculosishad been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the patient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medication to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

The patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had consumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admission, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention occurred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, intolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia. Sixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due toMycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; however, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness. The patient had not started taking metformin until 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or paternal half-siblings. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaundice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3gallop; there were no rales. The abdomen was distended, with dullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmetric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis. The blood glucose level was 402 mg per deciliter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%. The platelet count was 82,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

During pregnancy, the patient\u2019s mother was 41 years old (gravida 3, para 1) and received prenatal care at another hospital. At 7 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding occurred because of a subchorionic hematoma. At 10 weeks of gestation, the mother\u2019s blood thyrotropin level was 0.01 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00); levels of free thyroxine (free T4) and total triiodothyronine (total T3) were not obtained. At 19 weeks of gestation, the thyrotropin level was 0.44 \u03bcU per milliliter and an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy was normal. During the third trimester, gestational diabetes was diagnosed; glycemic control was maintained with dietary changes. Four weeks before delivery, at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, a routine transvaginal ultrasonographic survey of fetal growth revealed a new mass on the right side of the fetus\u2019s neck that measured 2.6 cm by 3.4 cm by 3.0 cm. The mother was referred to the obstetrics clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. At 35 weeks 6 days of gestation, obstetrical ultrasonography performed at this hospital (Figure 1A) confirmed the presence of a 4.6-cm mass on the right side of the neck. The mass was hyperechoic and well circumscribed and had internal vascularity; the remainder of the survey of fetal anatomy was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fetus, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D), revealed displacement of the trachea without compression. Prenatal Imaging Studies.Ultrasonography and MRI of the fetus were performed at 35 weeks 6 days of gestation. An ultrasound image (Panel A) shows a 4.6-cm spherical mass on the right side of the neck. T2-weighted MRIs (Panels B, C, and D) show a single fetus in the vertex position (Panel B) with a spherical mass (Panels B and C, arrows; Panel D, asterisk) on the right side of the neck and displacement of the trachea (Panel D, arrow). For multiple weeks, the fetal biophysical profile score was 8 out of 8, indicating normal breathing motion, movement, tone, and amniotic fluid volume. The mother met with providers from Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine, Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Otolaryngology, and Neonatology to discuss the plan for delivery and neonatal airway management at birth, including the possibility of an ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure. The mother initially had a preference for a vaginal delivery, given her history of a successful vaginal delivery with a previous pregnancy. However, after conversations with Maternal\u2013Fetal Medicine providers, the decision was made to proceed with a scheduled cesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks of labor dystocia and asynclitism due to fetal neck position and any associated birth trauma, as well as to allow for controlled timing of the delivery with multidisciplinary team members present. The mother had a history of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and known mutations in both copies of the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Eleven years earlier, her first pregnancy had ended at full term with a vaginal delivery. Three years earlier, her second pregnancy had ended at 13 weeks of gestation with elective termination because of the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell (a syndrome of midline abdominal and chest wall defects, including ectopia cordis and omphalocele). During her current pregnancy, she had taken prenatal vitamins, cholecalciferol, and pyridoxine, as well as lorazepam as needed for anxiety. Prenatal screening tests were negative for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis B; equivocal for immunity to rubella; and positive for group B streptococcal colonization. The patient (baby) had a healthy father and sister. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her maternal grandmother, sleep apnea in her paternal grandfather, and diabetes in her paternal grandmother. In addition, her maternal aunt had thyrotoxicosis, a paternal uncle had diabetes, and another paternal uncle had blindness, deafness, and cognitive developmental delay. At 39 weeks of gestation, the baby was delivered by cesarean section. The birth weight was 3060 g (35th percentile), the length 48 cm (26th percentile), and the head circumference 34.5 cm (60th percentile). She had a spontaneous cry, decreased tone, and spontaneous respirations. There was a large firm mass on the right side of the neck. The 1-minute Apgar score was 6. At 3 minutes of life, increased work of breathing developed; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm of water was administered. At 5 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 7 but the increased work of breathing worsened, with nasal flaring, grunting, and subcostal retractions; the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 100%. At 10 minutes of life, the Apgar score was 8. Direct laryngoscopy revealed deviation of the trachea, larynx, subglottis, and right piriform sinus. Tracheal intubation was performed with rigid bronchoscopy; because of clinically significant airway obstruction, tracheostomy was performed. At 8 hours of life, the blood hemoglobin level was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range for neonates, 13.5 to 19.5), the thyrotropin level 3.82 \u03bcU per milliliter, the alpha-fetoprotein level 107,048.0 ng per milliliter (reference range, <7.9), and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level 7.3 IU per milliliter (reference range, <50.0).

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2021The neonatal reference range for hemoglobin is 13.5 to 19.5 g per deciliter. On ultrasonography of the head and neck (Figure 2A), the mass on the right side of the neck measured 3.7 cm by 3.8 cm by 3.1 cm and was markedly hypervascular, with lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein and carotid artery. On MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the neck, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Figure 2B and 2C), the mass appeared to arise from the sympathetic chain. Postnatal Imaging Studies.An ultrasound image of the neck obtained on the first day of life (Panel A) shows a mass with relatively homogeneous echotexture (left side) and internal color Doppler flow (right side), as well as lateral displacement of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and common carotid artery (CCA). A T2-weighted MRI obtained on the sixth day of life (Panel B) shows the mass (asterisk) and mass effect involving the larynx at the level of the glottis (arrow). An MRI obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material (Panel C) shows internal enhancement of the mass, which extends from the level of the infratemporal region (top arrow) to the cervicothoracic junction (bottom arrow). During the first week of life, the vital signs remained normal, except for intermittent oxygen desaturation events while the patient was breathing through a humidified tracheostomy mask (Fio2, 21%); these desaturations resolved rapidly without intervention.

The patient was born to a 27-year-old mother (gravida 2, para 2) by spontaneous vaginal delivery at another hospital after an uncomplicated gestation of 39 weeks 4 days. His mother had received prenatal care in Nigeria and had also been seen by an obstetrician in New England for one office visit at 24 weeks 4 days of gestation. At that appointment, results of an ultrasonographic survey of the fetal anatomy were normal, and antepartum screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and syphilis were negative. A maternal test for IgG antibodies to rubella virus was positive (>500 IU per milliliter; reference range for immunity, \u22659.9), as was a test for IgG antibodies to varicella\u2013zoster virus. The maternal ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, and screening for antibodies to red cells was negative; hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed the presence of hemoglobin AS. The mother traveled back to Nigeria before returning to New England at 34 weeks of gestation in anticipation of the birth. At delivery, meconium was present. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 7 and 8, respectively. The birth weight was 3.21 kg (54th percentile), the length 51 cm (72nd percentile), and the head circumference 33.5 cm (22nd percentile). The newborn had tremulous movements of the arms and legs, and the blood glucose level was reportedly 20 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter). He was admitted to the special care nursery at the other hospital, where intravenous fluids that contained dextrose were administered and breast-feeding was initiated; the blood glucose level normalized. On examination of the newborn the following day, the vital signs were normal. Scattered petechiae were present on the face, and an eye examination revealed that the red reflex was absent in the left eye and decreased in the right eye. The platelet count was 18,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Newborn blood-spot screening tests (a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism) revealed the presence of hemoglobin FAS and were otherwise negative. On a hearing screening, no auditory brain-stem response was detected when the test sound was presented to either ear. A polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay for cytomegalovirus DNA in the urine was negative, as was a maternal rapid plasma reagin test. At 48 hours of age, the patient was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The history was obtained from the patient\u2019s mother. She reported that she was unsure whether the newborn responded to her voice or other sounds. She had received treatment for malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy and had received amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate for a respiratory tract infection during the early part of the third trimester. The family lived in an urban area of Nigeria, where the parents worked in the banking sector and employed a live-in nanny to help care for the patient\u2019s 3-year-old sister. They did not have pets and had not noted rodents or other pests in their home. The patient\u2019s mother, father, and sister were healthy. During the mother\u2019s previous pregnancy, prenatal care had taken place exclusively in Nigeria; the child had been delivered in the southeastern United States, and the mother and child had traveled back to Nigeria shortly after the birth. Otherwise, the mother had not traveled internationally; the father had traveled to China for business during the past year. On examination in the neonatal ICU, the newborn was awake and appeared well, and the vital signs were normal. Scattered petechiae were present on the face. The red reflex was absent in both eyes. A systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6) was heard in the left upper chest. Mild hepatosplenomegaly was present. Increased muscle tone was present in the arms and legs, and intermittent, suppressible, rapid shaking movements occurred in the arms. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A blood sample was obtained for culture. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered intravenously, and platelets were transfused.

Cranial ultrasonography was performed through the anterior fontanelle (Figure 1). Sagittal images showed multiple punctate, echogenic foci in the periventricular white matter bilaterally, a finding consistent with calcifications. Punctate calcifications were also present in the basal ganglia. Complex subependymal cysts were seen in the caudothalamic grooves bilaterally; these were larger on the left side than on the right side. There was mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. Linear, branching, echogenic foci were present in the basal ganglia bilaterally, a finding consistent with lenticulostriate vasculopathy. Cranial Ultrasound Images.Right and left sagittal images (Panels A and B, respectively) show multiple punctate, echogenic foci in the periventricular white matter, a finding consistent with calcifications (arrows). Additional right and left sagittal images (Panels C and D, respectively) show complex subependymal cysts in the caudothalamic grooves bilaterally that are larger on the left side than on the right side (arrows). C denotes caudate, and T thalamus. There is mild dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. An anterior coronal image (Panel E) shows linear, branching, echogenic foci in the basal ganglia bilaterally, a finding consistent with lenticulostriate vasculopathy (arrows). Intracranial calcifications in the neonate may result from a variety of conditions. Congenital infection is usually the first diagnostic consideration; other causes include hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury, neoplasm, and genetic disorders.1The pattern of calcification in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia in this patient is suggestive of congenital infection.2Subependymal cysts, which were seen in this case, may result from hemorrhage, hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury, or congenital infection.3These cysts may also result from rare metabolic and genetic disorders and may be seen in healthy newborns. Lenticulostriate vasculopathy is the presence of hyperechogenic vessels in the basal ganglia or thalami on cranial ultrasonography. This finding may be seen in healthy infants; however, it has been associated with infectious and noninfectious conditions and is most likely a nonspecific marker of perinatal brain injury.4 In this patient, chest radiography (Figure 2A) revealed a normal heart and mediastinum and clear lungs. There were thin, transverse lucent bands in the proximal humeral metaphyses bilaterally. Metaphyseal lucent bands in the neonate may result from changes associated with chronic stress or from congenital infections. Other causes of metaphyseal lucent bands include metastatic neuroblastoma and leukemia. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the finding of hepatosplenomegaly (Figure 2B). Chest Radiograph and Abdominal Ultrasound Image.A chest radiograph (Panel A) is normal except for the presence of transverse lucent bands in the proximal humeral metaphyses bilaterally (arrows). The inset shows a magnified image of the right shoulder. An abdominal ultrasound image (Panel B) confirms the finding of splenomegaly.

A diagnosis of dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy had been made when the patient was in his late 40s. When he was 48 years of age, a dual-chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months before admission, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C; andVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Transthoracic Echocardiograms.An echocardiogram was obtained 4 months before admission. Parasternal long-axis (Panel A) and short-axis (Panel B) views show dilatation but no hypertrophy in the left ventricle (LV), as well as impaired systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 40% and without pericardial effusion. The apical four-chamber view (Panel C) shows an elongated left atrium (LA), moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, an elongated right atrium (RA), and mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction; the right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 20 mm Hg. Another echocardiogram was obtained at the time of the current presentation. The parasternal long-axis (Panel D) and short-axis (Panel E) views show severe, diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, with regional variation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 13%; these findings are consistent with ischemia that is superimposed on a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Changes in the perfusion rates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were not associated with clinically significant changes in left ventricular ejection fraction or right ventricular function. The apical four-chamber view (Panel F) shows severe diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, as well as diffuse right ventricular hypokinesis, with normal right ventricular size; there is no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Several days before admission, malaise, fatigue, increasing dyspnea, and chest tightness developed. One day before admission, the patient was seen by his primary care provider. The systolic blood pressure was reportedly between 80 and 89 mm Hg, the pulse higher than 100 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 77% while he was breathing ambient air. Emergency medical services were called; on examination, the patient\u2019s mentation was normal, and the cardiac rhythm was rapid atrial fibrillation. During transport by ambulance to another hospital, ventricular tachycardia developed, and the patient became unresponsive and apneic. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun, and the trachea was intubated. In the emergency department, blood levels of magnesium and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Ventricular tachycardia was followed by transient pulseless electrical activity, with hypotension, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Oxygen, multiple external shocks, epinephrine, amiodarone, dopamine, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. After approximately 25 minutes, atrial fibrillation was restored, and the blood pressure rose to 98/20 mm Hg. Norepinephrine bitartrate, insulin, midazolam, cisatracurium, furosemide, fentanyl, vasopressin, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, heparin, and normal saline were administered. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory Data. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, regional wall-motion abnormalities, mild left ventricular dilatation, normal wall thickness, and moderate mitral regurgitation, without pericardial effusion. Chest radiographs reportedly showed increasing consolidation of the right middle and upper lobes. The patient was paralyzed, and mechanical ventilation was continued. Furosemide and chlorothiazide were administered for oliguria, and broad-spectrum antibiotic agents for presumed aspiration pneumonia; venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated for persistent hypoxemia. On the second day, the patient was transferred to this hospital and admitted to the ICU. Medications on transfer included norepinephrine, dopamine, fentanyl, midazolam, vasopressin, insulin, and cisatracurium. The patient had muscle weakness that had begun approximately 15 years earlier, when increasing weakness of his hands developed. When the patient was 40 years of age, episodes of lightheadedness occurred; a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made, and prophylactic anticoagulation with warfarin was begun. When he was 41 years of age, he noted difficulty walking (with occasional stumbling), gripping and releasing tools, and climbing stairs and ladders. Electromyography, which was performed at another hospital, reportedly revealed brief-duration, low-amplitude, polyphasic motor-unit potentials. During the next 3 years, his symptoms worsened, and his left forearm was fractured after a fall. On examination when the patient was 44 years of age, extraocular movements were normal, and mild bilateral ptosis, moderate bilateral facial weakness, and slight thinning of the temporalis muscles were present. His speech had a nasal quality, without dysarthria or tongue weakness. The muscle weakness was rated as 4 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale (which ranges from 0 [paralysis] to 5 [normal strength]) and involved the neck flexors, finger extensors, and intrinsic muscles of the hands; strength was normal in the proximal muscles of the arms. Muscle tone was normal throughout. After the patient firmly grasped the examiner\u2019s hand, he had difficulty releasing his grip quickly. Tapping of the finger extensor muscles on the dorsal forearm and on the abductor pollicis in the thenar eminence produced muscle contractions that relaxed slowly. There was slight weakness of the hip flexor muscles, normal strength in the quadriceps and hamstrings, and weakness of the dorsiflexors (MRC score, 3+) and plantar flexors (MRC score, 4) of the feet. The patient was able to point to a target with his fingertip, perform the heel\u2013knee\u2013shin test, and carry out rapid, rhythmic tapping movements with his hands and feet. Vibration sense was mildly decreased in his toes. He rose from a chair without the use of his arms and had a high-stepping gait. Deep-tendon reflexes were hypoactive in the arms and absent at the ankles. Romberg\u2019s sign was absent. Over the course of the next few years, weakness progressed. When the patient was 47 years of age, he had difficulty lifting 5-gallon buckets at work; examination reportedly revealed weakness of the neck flexors (MRC score, 4\u2212), wrist and finger extensors (MRC scores, 4), and finger flexors and distal leg muscles (MRC scores, 3+) and normal strength in the deltoid, biceps, triceps, hip flexors, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Deep-tendon reflexes were absent. The patient also had obstructive sleep apnea, sudden sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear (which had begun when he was 45 years of age and which was unresponsive to glucocorticoid therapy), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, cholelithiasis (which had required cholecystectomy), problems with ejaculation, non\u2013insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, depression, vitamin B12and vitamin D deficiencies, and episodes of pneumonia that were thought to be related to aspiration. Medications that he was taking before this acute illness included warfarin, pravastatin, pioglitazone, metformin, ketoconazole, atenolol, citalopram, furosemide, pantoprazole, and bupropion (all daily), as well as a vitamin B12supplement (monthly) and a vitamin D supplement (weekly). He reportedly had allergies to morphine, codeine, and tramadol. He was married and lived with his wife and children. He worked in a retail store. He drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke. His father and one sister had an undefined neuromuscular problem. His father had had lung cancer, and his mother uterine cancer; both died when they were in their 70s. One of his children had scoliosis and a neuromuscular disorder similar to that of the patient. On examination, the patient was sedated and paralyzed. Coarse breath sounds in the lungs and active bowel sounds were present. There was trace edema of both legs, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended. The pupils were sluggishly reactive; oculocephalic and corneal reflexes were absent. The arms and legs had minimal withdrawal and possible posturing. The blood levels of magnesium and amylase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Sodium bicarbonate, insulin, glucose solution, and furosemide were administered, and urine output increased (450 mm3of urine over a 2-hour period). A cannula was placed for distal perfusion, and ECMO was continued. A chest radiograph (Figure 2) showed bilateral diffuse consolidation that was most confluent in the left lower lung, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, bilateral layering pleural effusions, and the presence of medical devices, including a dual-chamber pacemaker and ICD and an ECMO catheter. Chest Radiograph.A chest radiograph shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette. There is bilateral diffuse consolidation that is most confluent in the left lower lung (arrow), a finding that is consistent with pulmonary edema and superimposed aspiration. A dual-chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD), an ECMO catheter (arrowhead), a Swan\u2013Ganz catheter in the right pulmonary artery, a catheter in the left internal jugular vein, an endotracheal tube, and a nasogastric tube are in place. Electroencephalography revealed alternation of low-amplitude bursts with near-complete suppression of cerebral activity. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun, without improvement in neurologic function. Overnight, multiple units of red cells and fresh-frozen plasma were transfused, and albumin was administered. Heparin, insulin, vasopressin, and norepinephrine were administered. Results of a cosyntropin stimulation test were normal.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Four weeks before the current admission, the patient lost her balance while walking and fell onto her right side. She had no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or other symptoms. She was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital and reported pain in her right arm. On examination, there were abrasions and bruising over the right elbow, with tenderness on palpation; the weight was 123 kg. The right radial pulse was normal, and sensation was intact in the arm and hand. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the right arm showed a mild transcondylar fracture of the right distal humerus. A splint was placed, and the patient was advised not to bear weight with the right arm. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for increased support with daily activities while she was recovering. Two weeks before the current admission, while the patient was staying in the skilled nursing facility, edema developed in both legs, and her weight increased by 5 kg. She attributed the weight gain to increased salt intake. Nine days before the current admission, oral metolazone was added to her diuretic regimen, and the leg edema resolved. At the time of the current admission, the patient reported nausea and abdominal cramps. She reported no fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, dysuria, flank pain, or vomiting. She had no known sick contacts. Her medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly treatment with continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. Medications included allopurinol, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, cyclobenzaprine, enoxaparin, fluticasone, glipizide, loratadine, lorazepam, metformin, metolazone, metoprolol, sertraline, spironolactone, torsemide, warfarin, and zolpidem. The last doses of metolazone, spironolactone, and torsemide were taken more than 24 hours before admission. There were no known drug allergies. Before the recent humeral fracture, the patient had been living alone in an urban area of New England; she required assistance from home health services for bathing and chores and used a walker for ambulation. She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had no recent history of travel, and her family history was unremarkable. On examination, the patient appeared well, without respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 137/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 126 kg. The oral mucous membranes were dry. The heart sounds were normal, as were the breath sounds throughout both lung fields. There was no edema in the lower legs. The right arm was in a splint. The blood level of creatinine was 7.66 mg per deciliter (677 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the level of lactic acid was 7.4 mmol per liter (67 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Urinalysis by dipstick showed a pH of 5.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0) and a specific gravity of 1.012 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), and no protein, blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, glucose, or ketones were present.

The Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel \u03b11 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls. The patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal. Two weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the patient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed minimally displaced fractures at the base of the second metatarsal and the cuboid, as well as diffuse bone demineralization. Radiographs of the Left Foot.A radiograph obtained 5 days before this admission (Panel A) shows diffuse bone demineralization and lucent lines at the base of the second metatarsal (arrow) and the cuboid (not shown) that were consistent with fractures. A repeat radiograph obtained on admission (Panel B) shows new fractures of the proximal first metatarsal (black arrow) and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (white arrows); a new crescentic osseous fragment (arrowhead) is thought to be an avulsed bone fragment. A radiograph obtained on hospital day 7 (Panel C) shows multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal (black arrow) and the medial navicular bone (white arrow); progression of bone edema is also noted. A walking cast was placed, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less interactive than usual. He had intermittent diaphoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consultation with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; during the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrostomy tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were unchanged in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission. The patient\u2019s parents also reported that 7 months before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, cannabidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, potassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as lorazepam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug allergies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Figure 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tenderness or discharge. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythematous or indurated. The walking cast was removed; there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Figure 2). Clinical Photographs.On admission, the gingivae were erythematous with bleeding (Panel A). After removal of the cast, edema and bruising of the left foot are seen (Panel B). On hospital day 8, nontender, purpuric macules are present on the fingers and hands (Panel C), as well as the arms and toes. The results of tests of liver function and kidney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus,Bordetella pertussis,B. parapertussis,Chlamydia pneumoniae, andMycoplasma pneumoniaewas negative. Stool testing forClostridium difficileantigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the second metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone. A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intravenous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to 108.1 mg per liter, thed-dimer level was 6953 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Radiography of the left foot (Figure 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Figure 3), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone edema in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intraosseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the calcaneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures.", "true_dx": "Multiple vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency.", "pred_dx": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got an 18-year-old guy with Dravet syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that causes epilepsy.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's having more frequent seizures now, so something else might be happening too.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His symptoms include swelling and bruising in his foot, and it seems like he has some bone issues going on.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, that's interesting.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The doctors did some imaging and found fractures in his foot bones, but they didn't see any breaks or injuries that would explain them.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's odd.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And then there's the swelling and warmth in his foot, plus a high white cell count and elevated CRP, suggesting inflammation or infection.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, the lab tests don't show signs of infection, and the cultures came back normal.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, what's causing this?", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, I remember reading that people with Dravet syndrome can sometimes have unusual reactions to certain medications.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Could it be related to his medication?

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when cough and nasal congestion developed and persisted, without fever or chills. He took fexofenadine hydrochloride, without improvement. Three days before the current presentation, he awoke at night with a severe coughing spell, with associated post-tussive emesis and trouble breathing. His parents took him to the emergency department of another hospital. On examination, he appeared to be in no distress; the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucosa of the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance and the uvula was midline; there was no tonsillar edema or exudate. Nasal congestion, boggy nasal mucosa, and serous effusions behind both tympanic membranes were evident. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis with the upper-airway cough syndrome (postnasal drip) was made, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and benzonatate (200 mg three times daily) were prescribed. The next day, the patient continued to cough but was able to attend school. That night, he awoke from sleep with an episode of severe coughing that lasted approximately 10 minutes and was associated with two episodes of vomiting. He returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. He reported no chest pain, fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. On examination, he appeared to be well and was not coughing; the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 151/87 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Mild nasal congestion and erythema of the posterior pharynx were present, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A presumptive diagnosis of bronchospasm was made. A dose of dexamethasone was administered for treatment of possible croup, and an albuterol inhaler was prescribed. The patient was advised to follow up with his pediatrician. During the next 2 days (a weekend), the cough persisted, without paroxysms; the night before the current presentation, the patient had two episodes of severe coughing, followed by inspirations with choking sounds. On the day of the current presentation, he attended school. His parents scheduled an appointment with his pediatrician at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for later that day. The patient reported epistaxis during his coughing episodes; his parents reported that they thought he was choking during the episodes. He did not have headaches, hearing problems, chest pain, shortness of breath other than with coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation. He had a history of elevated systolic blood pressure and a body-mass index in the 94th percentile. He took no regular medications. He was fully immunized with childhood vaccines, including five doses of diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, four doses ofHaemophilus influenzaetype B vaccine, three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, and two doses of measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella vaccine (in infancy and early childhood), as well as two doses of meningococcal vaccine (at 11 and 16 years of age), one dose of tetanus toxoid\u2013reduced diphtheria toxoid\u2013acellular pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) vaccine (at 11 years of age), and one dose of human papillomavirus vaccine (at 16 years of age); there was no documentation of pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his parents and one younger sibling and attended high school. He occasionally drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes and was not sexually active. His father had hypertension; his mother, who was receiving chemotherapy for cancer, had a dry, nonproductive cough of approximately 4 weeks\u2019 duration, which had begun before the onset of the patient\u2019s symptoms. On examination, the patient appeared to be well. The blood pressure was 140/79 mm Hg in the right arm and 119/72 mm Hg in the left arm, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the temperature 36.5\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side, and the remainder of the examination was normal. No coughing was observed during a 40-minute period.

The patient was born at another hospital to a 25-year-old mother by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a full-term uncomplicated gestation. Results of prenatal ultrasonography at 19 weeks 6 days of gestation were reportedly normal. During labor, the mother\u2019s temperature rose to 39.4\u00b0C, and meconium staining of the amniotic fluid was noted. Clindamycin and gentamicin were administered. During delivery, meconium was suctioned with a bulb syringe from the infant\u2019s nose and mouth. The baby was limp and blue, without respiratory responses or reflexes. Suctioning of the trachea below the vocal cords produced copious meconium. Positive-pressure ventilation was administered. Spontaneous respirations were noted at 2 minutes but were labored, with retractions and grunting. Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 minutes were 2, 6, and 6, respectively. The weight was 4775 g (99th percentile), the head circumference 39 cm (99th percentile), and the length 57 cm (100th percentile). The pulse was greater than 100 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Oxygen saturation at 4 minutes and 5 minutes of age was 78% and 86%, respectively, with the administration of 100% oxygen. Muscle tone improved within 30 minutes after birth. The infant was transferred to the neonatal special-care nursery while he was receiving continuous positive airway pressure. Severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia persisted; the infant was intubated, given surfactant (70 minutes after birth), and placed on mechanical ventilation. Passive cooling was initiated and then was stopped after neurologic status improved. Laboratory Data. Catheters were inserted into the umbilical artery and vein and a vein in the left hand. A blood specimen was cultured, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A bolus of normal saline was administered for hypotension. Morphine (at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram of body weight) and midazolam (at a dose of 0.05 mg per kilogram) were given for sedation because of dyssynchronous breathing and a respiratory rate of greater than 100 breaths per minute. The mean blood pressure ranged from 30 to 39 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation was 80 to 89% with the administration of 100% oxygen. Referral was made to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) transport team of this hospital. The infant was transferred by ambulance, arriving at this hospital approximately 6.5 hours after birth. During transport, the oxygen saturation was 99% with the administration of 100% oxygen. The infant\u2019s mother had previously had a miscarriage at 3 months of gestation and was otherwise well. Prenatal testing revealed that her blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening. Testing for syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, group B streptococcus colonization, hepatitis B virus, and chlamydia was negative. Her medications included iron and prenatal vitamins. She had not smoked, drunk alcohol, or used illicit drugs during the pregnancy. The maternal grandmother had had a brain aneurysm, and a maternal uncle had multiple skin tumors. There was no family history of early infant or childhood deaths, autism, or macrocephaly. The medical and family history of the child\u2019s father was not known. On initial examination, the infant was intubated and sedated but had spontaneous limb movements and was reactive to stimulation. The temperature was 35.2\u00b0C and rose when the infant was placed on an open warmer; the pulse ranged from 121 to 166 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 70 to 80 breaths per minute, with mild subcostal retractions. The head circumference was 41.5 cm (2 SD above the 98th percentile). The skin was pale, with petechiae on the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and had hypoactive bowel sounds. The left hand was edematous at the insertion site of a peripheral intravenous catheter. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. During the first day of life, boluses of intravenous fluids containing glucose were administered when blood glucose levels were between 10 mg per deciliter and 40 mg per deciliter; continuous intravenous administration of glucose was begun. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered. A chest radiograph showed pneumothorax on the right side, which was aspirated. Subsequent chest radiographs showed streaky perihilar opacities that were thought to be consistent with meconium aspiration. The temperature rose to 39.0\u00b0C; acetaminophen was administered, with improvement. The mean arterial pressure ranged from 38 to 57 mm Hg; dopamine and epinephrine were administered, and the doses were adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 45 mm Hg. Stress-dose hydrocortisone was also administered. Morphine was discontinued, and a continuous infusion of fentanyl was begun. Results of echocardiography confirmed elevation of the pulmonary-artery pressure, and therapy with inhaled nitric oxide was initiated, with improvement in oxygenation. Urine output decreased, and edema worsened. Gentamicin was discontinued because of concern about nephrotoxicity, and cefotaxime was begun. The blood levels of phosphorus and ionized calcium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Fresh-frozen plasma and irradiated, leukocyte-reduced red cells were transfused. On the fourth day, the patient remained lethargic despite the discontinuation of fentanyl and midazolam, but he had occasional spontaneous movements and a strong respiratory drive, with a respiratory rate of 36 to 56 breaths per minute. Test results are shown inTable 1. Infusions of water, glucose, and potassium chloride were administered. Urine output increased to 6 ml per kilogram per hour. Dopamine and epinephrine were tapered on the fourth day and stopped on the sixth day. The fontanelles were full but soft and not bulging. At the end of the sixth day, episodes of myoclonus occurred in response to external stimulation. A neurology consultation was obtained. Examination revealed severe eyelid edema, precluding assessment of pupils, gaze, and corneal reflexes; the face was symmetric, with normal tone. The patient moved his limbs in response to noxious stimuli. Reflexes were 3+ throughout, with clonus at both ankles (10 to 12 beats). Plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Stimulation induced fast irregular twitches in both arms and sporadically in both legs. Results of electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, which was performed continuously overnight and captured episodes of twitching, were normal. During the next 2 days, the patient remained lethargic, with intermittent clonus. On the eighth day, the anterior fontanelle was full, and there was diastasis of the sagittal suture. There was no spontaneous eye opening or tracking when the eyes were opened. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and minimally reactive. Tone was decreased, and reflexes were 4/4 throughout. Whole-body clonus developed when patellar reflexes were elicited.

The stiffness was not worse in the morning than during the rest of the day, and it did not improve throughout the day. The patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Radiographs of the hand and wrist were reportedly normal. Six days before admission, swelling and pain in both ankles developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician, and a 6-day tapering course of oral methylprednisolone was prescribed. After 4 days of methylprednisolone therapy, the joint pain had progressively worsened, and the patient had difficulty walking. She presented to this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported progressive pain in the right thumb and both ankles. She had no associated fever, chills, night sweats, or preceding trauma. There was also no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, rhinorrhea, or dysuria. She had no history of rashes, dry mouth, dry eyes, oral or nasal lesions, or other joint pain. She had a history of stroke and glaucoma, and 7 years before presentation, she had undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for menorrhagia. The patient lived in New England, worked in health care, and was widowed. She was sexually active with one male partner and had had unprotected vaginal intercourse 2 weeks before presentation. She had no pets and did not often spend time outdoors. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or illicit drugs. Medications included aspirin and atorvastatin. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the pulse 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was in no distress and appeared well. The mouth and nose were normal, with no ulcers, and the parotid glands were not enlarged. The first and second heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs. The breath sounds were normal bilaterally, with no wheezing or rhonchi. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The edge of the liver was not palpable, and the spleen was not enlarged. The patient had no rash or telangiectasias. The metacarpophalangeal joint of the right thumb was erythematous and warm, and movement and palpation of the joint caused pain. Effusion of both ankle joints was present, with associated warmth but no erythema. There was pain with dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, and inversion and on palpation of the ankle joints. The remainder of the examination of the joints was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- and renal-function tests. The white-cell count was 13,300 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the remainder of the complete blood count, including a differential count, was normal.

Ten months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5) and a white-cell count of 23,450 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with 81% lymphocytes and 4% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed. Examination of the bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[15]/46,idem,t(2;12)(p13;p13),?del(10)(p13)[3]/46,idem,del(6)(p21),add(7)(p13)[2]. On next-generation sequencing, SNaPshot analysis identified aRUNX1mutation, and gene fusion analysis was positive forBCR-ABL1e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia withBCR-ABL1was made. Initial Bone Marrow\u2013Biopsy Specimen.An initial bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen was obtained 10 months before this presentation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the specimen (Panel A) shows markedly hypercellular marrow. At higher magnification (Panel B), there are larger blasts with fine chromatin (top half) and smaller blasts with more condensed chromatin (bottom half). Induction chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone was administered, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. One month later, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed 7% blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started, and dasatinib was continued. Seven months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response.BCR-ABL1was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Five months before this presentation, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched, unrelated donor after myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post-transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia. Two months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response, noBCR-ABL1rearrangement, and full donor chimerism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months, the patient had worsening anemia, and dasatinib was stopped. Two days before this presentation, the patient noticed \u201clarge black blobs\u201d that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hospital and was transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain, flashing lights, or floaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats, areas of swelling in the neck and groin, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest, upper back, and both arms. He had a history of chronic daily migraine headaches, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, famciclovir, omeprazole, and escitalopram, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food-service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather, and hypertension in his father. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with correction, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp examination revealed few cells in the anterior chamber, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), varicella\u2013zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also negative. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombocytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Figure 2A and 2B) showed multiple new hyperintense lesions, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension, within the supratentorial and infratentorial regions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the central nervous system (CNS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures. Imaging Studies Obtained on Admission.MRI was performed on admission to this hospital. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Panels A and B) show hyperintense lesions in the right frontal gyrus and the left occipital lobe.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT was also performed; PET images were rendered in soft tissue (Panels C, E, and G) and inverted grayscale (Panels D, F, and H). Axial PET-CT images at the cervical level (Panels C and D) show FDG-avid bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Axial PET-CT images at the axillary level (Panels E and F) show FDG-avid axillary lymphadenopathy that is greater on the right side than on the left side. Axial PET-CT images at the pelvic level (Panels G and H) show FDG-avid bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) was also performed. The PET-CT scans (Figure 2C through 2H) showed moderate-to-intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical, axillary, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen. The patient was admitted to this hospital, and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The white-cell count was 21 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 61% lymphocytes, 27% neutrophils, and 3% eosinophils; the red-cell count was 16,000 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with xanthochromia present. Gram\u2019s staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells.

A diagnosis of CLL with chromosome 17p deletion was made. Approximately 21 months before this admission, the patient was seen by an oncologist at a second hospital, and he was referred to the Cancer Center of this hospital. Shortly thereafter, chest pain and dyspnea occurred. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made, and warfarin therapy was begun.

Five months before this admission, the patient underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, at this hospital, from a matched, unrelated donor after reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan. Post-transplantation complications included the engraftment syndrome with respiratory failure (leading to mechanical ventilation), hemolysis caused by ABO incompatibility, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, delirium, and fevers. An evaluation of delirium included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and lumbar puncture. The opening pressure was 34 cm of water (normal range, 10 to 20), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a red-cell count of 255 per cubic millimeter, a glucose level of 125 mg per deciliter (6.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a total protein level of 26 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and a nucleated-cell count of 28 per cubic millimeter (90% lymphocytes). Culture of the CSF was sterile, and nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus was negative. The delirium was thought to be related to medications or the engraftment syndrome, and after several days, the mental status improved. Thirty-eight days before this admission, pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and fluorescence in situ hybridization testing showed evidence of trilineage hematopoiesis and residual CLL. Thirty-five days before this admission, fever and abdominal pain developed, and the patient underwent cholecystectomy for acute gangrenous cholecystitis. Twelve days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital because of weight loss of 34 kg during the previous 4 months. A chest radiograph showed a left basilar opacity. Examination and culture of biopsy specimens obtained with the use of upper endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy showed no evidence of gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), candidiasis, or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. There was delayed gastric emptying. The patient declined parenteral and percutaneous enteral nutrition, and dronabinol therapy was initiated. During that admission, the patient had episodes of mild confusion, and fever to a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C occurred on the fourth hospital day. On the fifth hospital day, MRI of the head was performed after the administration of contrast material. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed subtle hyperintensity in the occipital sulci bilaterally. Gadolinium-enhanced axial T1-weighted images showed subtle enhancement in some of the occipital sulci. These findings could represent a subtle inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic leptomeningeal process or could be artifactual. On a coronal FLAIR image, the hippocampi appeared normal and there was a nonspecific hyperintense focus in the right corona radiata, a common finding in a patient of this age. The hippocampi also appeared normal on axial T2-weighted images and axial diffusion-weighted images. A sagittal T1-weighted image showed a low signal in the calvarial bone marrow that was most likely due to the known CLL or to a reactive change. There was no evidence of acute ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion, cortical abnormality, or brain swelling. Empirical ceftazidime, metronidazole, and fluconazole were administered, and mirtazapine therapy was begun. Blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis revealed 1+ protein, 1+ leukocyte esterase, and 1+ bacteria, and a urine culture grew fewKlebsiella pneumoniae. The fevers resolved and the confusion diminished, with some residual forgetfulness and \u201cfogginess.\u201d The patient was discharged home on the ninth hospital day. One day before this admission, the patient reportedly fell and hit his head. He was taken to the emergency department of the second hospital. On evaluation, he was awake, agitated, and confused, with generalized weakness. Haloperidol was administered. The patient was transferred to the oncology unit of this hospital. The patient had a history of treated hepatitis C virus infection, hypertension, and migraines. Medications were ibrutinib, famciclovir, sirolimus, tacrolimus, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, dronabinol, mirtazapine, olanzapine, ursodiol, nystatin suspension, omeprazole, cholecalciferol, and zinc acetate, as well as lorazepam as needed. He had no known allergies to medications. He lived with his longtime partner and worked in the entertainment industry. He had a 45-pack-year history of cigarette smoking and had quit 5 months earlier; he had previously stopped drinking alcohol after a period of heavy use of unknown duration, and he had used intranasal cocaine in the remote past. His family history was notable for breast cancer in his mother and liver cancer in his brother. He had one healthy adult child. On examination, the temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/79 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He had cachexia, appeared fatigued, and was oriented to person but not to place or time. He could not name the president of the United States or the days of the week, and he had difficulty following commands. He made inappropriate comments, reported visual hallucinations (including \u201csmoke coming out of the doctor\u2019s nose\u201d), and picked at the bedsheets. The mucous membranes were dry. There was a small amount of dried blood above his left eye and outer left ear. An ejection murmur was heard in the precordium. An intention tremor was present in each arm. Asterixis was absent. Strength was 4+/5 in both arms and 4/5 in both legs. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations, including examination of the function of cranial nerves II through XII, was normal. Blood levels of thyrotropin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and vitamin B12were normal, as was the serum osmolality; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear urine, with no nitrite or leukocyte esterase, 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and 1+ bacteria. Urine and blood samples were obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were performed.

The patient had been well until 17 months before this admission, when he began to have episodes of headache and neck pain multiple times per week after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. Fifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted. Three months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pressure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports. Two days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was 183.6 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.0. The physical examination was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home. On the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 239/162 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter (reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500), the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter (24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormalities. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute. Intravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondansetron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered. A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infusion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had played paintball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admission. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed prednisone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had participated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hypertension, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pressure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdomen was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No caf\u00e9 au lait spots were noted. The white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000), the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter (31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]), the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter (145 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1+ blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells.

Three years before this admission, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in a large hematoma across the chest and umbilicus. He was evaluated at another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, cervical spine, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, the subcutaneous tissues of the left flank, and the fat of the left retroperitoneum (Figure 1); this finding was reported to be consistent with soft-tissue contusion or hemorrhage. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home. CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis Obtained 3 Years before Admission.CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of contrast material, show subcutaneous stranding in the ventral abdominal wall (Panels A and B, arrows). Laboratory Data. Two days later, gross hematuria developed, and the patient was evaluated at the other hospital; laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. He was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of thrombocytopenia and hematuria. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the intravenous administration of contrast material (in accordance with a hematuria protocol), revealed no renal or ureteral stones, solid renal masses, or ureteral or bladder filling defects. The stranding of the anterior abdominal wall, left flank, and left retroperitoneum appeared to have been stable since the previous study had been obtained, 3 days earlier. The hematuria resolved without intervention. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed anisocytosis and polychromasia of the red cells, with occasional schistocytes, as well as a reduced number of platelets and normal-appearing white cells. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for IgG and IgM antibodies toEhrlichia chaffeensis,Anaplasma phagocytophilum,andBorrelia burgdorferiwere negative. The thrombocytopenia and anemia were attributed to large soft-tissue hematomas and hematuria, and the patient was discharged home. On follow-up evaluation 1 week after discharge, the platelet count was 242,000 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 150,000 to 400,000); 1 month after discharge, the hematocrit was 44% (normal range, 41 to 53). The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 weeks before the current admission to this hospital, when fatigue, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Four episodes of palpitations, chest tightness, and diaphoresis occurred during the 2-week period leading up to admission; they lasted less than 1 minute each, and the patient attributed them to panic attacks. Five days before this admission, fevers and night sweats developed, and the highest measured temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Three days before this admission, the patient noted an area of erythema in the posterior aspect of the right knee and bruising on both arms. One day before this admission, an episode of weakness and tunnel vision occurred while the patient was standing; he lowered himself to the ground but did not lose consciousness. Severe fatigue persisted after the episode, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. A screening test for antibodies toB. burgdorferiwas positive. Doxycycline, clindamycin, and quinine were administered, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a mild headache, which diminished after the administration of ibuprofen; there was no neck pain or photophobia. He had a history of alcohol-use disorder, peptic ulcer disease, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and anxiety. He had no history of easy bruising or bleeding, despite previous trauma, including a fall from a roof 3 years before admission. Recent medications included diazepam and citalopram. He drank alcohol occasionally in a binge pattern but had not had any during the past 2 weeks. He did not smoke cigarettes, use illicit drugs, or take herbal medications. He resided on an island in New England and worked as a restaurant cook. He noted ticks on his body several times per month and had removed a tick 2 weeks before this presentation. His mother had diabetes, and his father had hypertension. There was no family history of hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/57 mm Hg, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented and did not appear ill. The first and second heart sounds were normal, and the lungs were clear. The abdomen was not distended; bowel sounds were present, with no tenderness on palpation or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no swelling in the legs. An area of blanching erythema (6 cm in diameter) was present on the right popliteal fossa (Figure 2A); a similar lesion (5 cm in diameter) was present near the left patella. Areas of petechiae were noted in the erythematous lesions and on the left flank. Clinical Photograph and Peripheral-Blood Specimen Obtained on Admission.Panel A shows a 6-cm lesion with blanching erythema on the right popliteal fossa. Panel B shows a representative field from the initial peripheral-blood smear with evidence of normocytic red cells and thrombocytopenia and with no schistocytes; what appears to be a ring-shaped inclusion in the red cells near the neutrophil is an artifact of the slide preparation. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear (Figure 2B) revealed mostly normocytic erythrocytes, with less than 1 schistocyte per high-power field (i.e., occasional schistocytes were seen, but not in every high-power field), increased reticulocytes, no spherocytes, minor basophilic stippling, and no inclusion bodies in erythrocytes. Platelets were decreased in number but increased in size and had normal granularity. White cells appeared normal and had a normal granulation pattern. Giemsa staining of thick and thin blood smears revealed no intracellular organisms. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ blood and 2+ protein, with no glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal, and examination of the sediment revealed 20 to 50 red cells per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused; the hematocrit increased from 17.6% on admission to 22.5% (normal range, 41 to 53), and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Azithromycin and atovaquone were administered, and doxycycline was continued. On the third hospital day, the patient had the sudden onset of expressive aphasia, pronator drift of the right arm, and inability to follow complex commands. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed normal intracranial and neck vessels.

The patient had been well until 1 year before the current presentation, when diarrhea with loose, unformed stools developed; the diarrhea occurred up to six times per day and was associated with urgency and mild abdominal discomfort. During the 4 months before this presentation, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg occurred and increasing fatigue developed. He had had no fevers, and the symptoms did not worsen after he ate dairy or wheat products. He had a history of asthma and had had excision of a congenital nevus and inguinal herniorrhaphy in the past. He took no medications and was allergic to penicillin. He was of Italian and Chinese ancestry. He had no known exposure to sexually transmitted diseases or hepatitis. He was single and worked in a retail store. His late grandfather had had hypertension, and his late father had had diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, nephrolithiasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and hypertension; his brother and half siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 147/102 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, and the temperature 36.8\u00b0C. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of vitamin B12, folic acid, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, globulin, and free thyroxine (T4); other test results are shown inTable 1. Testing for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody and p24 antigen was negative, as was serologic testing for celiac disease. Laboratory Data. After the test results were received, the patient was called and was asked to return to the outpatient clinic the next day. On examination, the blood pressure was 156/91 mm Hg, the pulse was 80 beats per minute, and the temperature was normal. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antibody was positive, and testing for HBV surface antigen, core antibody, e antigen, and e antibody was negative, as was testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Examination of the stool for ova and parasites was negative, and stool cultures showed normal enteric flora and no enteric pathogens. An appointment in the gastroenterology clinic was scheduled. Three days after his first presentation, the patient noted increasing nausea and returned to the outpatient clinic. During that visit, color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild splenic enlargement, with the spleen measuring 14.3 cm in length (normal length, \u226412 cm). The liver was normal in size and echotexture. The liver vasculature (including the portal vein, hepatic veins, and vena cava) was patent and had a normal flow pattern (Figure 1). There was no free fluid in the abdomen. Abdominal Ultrasound Image.An image obtained during a color Doppler ultrasound examination of the abdomen shows normal liver echotexture and a patent portal vein. On follow-up evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, 3 weeks after the patient's initial presentation, he reported recent early satiety and \u201creddish\u201d stools (with no frank blood). He reported dry skin but no pruritus, fevers, rash, oral ulcers, joint pains, or skin lesions other than multiple nevi. He had traveled to an island off the coast of New England 10 months earlier but did not recall having any tick bites.There was no family history of liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease.

Fifteen days before the current evaluation, while the patient was undergoing extraction of carious teeth, a health care worker sustained a needlestick injury, which prompted evaluation of the patient for infections caused by bloodborne pathogens. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were not detected, but a rapid screening test for HIV antibodies was positive, as was a fourth-generation combination assay for HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. A supplemental Western blot assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-1. The plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 69,300 copies per milliliter, and the blood CD4+ T-cell count was 65 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 348 to 1456). The patient was referred to the infectious diseases clinic of this hospital for treatment. Eight days later, 1 week before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the infectious diseases clinic. He reported that he had lost approximately 18 kg during the past 2 years, that he had chronic orodental pain and a chronic cough at night, and that the skin on his forehead, cheeks, and chest was peeling. He had Crohn\u2019s disease, for which a total colectomy had been performed during childhood; he had been evaluated on multiple occasions during the past year for increased ostomy output and dehydration. He had no known history of sexually transmitted infections. Fourteen years earlier, the patient had undergone fine-needle aspiration of an enlarged lymph node on the right side of the neck. Cytologic examination of the aspirate revealed findings consistent with reactive hyperplasia, with no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. Nineteen months before the current evaluation, an excisional biopsy of a mass on the right side of the neck had been performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed an enlarged lymph node with florid follicular and paracortical hyperplasia. The patient took diazepam and had no known allergies to medications. He resided in an urban area of New England. He was retired and had previously worked for the government. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He reported that he had never had sex but that he had been assaulted in the past. His mother had had lung cancer, and his father had had congestive heart failure. On examination in the clinic, the patient appeared anxious. The vital signs were normal, and the weight was 75.7 kg; 2 years earlier, the weight had been 93.2 kg. The maxilla was edentulous, and the few remaining mandibular teeth appeared carious. The abdomen was scaphoid, with an ostomy in the right lower quadrant, and the skin on the face and chest was erythematous and peeling; the remainder of the examination was normal. The anion gap and blood levels of glucose, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, vitamin B12, folic acid, testosterone, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Topical ketoconazole\u2013based shampoo, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and a fixed-dose formulation of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide were prescribed.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. One week later, the patient returned to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up (the current evaluation) and reported that a lump had developed on the right side of his face. He had adhered to the prescribed regimen, and his appetite had increased during the past week. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the weight was 76.7 kg. At the angle of the right mandible, there was a firm, fixed, tender mass measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, with no overlying erythema or warmth. The erythema of the skin on the face and chest had decreased; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for a cell-mediated immune response toMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. Chest radiography revealed minimal linear and reticular opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula, and left lower lobe; these findings had not changed from previous examinations. A follow-up appointment was arranged for the following week. One week after this evaluation, repeat examination in the infectious diseases clinic revealed that the size of the mass on the right side of the face had increased to 1 cm in diameter. One week later, the size of the mass had increased to 1.5 cm in diameter, and numbness of the right pinna had developed. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck (Figure 1A and 1B) revealed asymmetric enlargement of the right parotid gland, with no surrounding inflammatory change. There was an ill-defined, central focus of hypoattenuation in the right parotid gland, a finding that raised concerns about a fluid collection or mass lesion. Scattered cervical lymph nodes were seen throughout the neck; these nodes were thought to be larger and more numerous than expected for an otherwise healthy 55-year-old patient but did not meet the size criteria for enlargement due to cancer. CT of the head revealed enlargement of the prepontine and premedullary cisterns and of the fourth ventricle, a finding that reflected disproportionate volume loss in the brain stem relative to the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended for further characterization of the facial mass. Imaging Studies.Coronal and axial CT scans of the neck (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained after the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast material, show asymmetric enlargement of the right parotid gland (Panel A, arrowheads) as compared with the left parotid gland (Panel A, arrow), with no surrounding inflammatory change. There is an ill-defined, central focus of hypoattenuation (Panel B, arrows) in the right parotid gland, a finding that raises concerns about an underlying fluid collection or mass lesion. An axial T1-weighted MRI of the neck (Panel C), obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, shows a large mass (arrowheads) that replaces most the deep and superficial lobes of the right parotid gland, extending through and widening the stylomandibular tunnel. A T2-weighted image (Panel D) shows a central focus of hypointense signal (arrows) that corresponds to the focus of hypoattenuation seen in Panel B. The lesion bows the external carotid artery anteriorly and abuts the posterior border of the mandibular ramus; there is no evidence of cortical erosion or abnormal signal in the marrow. A diffusion-weighted image and an apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Panels E and F, respectively) show restricted diffusion (arrows). MRI of the neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 1C through 1F). A large, multilobulated mass or confluent cluster of nodules occupied most of the deep and superficial lobes of the right parotid gland, extending through and widening the stylomandibular tunnel. There was a small rind of normal parotid parenchyma surrounding this mass. The mass had an isointense signal on T1-weighted imaging, restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging, and heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging. There was a central focus of hypointense signal on T2-weighted imaging that corresponded to the focus of hypoattenuation that had been seen on the CT scan of the neck. The maximum dimensions of the mass were 4.2 cm transverse by 3.3 cm anteroposterior by 5.6 cm craniocaudal; the parotid gland was more enlarged than it had been on the CT scan. The lesion bowed the external carotid artery anteriorly and abutted the posterior border of the mandibular ramus; there was no evidence of cortical erosion or abnormal signal in the marrow. The fat adjacent to the stylomastoid foramen was preserved, and there was no abnormal enhancement along the intratemporal segment of the right facial nerve or along the auriculotemporal nerve that would suggest perineural spread. In addition, there were multiple enlarged cervical nodes bilaterally, findings consistent with those seen on the CT scan of the neck.", "true_dx": "Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberrations.", "pred_dx": "Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 55-year-old guy who has Crohn's disease and just found out he's HIV-positive.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's already setting off some alarms because both of these can complicate things.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, he comes in with a mass on the right side of his face.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, that's concerning.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And it started after a dental procedure where someone might have accidentally stuck him with a needle.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, so we're thinking about possible infections from that incident.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He's also losing weight, has chronic oral issues, and his skin is peeling.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "These symptoms make me wonder if something systemic is happening.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and he's got a bunch of other stuff going on too, like a history of a neck mass and some weird lab results showing up positive for certain infections like VZV and hepatitis A.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This is getting interesting.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, let's look at the imaging.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The CT scan shows asymmetrical enlargement of the right parotid gland with a central focus of hypoattenuation.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That sounds like it could be a cyst or maybe even a tumor.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, the MRI shows a big mass replacing most of the parotid gland, and it's got restricted diffusion.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a clue pointing towards something like a lymphoma or maybe even a granulomatous process.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Given his HIV status, I'm leaning towards something opportunistic.", "t": 6, "c": "6", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Kaposi's sarcoma crossed my mind initially, but it usually doesn't cause a mass like this in the parotid gland.", "t": 3, "c": "13", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, how about cryptococcosis?

The patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white \u201csparkles\u201d flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became \u201cdark,\u201d such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He presented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms. On presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness. The patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not currently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease. Laboratory evaluation revealed normocytic anemia and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing masslike lesion in the left anterior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the temporal arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable. Imaging Studies.MRI of the head and orbits was performed. A coronal short-tau inversion recovery image (Panel A) and a coronal T1-weighted fat-saturated image obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel B) show enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle (arrows), which is associated with marked T2-hypointense signal (Panel A) but shows enhancement similar to that of the other extraocular muscles (Panel B). Mild enhancement and fat stranding are present in the adjacent extraconal fat. An axial three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo image (Panel C), obtained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, shows an enhancing masslike lesion (arrow) in the left anterior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. CT of abdomen and pelvis was also performed. Axial and coronal images (Panels D and E, respectively), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, show diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Panel D, arrows). An additional axial image (Panel F) shows geographic areas of heterogeneous hypoattenuation in the right lobe of the liver. Multiple small calcifications of varying shapes and sizes are shown throughout the liver (Panels E and F, arrows). In addition, coarse calcifications are shown within some of the mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Panels D and E, arrowheads). On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination, there was mild limitation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge, he took prednisone daily. During the next week, additional laboratory test results became available. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen, coccidioides antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies was negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosis.

The patient had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder, including depressive episodes, which were characterized by low motivation, low energy, a feeling of hopelessness, agoraphobia, and suicidal ideation without suicide attempts, and brief episodes, each lasting for 2 to 3 weeks, of hypomania and mania with irritable or elevated mood, labile affect, pressured speech, and a decreased need for sleep. Twelve years before this admission, she had received a diagnosis of stage IIA estrogen-receptor\u2013positive and progesterone-receptor\u2013positive, HER2/neu-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, with lymphatic-vessel invasion and isolated tumor cells in 2 of 2 lymph nodes. The patient underwent lumpectomy and adjuvant whole-breast radiation therapy. Follow-up therapy included four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and a 5-year course of tamoxifen. She had also been hospitalized three times for mania with psychotic features, including paranoia and visual hallucinations; her most recent hospitalization for mania occurred during her treatment for breast cancer, 11 years before this admission for ECT. She also had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Over the years, she had been treated with lithium, stimulants, atypical antipsychotic agents, and multiple classes of antidepressants. Six years before this admission, the patient discontinued primary care follow-up, and shortly thereafter she discontinued psychiatric care. Two years before this admission, a diagnosis of stage II non\u2013small-cell carcinoma of the right lung was made. At the time of the diagnosis, she was referred to a psychiatrist at the cancer center of this hospital. Her medications were adjusted, and her depression abated. She underwent a right upper lobectomy and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Approximately 1 year before this admission, the patient\u2019s depression and anxiety worsened. She missed multiple medical and psychiatric appointments, but she communicated with some practitioners by telephone. She agreed to undergo ECT for refractory depression and was admitted to this hospital. On admission, the patient reported sad mood, low interest, low energy, a feeling of hopelessness, and fear of leaving her home and burdening her husband. She had no hallucinations or thoughts of harming herself or others. She had asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insomnia, and the restless leg syndrome. A hip fracture had been repaired. Medications on admission included bupropion, gabapentin, modafinil, quetiapine, and sertraline, as well as inhaled albuterol, ipratropium, budesonide, and tiotropium. She was allergic to pramipexole and lithium carbonate, which caused myoclonic movements. She was married and retired, received disability assistance, and lived with her husband, who also had mental illness. Her mother had had depression and had died from myocardial infarction when she was in her 50s, her father had died from leukemia in his 50s, and her paternal grandfather had died from stomach cancer in his 60s. There was no family history of breast cancer or lung cancer. The patient smoked one to two packs of cigarettes daily and did not currently drink alcohol; she had used cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens in the distant past and had never used intravenous drugs. On examination, the blood pressure was 140/73 mm Hg, and the pulse 101 beats per minute. The temperature and respiratory rate were normal. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient\u2019s appearance was disheveled, her hygiene was fair, and she was alert and understood the reason for her hospitalization. She was easily distracted but cooperative. Her speech was rapid and occasionally loud but interruptible; she was mildly restless. Her mood was \u201csad\u201d and her affect alternated between dysphoric and mildly expansive. Her thought process was occasionally tangential but redirectable. There was no evidence of delusion or paranoia, and she did not appear to respond to internal stimuli. She had insight into her worsening depression and agreed to undergo ECT. The physical examination revealed diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. The blood urea nitrogen level was 26 mg per deciliter (9.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level was 1.31 mg per deciliter (116 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 41 ml per minute per 1.73 m2of body-surface area (reference value, \u226560). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, folic acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, and thyrotropin were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. Screening tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and p24 antigen were nonreactive. An electrocardiogram was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed to assess the status of the patient\u2019s known, treated lung cancer. Changes attributed to a lobectomy of the right lower lobe and a segmentectomy of the posterior right upper lobe for a lung cancer were noted, with no new findings or findings that were suspicious for recurrent lung cancer. However, a rim-enhancing mass was noted at the 11 o\u2019clock position in the right breast; this mass was new since the previous chest CT scan obtained 16 months earlier (Figure 1A). Mammography and ultrasonography were recommended as follow-up diagnostic procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed the day after the chest CT, revealed no evidence of an intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or acute infarction. Imaging Studies.A CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of iodinated contrast material (Panel A), shows a 14-mm rim-enhancing mass in the right breast, at the 11 o\u2019clock position. This mass was new since the previous chest CT scans (not shown). A mammogram of the right breast was obtained 2 days after discharge. The craniocaudal view (Panel B) and the mediolateral\u2013oblique view (Panel C) show a spiculated mass with architectural distortion that corresponded to the mass on the chest CT scan and was new since the previous mammogram, which had been obtained 2 years earlier (craniocaudal view, Panel D; mediolateral\u2013oblique view, Panel E). Sonography of the right breast targeted at the 11 o\u2019clock position (Panel F) confirmed the presence of a 14-mm solid mass that was highly suggestive of primary breast cancer . A mammogram of the left breast (not shown) showed only expected changes resulting from previous breast-cancer treatment, with no evidence of recurrence in that breast. The patient received six ECT treatments during her hospitalization. These treatments resulted in moderate improvement in her mood. She was discharged on the 19th hospital day. Medications on discharge were gabapentin (1200 mg at bedtime), lamotrigine (50 mg daily), modafinil (400 mg daily), and quetiapine (600 mg at bedtime), and tiotropium, ipratropium, and albuterol sulfate inhalers. After the patient was discharged from the hospital, mammography, performed on an outpatient basis, revealed an irregularly shaped mass in the right breast (Figure 1B and 1C), with spiculated margins and associated architectural distortion. This finding correlated with that of the chest CT scan and was a new finding since the patient\u2019s most recent mammogram 2 years earlier (Figure 1D and 1E). Ultrasonography of the right breast, targeted at the 11 o\u2019clock position, confirmed the presence of a solid mass, measuring 14 mm in the maximal dimension, that was highly suspicious for primary breast cancer. A core biopsy was recommended. Cytopathological specimens of breast tissue obtained by means of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration contained individual moderately enlarged atypical epithelial cells, as well as clusters of such cells. These cells had a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, irregular nuclear contours, fine chromatin, and occasional small nucleoli (Figure 2A). Mitotic figures were occasionally identifiable. The carcinoma cells were compatible with a primary breast cancer, but they could also have arisen from a metastasis of the lung carcinoma. In addition, other primary carcinomas can metastasize to the breast, including lung, bronchial, endometrial, colon, and thyroid cancers and melanoma. Breast-Biopsy Specimens.Shown is a comparison of the cytologic specimen obtained from the right breast by means of fine-needle aspiration (Panel A, Papanicolaou stain) with a specimen obtained previously from the earlier lung tumor by means of fine-needle aspiration (Panel B, Papanicolaou stain). The breast tumor shows individual malignant cells and clusters of cells with enlarged atypical epithelial cells, a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, moderately irregular nuclear contours, fine chromatin, and occasional small round nucleoli. The lung carcinoma cells are larger, and the nuclear contours are more irregular, with coarser chromatin and large, occasionally multiple and irregular nucleoli present (Panel B, arrow). These differences suggest the presence of a primary breast carcinoma rather than a secondary lung cancer. Low magnification of the lumpectomy specimen shows that the tumor is infiltrating the stroma (Panel C, upper left region) and is closely associated with expanded ducts that are involved with ductal carcinoma in situ (Panel C, arrows). Higher magnification shows the invasive tumor (Panel D, left side) adjacent to ductal carcinoma in situ (Panel D, right side) and reveals the nested clusters of the invasive tumor cells with moderate amounts of cytoplasm and enlarged atypical nuclei; the invasive tumor is cytologically similar to the ductal carcinoma in situ. In addition, the tumor shows evidence of lymphatic-vessel invasion (Panel E).", "true_dx": "Bipolar I disorder with mixed features; invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast; lung cancer.", "pred_dx": "Primary Breast Cancer", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 63-year-old woman who has a pretty complicated medical history.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's dealing with both breast cancer and lung cancer, and now there's a new mass in her breast that looks like it might be another cancer.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's definitely concerning.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's also struggling with depression and has been hospitalized several times for mania.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It sounds like she's tried a lot of different medications over the years, including lithium, which didn't work out because it caused some unpleasant side effects.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now she's undergoing electroconvulsive therapy, which seems to help with her mood a bit.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, back to the breast mass.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They found a 14-mm mass in her right breast on a CT scan, and then a mammogram and ultrasound confirmed it.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The biopsy shows atypical epithelial cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, which makes me think we're looking at a malignancy.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, these cells look different from those in her previous lung cancer, so it's possible this is a new primary breast cancer.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's consider where else these cancer cells could come from.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Lung cancer can sometimes spread to the breast, but the cells don't match up perfectly.", "t": 5, "c": "14", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, maybe it's a primary breast cancer instead?

The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 4 months before the current admission; he had been admitted to this hospital then because of dyspnea, cough, rib pain, flank pain, and one episode of hematuria that had reportedly occurred 1 week earlier. On examination, the vital signs were normal; there were rales in the bases of both lungs and a systolic ejection murmur (grade 2/6). Urinalysis showed no evidence of blood. Imaging studies that were performed during that hospitalization included chest radiography and computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. These studies revealed basilar atelectasis, changes consistent with mild congestive heart failure, and a new subpleural nodular opacity (1.3 cm in diameter) in the right middle lobe (Figure 1A). There was also bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (Figure 1B). Imaging Studies of the Chest.CT scans of the chest that were obtained 4 months before the current admission (Panels A and B) show a new nodular lesion in the right middle lobe along the major fissure (Panel A, arrow), as well as bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications, a finding that was unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (Panel B, arrow). A CT scan of the chest that was obtained on admission (Panel C) shows multiple small pulmonary nodules, findings that were unchanged from imaging studies that had been obtained 2 years earlier (arrow). One month later, an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography scan (Panel D), which was obtained at the level of the carina, shows marked FDG avidity throughout the bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow). During that admission, the patient\u2019s cough, dyspnea, and flank pain improved with supportive care. At discharge, recommendations included outpatient follow-up with CT of the chest, cytologic examination of a urine specimen, and possible cystoscopy. Four months later, on the day of the current admission, the patient was seen in a clinic affiliated with this hospital for a follow-up visit. He reported that two episodes of hematuria had occurred during the previous 2 months, with fatigue but no fevers, chills, numbness, headache, neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, trauma, or infection. He had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, mild cognitive decline, and choreiform movements. He had undergone aortic-valve replacement and repair of an aortic aneurysm 2 years earlier; he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a reportedly negative evaluation 6 years earlier. His medications included donepezil hydrochloride, citalopram, tamsulosin, ranitidine, quetiapine, aspirin, psyllium, and a multivitamin. He had no known allergies. He was born in Europe and had lived in South America for 10 years; he had immigrated to the United States when he was in his 40s. He lived with his wife and was retired after working in the construction and food industries. He maintained a low-salt and low-cholesterol diet, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier, had stopped drinking alcohol 1 month earlier, and did not use illicit drugs. His father had had asthma and a myocardial infarction at 62 years of age, his mother had had heart failure in her 70s, a brother had had a stroke in his 80s, and his son had died in his 30s because of arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; his other children were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 108/66 mm Hg, and the pulse 68 beats per minute. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a systolic murmur, grade 1/6, was heard at the left base. The remainder of the examination was unchanged from baseline. The platelet count and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.009, a pH of 5.5, and trace albumin by dipstick, and was otherwise normal. After the test results were known, the patient was advised to go the emergency department of this hospital. Laboratory Data. In the emergency department, the patient reported diffuse nonradiating lower abdominal pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He also reported severe constipation, increasing urinary frequency over a period of 1 week, decreased oral intake, weakness and fatigue of 1 month\u2019s duration, and weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 3 months. He had no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, or leg swelling. On examination, the blood pressure was 149/65 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, the temperature 36.4\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower quadrants, without rebound, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase and vitamin A were normal, and testing was negative for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies and antigen and hepatitis C virus antibodies; additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Repeat urinalysis revealed 1+ occult blood and albumin by dipstick; examination of the urinary sediment revealed 0 to 2 red cells and white cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field. The urinary sodium level was 55 mmol per liter, the creatinine level was 0.44 mg per milliliter (3890 \u03bcmol per liter), and the osmolality was 329 mOsm per kilogram of water. A chest radiograph revealed a tortuous calcified aorta, evidence of aortic-valve replacement, and no evidence of pneumonia or effusion. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 50 beats per minute; the results were otherwise unchanged from earlier tracings. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Normal saline was infused, and salmon calcitonin was administered. The calcium level decreased to 13.4 mg per deciliter (3.35 mmol per liter), at which time the ionized calcium level was 1.73 mmol per liter (6.92 mg per deciliter; reference range, 1.14 to 1.30 mmol per liter [4.56 to 5.20 mg per deciliter]). Two additional liters of saline were infused. On the second day, hemodialysis was performed, and the ionized calcium level decreased to 1.27 mmol per liter (5.08 mg per deciliter). The next day, pamidronate was administered. During the next 8 days, additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, many of which were subpleural (Figure 1C). The nodules were unchanged from imaging studies obtained 2 years earlier, and the new nodule in the right middle lobe that had been seen on the previous study had resolved. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right renal cyst (2.9 cm in diameter) and an enlarged prostate. A bone scan showed no evidence of bone metastases. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed bilateral colloid cysts but no extrathyroid nodules. A skeletal survey showed diffuse osteopenia, with lucent lesions in the calvarium and possibly the mandible, as well as subtle, indeterminate lucent lesions in the legs that raised concerns about multiple myeloma or metastatic cancer. Cytologic examination and culture of the urine were negative. On the sixth hospital day, testing for cryoproteins was negative. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen showed 7% plasma cells and an increased number of monoclonal plasma cells with kappa light chains. The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day; sodium bicarbonate was added to his previous medication regimen. Eleven days later (21 days after the current admission), at an outpatient visit, additional test results were obtained (Table 1). The next week, 1 month after the current admission,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) revealed marked FDG avidity in the mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1D). Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital because of worsening renal failure. Levels of complement (C3 and C4) were normal, and testing was negative for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, SSA (Ro), SSB (La), Sm, and RNP; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A renal biopsy was performed. Pathological examination of the renal-biopsy specimen revealed two glomeruli with global sclerosis (out of the six examined), interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy affecting 30% of the cortex. The principal finding was a focal but dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells that was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, with some histiocytes and plasma cells and without eosinophils. There were foci of tubulitis that was characterized by disruption of basement membrane by the inflammatory cells (Figure 2A). Interstitial fibrosis resulted in tubular atrophy (Figure 2B). These findings indicate chronic active tubulointerstitial nephritis. In addition, localized collections of histiocytes were present. The epithelioid character of the histiocytes, as well as their circumscription, can be described as granulomatous or as poorly formed granulomas (Figure 2C).1The glomeruli that were observed in the renal-biopsy specimen were normal apart from the global sclerosis in areas of inflammation (Figure 2D). Renal-Biopsy Specimen.Pathological examination of a renal-biopsy specimen was performed. Panel A (hematoxylin and eosin) shows foci in which the renal cortex is largely replaced with inflammation and fibrosis (some within the outline); the inflammation is lymphocytic and plasmacytic. Panel B (Masson trichrome) shows focal sclerosis (blue) and atrophic tubules (T) in areas of fibrosis. Panel C (hematoxylin and eosin) shows relatively discrete regions of granulomatous histiocytic inflammation and fibrosis (circle).

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers. Approximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient\u2019s condition was stable, she was transferred to a hospital in the United States. At the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. One week after the fall, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture was performed.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The patient had persistent weight gain and mild fatigue, which had developed 4 years before the current presentation. She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloating that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloating had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital. The patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was notable for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash. Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the southwestern United States, North and East Africa, western Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examination was normal. The eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were negative. The urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified lesions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, findings suggestive of granulomatous disease.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Before the patient could be evaluated in the dermatology clinic, his mouth ulcers and pain worsened. Four weeks before the current admission, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examination revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue (Figure 1B) and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pustules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflammation but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral biopsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patient\u2019s back was performed, and examination of the specimen revealed mild spongiosis, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchicine was prescribed, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Outpatient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged. Three days after discharge from the emergency department, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with prednisone was started, and colchicine was continued. Two weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain, the eye watering, and several skin lesions had resolved. The examination revealed extensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides, as well as two focal ulcerations, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, involving the soft palate on the left side (Figure 1C and 1D). There were multiple purple-red, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylprednisolone, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated dermatosis\u2013arthritis syndrome. Omeprazole, which the patient had taken for many years, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospital was arranged, with plans for oral and skin biopsies. One week before the current admission, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands, with mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed, as was trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis againstPneumocystis jiroveciinfection. During the next 7 days, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unresponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation. The patient\u2019s medical history included gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included methylprednisolone, colchicine, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, lorazepam, and oxycodone, as well as dexamethasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier, and he consumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a contractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother. On examination, the temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfortable, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy or joint abnormality. Skin examination revealed a slightly raised pustule, measuring 2 mm in diameter, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, each measuring 1 cm in diameter (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Chest.Images from a CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, show a prominent left supraclavicular lymph node (Panel A, arrow) and a prominent right hilar lymph node (Panel B, arrow), each measuring 1 cm in short-axis diameter.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 10 days before admission, when she reportedly had a high fever that resolved after 2 days. Six days before admission and daily thereafter, her temperature rose as high as 40.3\u00b0C, with associated chills, rigors, diffuse urticaria, and pain in the chest, low back, and knees. On the evening before admission, the temperature was reportedly 38.9\u00b0C after the administration of ibuprofen. The next afternoon, she came to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient had been using injection drugs, including heroin and cocaine, since 14 years of age and had most recently used them on the day before admission. She had participated in several addiction treatment programs in the past, including a methadone maintenance program. She had a history of HCV infection (diagnosed at 15 years of age), anxiety, axillary hyperhidrosis, cholelithiasis, and vasomotor rhinitis. She had had multiple skin abscesses on her hands, arms, legs, and back, some of which had required incision and drainage; at different times, cultures of the abscesses had grownEnterobacter cloacaeand coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 8 months earlier, a culture had grown methicillin-sensitiveStaphylococcus aureus. She also had had pneumonia, sinusitis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, back pain, and superficial thrombophlebitis of the left leg. Medications were methadone, which she had acquired herself and taken the previous day, and ibuprofen. She had received the hepatitis B vaccine in the past. She reported being allergic to buprenorphine and naloxone in combination, which had caused withdrawal symptoms in the past. She lived with a roommate and had previously been homeless. She worked with animals. She smoked cigarettes and infrequently drank alcohol. She had traveled to Mexico the previous year. Her sister had thyroid disease; her parents were well. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. The temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/58 mm Hg, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There were scattered focal crackles in the lungs. The heart sounds were normal, with an intermittent soft murmur at the left lower sternal border that was not augmented on inspiration. Inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted, as well as marks on the arms, legs, and femoral regions that were consistent with intravenous drug administration, without evidence of abscesses or infection. Both knees were warm, and there was a small effusion on the medial aspect of the right knee, with mild tenderness, normal range of motion, and no erythema. The spine was tender between the T12 and the L3 vertebrae, without paraspinal discomfort. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 109 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs showed low inspiratory volumes and multiple, bilateral, ill-defined nodular opacities, measuring up to approximately 1 cm in greatest dimension, throughout the right lung and left apex (Figure 1A). The cardiomediastinal silhouette was slightly enlarged, but there were no pleural or pericardial effusions. The findings raised concern about possible septic pulmonary embolism.1Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was recommended. Chest Imaging.A posteroanterior chest radiograph shows low inspiratory volumes and multiple ill-defined nodules in the periphery of the lungs (Panel A, arrows). A coronal multiplanar reformatted CT image of the posterior aspect of the lungs confirms several of the ill-defined peripheral nodules (Panel B, arrows); a nodule in the left upper lobe has a central cavity. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Multiple attempts at peripheral intravenous access were made, with transient success. Blood specimens were obtained for laboratory analysis. The platelet count and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were levels of sodium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, glucose, total protein, globulin, direct and total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactic acid and the plasma anion gap. Results of testing for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 6.0, trace ketones and albumin, 2+ urobilinogen, and 1+ bilirubin. Three sets of blood cultures were obtained over a 46-minute period from different sites. Laboratory Data. Ten hours after the patient\u2019s presentation to the emergency department, CT of the chest was performed without the administration of contrast material (because of difficulty obtaining intravenous access). There were multiple thick-walled nodular opacities throughout both lungs, many of which had central cavitation that was suggestive of septic emboli,2as well as more confluent consolidative opacities in the dependent right lower lobe. The largest opacity measured 3.7 cm by 2.3 cm and was located in the right upper lobe along the major fissure. There was also bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 1B). Methadone was administered orally. Twelve hours after the patient\u2019s presentation, an intravenous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Cefepime, vancomycin, normal saline, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously.

Diarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydrolyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not abate. Allergy skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative. When the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea persisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal microvillous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal. Renal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement membrane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission electron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a working diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started. Diarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth resumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recurrent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year. When the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing forClostridioides difficiletoxin, and examination of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun. After several months, treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy. Beginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and nephropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained. Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Figure 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum. Small-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.On hematoxylin and eosin staining, a specimen of duodenal mucosa obtained 6 years before this presentation (Panel A) shows marked villous blunting (arrows) and lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria. A specimen of duodenal mucosa obtained at presentation (Panels B and C) shows marked villous blunting (Panel B, arrows), lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (Panels B and C, asterisks). A specimen of ileal mucosa obtained at presentation (Panel D) shows findings similar to those observed in the duodenum, with mild villous blunting (arrows), lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (asterisks). Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was begun, and diarrhea abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Four years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen again revealed evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. In the gastroenterology clinic, additional history was obtained. There was a history of hypertension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adulthood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten. Current medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower abdomen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consistent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon. Biopsy specimens were obtained.

The patient was monitored thereafter with serial MRI. On the current evaluation, the patient reported persistent fatigue and mild problems with short-term memory that had not changed over time, with no seizures. On further questioning, she reported that 17 years earlier, 5 years before she received the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, she had had a traumatic subdural hematoma that required evacuation, followed by a brief episode of arm and leg weakness and difficulty speaking.

Approximately 4 years before this evaluation, the patient had undergone an unspecified hand surgery. Immediately after the procedure, hydromorphone was administered. After the patient was discharged home, he initially sought out more prescription opioids and then switched to intravenous heroin because he found it to be less expensive and more easily obtained. During the next 3 years, he injected 1 to 2 g of heroin each day. One year before this evaluation, after the patient lost his job, he attempted to quit using heroin. He began to take methadone, which helped to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, but he stopped taking it after 10 days because he was concerned that weaning off methadone after a period of maintenance treatment would be associated with unacceptable adverse effects. He then resumed heroin use. Six months before this evaluation, the patient again stopped using heroin and was admitted to an inpatient, medically supervised detoxification program for management of withdrawal symptoms. After 2 weeks, he was discharged home. Approximately 2 months before this evaluation, the patient was released from jail and was admitted to a structured residential rehabilitation program, in which he participated in work therapy, attended regular Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and underwent random, intermittent urine toxicology screenings. He continued in this program and abstained from opioid use until 3 days before this evaluation, when he resumed intravenous heroin use. He obtained the drug, which he believed to be mixed with fentanyl, from a single dealer and began to inject 0.5 g at a time using clean needles and cotton filters. On the day of this evaluation, the patient injected 0.5 g at 10 a.m., followed by another 0.5 g at approximately 1:30 p.m.; he remembered subsequently walking around a park and placing a phone call to a friend to arrange a meeting. At 2:44 p.m. on the day of this evaluation, emergency medical services personnel were dispatched to the park, where the patient was found lying on the ground in a puddle of slush. He was unresponsive. The patient\u2019s friend was present and reported that when he had found the patient, he had administered intranasal naloxone and then called for emergency medical assistance. First responders from the fire department had administered a second dose of intranasal naloxone before emergency medical services personnel arrived. On examination, the patient appeared cyanotic, and he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 (on a scale ranging from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating lower levels of consciousness). The temperature was 35.6\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 4 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 80% while he was breathing ambient air. He had pinpoint pupils and shallow breathing. An oropharyngeal airway was placed, and positive-pressure ventilation was initiated with the use of a bag\u2013valve\u2013mask device. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 164 mg per deciliter (9.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Several minutes later, the patient woke up, removed the oropharyngeal airway, and was noted to be alert and oriented, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported that the overdose was unintentional, that he had never had an overdose before, that this incident was a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d and that he wanted help with managing his opioid addiction. He had been feeling sad after the recent deaths of his mother and grandmother, and he thought that his relapse in opioid use might have been related to these stressors. He had no history of other medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known allergies. He was a high-school graduate and had worked as an electrician before he became unemployed. He was single and had no children. He had smoked a half-pack of cigarettes daily for the past 4 years and had smoked marijuana when he was younger. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs other than heroin. There was no family history of depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, or suicide. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented. His clothes were wet. The temperature was 35.9\u00b0C, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. There were scattered focal crackles in the lungs, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, the anion gap, and results of renal-function tests. The blood glucose level was 165 mg per deciliter (9.2 mmol per liter). Venous blood gas measurements, which were obtained while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, included a pH of 7.29 (reference range, 7.30 to 7.40), a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 68 mm Hg (reference range, 38 to 50), a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 28 mm Hg (reference range, 35 to 50), a bicarbonate level of 32 mmol per liter (reference range, 24 to 30), and a base excess of 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 3.0). An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and was otherwise normal.

The shaking movements ceased quickly, but he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services personnel arrived after approximately 4 minutes, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. The heart rhythm was identified as ventricular fibrillation; four shocks were delivered, and the patient received intravenous naloxone, amiodarone, and a bolus of epinephrine followed by a continuous infusion. A slow, wide-complex heart rhythm with a rate of 40 beats per minute was noted, reportedly with concurrent return of mental status, but CPR had to be resumed after pulselessness recurred. The patient arrived at this hospital 30 minutes after the initial arrest. The patient was an unresponsive, middle-aged man who had undergone mechanical CPR and had no external signs of trauma. Empirical intravenous calcium chloride, dextrose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. In addition, vasopressin, norepinephrine, rocuronium, and ketamine were administered intravenously, and aspirin was administered rectally. Emergency intubation of the trachea was performed, and an orogastric tube, a femoral arterial catheter, and a femoral central venous catheter were placed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure 1A) showed uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular contractions; possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\u2021The blood sample was grossly hemolyzed. The neurology service was consulted. A repeat examination, performed after the medications used for sedation were discontinued, revealed anisocoria and sluggishly reactive pupils (the left was 7 mm in diameter, and the right was 5 mm); corneal reflexes and response to noxious stimuli were absent. Therapeutic hypothermia was not initiated. Computed tomography of the head (Figure 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed preservation of differentiation between gray and white matter, without evidence of territorial infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a transaortic percutaneous ventricular assist device was placed through the femoral artery, and thereafter, the patient was weaned from epinephrine and norepinephrine. Coronary angiography (Figure 1D and 1E) revealed only minimal luminal irregularities (seeVideos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Subsequent catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 27 mm Hg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation was 85%. Additional laboratory test results returned during the catheterization procedure (Table 1) were notable for a blood potassium level of 2.0 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.4 to 5.0). The patient received 60 mmol of enteral potassium chloride and 80 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride. Three hours after the patient arrived at this hospital, he was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), whereupon limited additional history was available from family and friends. There was no history of chest pain, dyspnea, or symptoms of heart failure or dysrhythmia. He had a poor diet, consisting primarily of several packages of candy daily; 3 weeks earlier, he had switched the type of candy he was eating. He had no sick contacts, fever or chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Medical history included previous heroin use disorder and untreated hepatitis C virus infection. The patient had never had any adverse drug reactions. He worked in construction. He did not drink alcohol, he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 36 years, and he had reportedly been abstinent from opiates for the previous 3 years. There was no family history of cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic, or endocrine disease. The temperature was 34.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 81/53 mm Hg (on the percutaneous ventricular assist device), and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.50; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal volume, 450 ml). On examination, he was unresponsive; the pupils remained sluggishly reactive and asymmetric. No cough or gag was noted, and corneal reflexes remained absent. There were no lacerations on the tongue. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and intermittently irregular, but no murmur was noted. The skin was warm, without rashes or bruises. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, amylase, lipase, and carboxyhemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Potassium chloride (at a dose of 40 mmol) was administered intravenously. An ECG (Figure 2A) showed sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicular block and left bundle-branch block, as well as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. Additional Cardiac and Imaging Studies.An ECG obtained on the patient\u2019s arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) (Panel A) shows sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicular block (white arrow) and left bundle-branch block (black arrow), as well as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. A portable chest radiograph (Panel B) shows appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube, the pulmonary-artery catheter, and the percutaneous ventricular assist device. The lungs are clear, and the cardiac silhouette is normal in size. A transthoracic echocardiogram (subcostal view) (Panel C) shows normal left ventricular size (asterisk) but biventricular dysfunction. The plus sign denotes the right ventricle. The percutaneous ventricular assist device (white arrow) is in an appropriate position, and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion. A repeat ECG obtained in the cardiac ICU (Panel D) shows sinus tachycardia with a normal QRS duration, ventricular ectopic beat (white arrow), nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, U waves (black arrows), and QTc prolongation.", "true_dx": "Pseudohyperaldosteronism suggestive of excessive licorice consumption complicated by cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibrillation.", "pred_dx": "Digoxin Toxicity", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "## Thinking", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 54-year-old guy who suddenly collapsed in a fast-food place.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's pretty alarming.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "He went into ventricular fibrillation, which is a really serious heart rhythm problem.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Luckily, they managed to shock him back, but then things didn't go smoothly.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "His heart rhythm was still off, and he needed more help to keep it stable.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, looking at the ECGs, I see some weird stuff.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "There's a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm with a wide QRS complex and some extra beats coming from the ventricles.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Plus, there are these ST segment changes and U waves.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "These are clues pointing towards something affecting the heart muscle itself, maybe ischemia or even a toxin.", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, the coronary angiography doesn't show any big blockages, so it's probably not just a blocked artery causing this.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, let's consider what else might be going on.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "The guy has a history of heroin use, but he hasn't used it recently.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, it's unlikely to be an opioid overdose.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And there's no mention of any toxins in his system.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "What about his lifestyle?

On the morning of this presentation, the patient was found unresponsive in her bedroom. Her mother called emergency medical services (EMS) at 8:45 a.m. and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which was continued by first responders from the fire department on their arrival. The cardiac rhythm was assessed with an automated external defibrillator, and a shock was delivered. EMS personnel who could provide advanced life support arrived at 8:54 a.m. and found the patient to be pulseless. CPR was continued, and intraosseous access was established. Electrocardiography performed with an external monitor and defibrillator reportedly revealed wide-complex bradycardia. CPR was continued, the trachea was intubated, and sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and calcium chloride were administered intraosseously. Spontaneous circulation returned. While the patient was being transported from her home to the ambulance, pulselessness recurred. CPR was resumed, and epinephrine was administered; a pulse was restored. At 9:16 a.m., the pulse was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 66/30 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 7 breaths per minute. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and a bolus of normal saline was administered; thereafter, the blood pressure was 54/24 mm Hg. A continuous infusion of dopamine was begun, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving at 9:38 a.m. On the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, the available history was limited. The patient\u2019s mother reported that the patient drank alcohol in a binge pattern and had appeared to be intoxicated the previous evening but had seemed well at 7:45 a.m., before she went into her bedroom. The patient also smoked cigarettes and had a history of depression, anxiety, substance use disorder (including the use of alcohol, opioids, and cocaine), and skin abscesses due to methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus. Current medications were unknown; a review of the electronic medical record revealed an allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her mother, daughter, and cousin. She was unemployed. On examination, the patient was obtunded and did not respond to noxious stimulation. The temperature was 35.9\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pressure 60/24 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving full mechanical ventilatory support (fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.00). The pupils were 6 mm in diameter and nonreactive to light. Corneal, oculocephalic, cough, and gag reflexes were absent. There were no spontaneous breaths over the ventilated breaths; breath sounds were equal in both lungs. Electrocardiography was performed. The electrocardiogram (Figure 1) was notable for an irregular, wide-complex rhythm, with a QRS width of up to 220 msec. The differential diagnosis for a QRS complex of this width includes direct ventricular activation (ventricular tachycardia and pre-excitation), aberrant ventricular conduction, intramyocardial delay, severe cardiomyopathy, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities (including hyperkalemia), and toxic effects of drugs. The QRS complex had a broad positive R wave in lead V1, which is a morphologic feature resembling a right bundle-branch block. Other notable features of this QRS complex included a far rightward (\u201cnorthwest\u201d) frontal-plane axis, as well as a positive R wave in lead aVR, an abnormal finding that may indicate ventricular tachycardia, lead misplacement, dextrocardia, or certain toxidromes. The electrocardiogram also showed substantial prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval, even after accounting for the effect of the wide QRS complex. Initial Electrocardiogram.The electrocardiogram obtained on presentation shows an irregular, wide-complex rhythm, with a QRS width of 220 msec. It also shows a broad positive R wave in lead V1, which is a morphologic feature resembling a right bundle-branch block, as well as a positive R wave in lead aVR (asterisk). The frontal-plane axis is deviated far rightward (\u201cnorthwest\u201d), as indicated by the negative QRS deflection in leads I and aVF (arrowheads). The underlying rhythm is unclear because there is no visible underlying regular atrial activity. The following findings could be consistent with a ventricular origin of the rhythm: a possible fusion or capture beat (arrow), the absolute width of the QRS complex, the northwest axis, and the positive R wave in lead aVR (R-wave height, 5 mm; R/S ratio, 1.0). There is no precordial concordance or obvious atrioventricular dissociation. Finally, the electrocardiogram shows substantial prolongation of the corrected QT interval, even after accounting for the effect of the wide QRS complex. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Additional history was obtained, and a diagnosis and management decisions were made.

Harris(Pediatric Surgery): A 9-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of loss of consciousness and seizures. The patient had had recent inguinal pain and swelling but had been otherwise well until the morning of admission, in early autumn, when she fell down one stair at home and struck her head. A hematoma developed on the right side of the forehead, without loss of consciousness or other injury. Shortly thereafter, she ate breakfast and then attended a previously scheduled appointment in the outpatient surgery clinic of this hospital to evaluate inguinal pain and swelling on the left side that had lasted for approximately 3 weeks and was near the site of an inguinal herniorrhaphy that had been performed 9 months earlier. On examination, there was mildly tender lymphadenopathy inferior to the left inguinal crease, with a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes. There were no findings suggestive of cellulitis. Ultrasound studies were scheduled for the next day. Shortly after the patient visited the clinic, approximately 2 hours after she fell down the stair, she fell again from a standing position to the ground at a shopping mall, hitting her head a second time. The patient\u2019s mother reported that the patient was on the ground, moaning, and \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d and that she had tonic\u2013clonic movements, with both arms flexed and both feet extended. The patient also had urinary incontinence and one episode of vomiting. The movements resolved within 30 to 60 seconds. Emergency medical services were called. On examination, the patient was in a supine position, crying, and drifting in and out of consciousness. The pulse was 120 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The pupils were sluggishly reactive. The patient had spontaneous movement of all limbs, with posturing movements such as bilateral arm retractions to her chest and foot inversions. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 liters per minute through a nonrebreather mask, a cervical collar was applied, and she was placed on a backboard and transported by ambulance to this hospital. During transport, one episode of vomiting occurred. The capillary blood glucose level was 108 mg per deciliter, and cardiac monitoring revealed sinus tachycardia without ectopy. She arrived at the emergency department 40 minutes after the second fall. The history was obtained from the patient\u2019s mother. The patient was born after a full-term gestation, had had normal growth and development, and was right-handed. She had undergone bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphies 9 months earlier. Three weeks before this admission, after returning from a 2-month visit to Puerto Rico, the patient reported discomfort and swelling in the left inguinal region. Her pediatrician prescribed a course of amoxicillin, which she began taking 9 days before this admission; the prescription was changed to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid after 2 days and then stopped 2 days later by the patient\u2019s mother because of lack of improvement and possible facial swelling. The patient had received all routine childhood vaccinations, took no other medications, and had no other known allergies. She was born in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States with her mother at 4 years of age. She lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in an urban area and was a student. She returned to Puerto Rico in the summers to visit her father. During the most recent visit, she was exposed to mosquitoes, stray kittens, and a pet dog. Her father had hypertension, and other relatives had asthma; there was no family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases. On examination, the patient had incomprehensible speech, was intermittently moaning, and did not follow commands; she had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 on a scale of 3 to 15 (with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness). The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 71/51 mm Hg, the pulse 95 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation ranged from 97% to 100% while she was breathing ambient air. There was a hematoma (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) on the forehead and facial abrasions on the right side. The pupils were round, equal, and sluggishly reactive to light, decreasing from 4 mm to 3 mm in diameter. The patient opened her eyes and had spontaneous movement of her arms and legs, with intermittent diffuse posturing movements. On passive movement, there was more rigidity on the right side than on the left. The left inguinal area contained two palpable lymph nodes (5 mm in diameter) and a 2-mm punctate lesion superficial to one of the lymph nodes, without overlying warmth, erythema, or fluctuance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count was 14,000 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500), the blood level of potassium was 3.2 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 4.8), the phosphorus level was 3.5 mg per deciliter (reference range, 4.5 to 5.5), and the glucose level was 134 mg per deciliter (reference range, 70 to 110). The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell differential count, platelet count, and anion gap were normal, as were blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, amylase, and lipase and results of renal- and liver-function tests. Screening of the blood for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 134 beats per minute. Diazepam was administered, and the posturing movements transiently resolved; the blood pressure increased to 125/84 mm Hg. Computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine and head was performed. CT of the cervical spine, performed with a cervical collar in place, revealed straightening of the normal cervical lordosis and no acute osseous injury. CT of the head revealed a small subgaleal hematoma adjacent to the right frontal bone, without evidence of an underlying fracture. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. A small arachnoid cyst was seen in the right middle cranial fossa. Ms. Harris:Approximately 40 minutes after arrival, the patient became less responsive and posturing movements were present. The blood pressure was 119/88 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation decreased to 84% while she was breathing ambient air. On examination without the cervical collar, the neck was supple. Vomitus was suctioned from the airway, and high-flow oxygen was administered. Etomidate and rocuronium bromide were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Three hours after arrival in the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. MRI of the head revealed restricted diffusion involving the cortex of the right temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, right superior and inferior parietal lobule, and right cingulate gyrus, as well as the right insula and right thalamus (Figure 1A and 1B); fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed hyperintense signal and mild mass effect related to gyral swelling. Given the patient\u2019s recent seizure activity, these findings are consistent with excitotoxicity. In a patient with seizure activity, signal abnormality and contrast enhancement due to disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier can be observed on MRI and are typically transient. In this case, T1-weighted images that were obtained after the administration of contrast material showed no abnormal enhancement (Figure 1C). Three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circulation revealed increased flow-related enhancement of the right middle cerebral artery, the right posterior cerebral artery, and their branches (Figure 1D) that was due to marked hyperemia on the side of the epileptic focus. Findings associated with hyperemia can also be observed on perfusion imaging. Because seizure-related MRI findings are usually transient, follow-up imaging can be helpful to differentiate abnormalities due to seizures from those due to other causes. MRI and Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Head.MRI of the head was performed on admission. An axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel A) and apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Panel B) show restricted diffusion of the right insula (thin arrow), the right thalamus (arrowhead), and the cortex of the right temporal lobe (thick arrow) and right occipital lobe, with associated mild gyral swelling. An axial T1-weighted image (Panel C), obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows no abnormal enhancement. Mild swelling of the right frontal soft tissues, which is related to the patient\u2019s recent falls, was noted incidentally. A maximum-intensity-projection image (Panel D) was obtained from three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circulation. The image shows increased flow-related enhancement of the right middle cerebral artery (arrow), the right posterior cerebral artery (arrowhead), and their branches, as compared with the contralateral arteries; in a patient with seizure activity, these findings are consistent with hyperemia. The MRI findings could be explained by the patient\u2019s recent seizure activity, but the differential diagnosis for these findings also includes MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes), an inherited disorder of intracellular energy production that causes seizures and strokelike cortical lesions that cross vascular territories. Although the findings on imaging, including the pattern of involvement and the absence of contrast enhancement, argue against an infectious cause, infectious causes should also be considered. Ms. Harris:Levetiracetam was administered. Electroencephalography (EEG) followed by 24-hour EEG monitoring revealed continuous generalized background slowing in the delta and theta ranges, frequent intermittent focal delta-range slowing over the right hemisphere (with maximal slowing at times over the right anterior quadrant or right temporal region), and frequent sharp waves in the right frontotemporal region. Seven hours after the patient\u2019s arrival, lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed clear, colorless fluid, with a glucose level of 92 mg per deciliter (reference range, 50 to 75) and a total protein level of 33 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), as well as 5 red cells per cubic millimeter and no white cells, other nucleated cells, or xanthochromia. Gram\u2019s staining revealed very few neutrophils and mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF were obtained.

The patient's girlfriend reported that the patient had been sober for approximately 20 months, until he lost his job. Three days before admission, he began drinking alcohol and taking \u201cbath salts\u201d (psychoactive drugs) intranasally after having had no sleep and minimal oral intake. The night before admission, increasing agitation developed and was associated with apparent auditory and visual hallucinations that people were trying to harm him. On the morning of admission, shortly after snorting more bath salts, he ran outside unclothed, shouting that someone was trying to strangle him. His girlfriend called the police, who found him running naked in the street. When emergency medical services personnel arrived, they found him restrained by police officers, combative, and confused, with nonsensical, paranoid, and rambling speech. The pulse was 157 beats per minute, with bounding radial pulses, and the respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. The pupils were 5 mm in diameter. The skin was flushed, warm, and diaphoretic. A capillary glucose level was 268 mg per deciliter (14.9 mmol per liter). Soft restraints were applied, and oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital. En route, he suddenly became quiet, and a seizure was suspected. The administration of midazolam was attempted, but the patient pulled out the intravenous catheter. On arrival, the patient was unable to communicate. His history was obtained from his girlfriend. He had a history of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse (including heroin, cocaine, and prescription opiates). His only medication was fluoxetine, which he reportedly had not taken for 2 weeks. He was allergic to shellfish and had no known allergies to medications. He smoked cigarettes. He lived with his girlfriend and had recently lost his job at a service station. He had a family history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. On examination, the patient was agitated, flailing his arms and legs, jerking his head, and making loud incomprehensible sounds. He was unable to cooperate during the examination and required restraining by several security officers. The temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/67 mm Hg, the pulse 173 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The skin was diaphoretic. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; the gaze was deviated upward, with slow, horizontal ocular movements. The patient's speech was rapid and mostly unintelligible, but he made references to attacking and being attacked by animals, people, and monsters. The remainder of the examination was normal. The prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and results of liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine with a specific gravity greater than 1.030, a pH of 5.5, 2+ occult blood, 1+ albumin, and trace ketones by dipstick. There were 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, few squamous cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field and few bacteria and 3 to 5 hyaline and granular casts per low-power field; mucin was present. Urinalysis was otherwise normal. The urine creatinine level was 3.50 mg per milliliter. Laboratory Data. The patient was restrained, and midazolam was administered intravenously, followed by lorazepam, but his condition did not improve. Etomidate and rocuronium were administered, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun, followed by sedation with propofol. A urinary catheter and an esophagogastric tube were inserted. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and the correct placement of the endotracheal and gastric tubes; changes consistent with pulmonary edema or pneumothorax were not observed. A computed tomographic scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or mass lesion. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 113 beats per minute, with inverted T waves in the inferior leads and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities in the lateral leads. Fomepizole, sodium thiosulfate, sodium bicarbonate, normal saline, and potassium chloride were administered intravenously, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.

The evening before this presentation, the patient was observed by her neighbor to be sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle in her driveway. The following morning, she remained seated in the same position and was found to be unresponsive; the neighbor attempted to wake her but could not. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, intranasal naloxone was administered but did not have any effect on her mental status. The patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was unable to provide any history. She did not open her eyes but moaned in response to tactile stimulation and withdrew her arms and legs in response to noxious stimulation. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and reactive to light. Corneal, oculocephalic, and gag reflexes were present. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric in the arms and absent in the legs; the Babinski sign was present bilaterally. A pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was in place. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level was 321 mg per deciliter (17.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, albumin, lactate, ammonia, troponin, thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin were normal, as were results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of more than 1.030 and the presence of protein, glucose, and ketones. Urine and blood toxicologic screening was negative. The insulin pump was interrogated, and there had been no hypoglycemic episodes in the preceding week. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed subtle, symmetric increased attenuation in the basal ganglia, thalami, and dentate nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed extensive signal loss in the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and leptomeningeal surfaces on gradient echo images. A lumbar puncture was performed; results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown inTable 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare neutrophils with no organisms. Cultures were performed. Tests of the CSF for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 DNA and syphilis were negative, as was examination of a smear for acid-fast bacilli. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed rare atypical cells. Electroencephalography showed generalized slowing without epileptiform activity. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered. During the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 48 hours previously showed no growth. The patient was transferred by ambulance to the neurology ICU of this hospital for further evaluation. On arrival at this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and additional history was obtained from her medical records. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus had been made when she was 19 years of age, and the disease had been complicated by diabetic retinopathy. Other medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (for which she had undergone lumpectomy), chronic anemia, asthma, and arthritis due to Lyme disease. Medications included rituximab administered every 3 months for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, subcutaneous insulin infusion, and inhaled budesonide and albuterol; letrozole had been prescribed, but the patient had not taken the medication for the preceding 3 months. The patient had allergies to penicillin, cephalexin, and ciprofloxacin. She lived with her adult daughter in a suburban community in New England; her husband had died of renal cell carcinoma 4 years earlier. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had had a history of hypertension and essential thrombocytosis, and her father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus. A maternal aunt had died of breast cancer at an unknown age, and another maternal aunt had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the patient opened her eyes and moaned in response to sternal rub and showed purposeful movement toward changing painful stimuli. Her pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light. She blinked appropriately in response to confrontational threat in all fields. The oculocephalic reflex was present, and her face appeared symmetric. The remainder of the evaluation was normal. Blood levels of cobalamin and cortisol were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. On a repeat lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was 14 cm of water; other results are shown inTable 1. Tests of the CSF for Lyme disease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were performed. Repeat MRI of the head confirmed the presence of diffuse, symmetric hypointensity on T2-weighted images and showed abnormal susceptibility signal throughout the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and cortical surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted images (Figure 1). MRI of the Head.Axial susceptibility-weighted images (Panels A and B) show extensive areas of decreased signal in the deep gray matter and leptomeninges, as compared with findings on similar images from an age-matched control (Panels C and D). Electroencephalography showed generalized polymorphic theta slowing in the background and frequent, prolonged runs of bifrontal irregular delta activity with embedded bifrontal low-amplitude blunt discharges. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were continued, and meropenem was administered intravenously. During the next 3 days, the patient began to open her eyes spontaneously, move her arms and legs independently, and follow commands intermittently. Increased tone was noted in the legs and arms. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 72 hours previously showed no growth. The CSF tests for Lyme disease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were negative. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were discontinued, and the patient was transferred from the ICU to the neurology unit. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s neighbors, outpatient endocrinologist, and family. Two years before this presentation, the patient\u2019s neighbors had noted the development of suspicious and paranoid beliefs. For example, the patient believed that her computer was being used to spy on her and gather personal information, and she repeatedly asked them to help fix the device. Approximately 21 months before this presentation, the patient\u2019s endocrinologist had noted the development of confusion. The patient began to contact her physician\u2019s office repeatedly, often several times daily. Whereas she had previously managed her diabetes with a high degree of sophistication, she began to ask questions that suggested she was having difficulty with basic diabetes management. Her telephone calls contained many unrelated and, at times, nonsensical questions; emails were similarly tangential and incoherent. When she was asked about these changes, the patient reported that her cognitive function was as \u201csharp as a tack\u201d and that her emails were confusing because of \u201cslow Internet speed.\u201d During an office visit with her endocrinologist, the Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function; points were deducted because the patient had made errors of short-term object recall, attention, and calculation. The patient was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic of the other hospital for further evaluation, but she did not attend the scheduled visit. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s family had noted that she had sent individualized holiday gifts to incorrect family members. In the accompanying holiday cards, her penmanship, which had previously been neat, was nearly illegible and was likened by family members to a child\u2019s handwriting.", "true_dx": "Aceruloplasminemia, hereditary.", "pred_dx": "CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease)", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, so we've got a 59-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes who's come into the ICU after being found unresponsive in her car.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's pretty alarming.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's see what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Her blood sugar is really high, like 321 mg/dL, which is way above the normal range.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But they tried naloxone, which didn't work, so it's probably not an opioid overdose.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, what else?

The patient had been well until she was 11 months 12 days of age, when intermittent vomiting developed. On the fourth day of symptoms, she was seen by a pediatrician. The stools were reportedly soft but formed, with no diarrhea. A diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis was made, and dietary changes were advised. The patient returned home, and the symptoms resolved. On routine examination when she was 12 months of age, her parents reported that she could perform activities that were developmentally appropriate for her age, including walking, holding on, and using a cup; physical examination was normal. Routine childhood immunizations were administered. During the next 2 months, the patient had two episodes of recurrent vomiting; the episodes lasted 3 days and 5 days and were associated with lethargy and decreased oral intake, as well as with diarrhea on some but not all occasions. During each episode, an examination performed in the emergency department of the other hospital was normal, and no fever or abdominal pain was present. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis with dehydration was made during each episode. Ondansetron and intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient returned home. The episodes resolved spontaneously. Three weeks before the current admission, milk formula was stopped and a soy-based formula was begun. Laboratory Data Obtained at the Other Hospital. Eighteen days before the current admission to the other hospital, the patient was seen by a pediatric gastroenterologist at this hospital. Examination was normal, and a possible diagnosis of vomiting caused by nonketotic hypoglycemia was made. Her parents were advised to seek a medical evaluation for her, including metabolic studies, if another episode occurred. On the day of admission, four episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting occurred in the evening, and the patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. The patient had been born at full-term gestation, without complications during gestation or delivery. The weight at birth was 3.3 kg, and the length 50.2 cm. The Apgar scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes were 8 and 9, respectively. Jaundice was noted during the newborn period. The patient was breast-fed exclusively for 8 weeks and received supplemental formula thereafter, and solid foods were introduced at 5 months. She had mild facial eczema. She received no medications and had no known allergies. Her father had gallstones and had had pancreatitis in his 20s, her paternal grandmother had gallstones, her paternal grandfather had colon cancer, both grandfathers had diabetes mellitus, her maternal grandfather had arthritis, and a distant paternal cousin had Crohn\u2019s disease; there was no family history of celiac disease. On examination in the emergency department, the patient vomited and had dry heaves intermittently. There was a regular heart rate and rhythm, and the temperature, respiratory rate, and remainder of the general examination were normal. Blood levels of amylase, lipase, ammonia, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, pyruvate kinase, and amino acids were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and leukocyte esterase by dipstick and 5 white cells per high-power field; screening for toxins in the urine was negative, and a urine culture was sterile. A presumptive diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, and the patient was admitted to the pediatric inpatient unit for observation and rehydration. On admission to the pediatric inpatient unit, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They reported that in retrospect, during the previous 3 months, the patient had stopped pulling to stand or attempting to walk and was only crawling (and when doing so appeared to be unsteady, with occasional \u201cface plants\u201d). They noted occasional \u201cshakes\u201d when she woke up in the morning, which consisted of symmetric movement for a few seconds that would recur over a 10-minute period, without loss of tone or consciousness. On examination, the patient was alert and interactive. Frontal bossing was present and the fontanelle was full, with mild pulsations that were visible anteriorly when she was in the supine position. The weight was 9.9 kg, the length 78.3 cm, and the head circumference 51.5 cm (>95th percentile). The eye movements were normal, the pupils were equally reactive, and there was no horizontal or vertical limitation or nystagmus. The legs had decreased muscle tone, with brisk 3+ patellar reflexes, and the plantar reflexes were flexor. There was no crossed adductor reflex (i.e., no contraction of both hip adductors when the knee jerk was elicited on either side, which is a sign of pyramidal tract dysfunction in patients older than 8 months of age) and no ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal, including evaluation of the muscle tone in the shoulder girdle. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, white-cell count, and white-cell differential count were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient\u2019s pediatrician was contacted for additional information about her growth (Figure 1). Growth Charts.Panel A shows the patient\u2019s charts for length and weight in relation to age. Since birth, the weight has remained near the 50th percentile for her age and the length has ranged between the 50th percentile and above the 95th percentile, with the most recent measurement, obtained when she was 14 months of age, falling in the 75th percentile. Panel B shows the patient\u2019s chart for head circumference in relation to age and for weight in relation to length. The head circumference was in the 50th percentile at birth but was above the 95th percentile when she was 9 months of age, with continued increase in percentile between 9 and 14 months of age.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before this presentation, when intermittent fevers to a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C occurred, followed by episodes of cramping in the periumbilical and subumbilical abdominal regions, without vomiting. He had one or two bowel movements daily; the stools were formed, and hematochezia had occurred on one or two occasions. He had reportedly been unable to attend school for 2.5 weeks. Two days before this presentation, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, albumin, amylase, lipase, and urea nitrogen were normal, as were urinalysis and results of liver-function tests. Screening tests for celiac disease and Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed circumferential, moderate thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (with the largest lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in diameter), with no surrounding fat stranding. No dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest bowel obstruction or any other areas of bowel-wall thickening. The appendix was normal, and there was no abscess formation. Abdominal Imaging Studies.Contrast-enhanced axial and coronal CT scans (Panels A and B, respectively) show circumferential, moderate thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure (arrows) and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads). An ultrasound image (Panel C) shows circumferential, marked thickening of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure (arrows) and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy (arrowheads). The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. He reportedly had had intermittent, mild, self-resolving abdominal pain throughout childhood that was associated with diarrhea and was thought to be caused by lactose intolerance. He reported having a stable weight while he was consuming a regular diet (which included dairy) and occasional headaches but no joint pains or mouth sores. He had had frequent bouts of acute pharyngitis (\u201cstrep throat\u201d) during early childhood and had undergone a tonsillectomy at 19 months of age and sinus surgery in the past. His immunizations were current; he took no medications and had no known allergies. He was a student and lived with his parents. His father had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, his father\u2019s cousin had Crohn\u2019s disease, and a paternal uncle and great-grandfather had had colon cancer at 60 and 65 years of age, respectively. Both grandmothers had diabetes mellitus, and other relatives had heart disease. On examination, the patient appeared to be healthy and was in no distress. The blood pressure was 136/76 mm Hg, the pulse 84 beats per minute, the weight 48.6 kg, and the height 151.4 cm; his weight and height were both at the 96th percentile for his age. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with no organomegaly. An abdominal radiograph, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a normal bowel-gas pattern, and no dilated loops of bowel were present to suggest obstruction. Ultrasonography of the abdomen (Figure 1C) revealed circumferential, marked thickening of a long segment of the colonic wall at the hepatic flexure and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Color Doppler imaging studies showed increased blood flow in the affected segment of the colon. Additional follow-up was scheduled. During the next 10 days, the pain became more constant; the patient reported pain that waxed and waned between 5 and 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and occasional, brief pain-free intervals that lasted minutes. The pain varied in quality between cramping and sharp and was located below the umbilicus in both lower quadrants, with occasional radiation to the epigastrium and lower back. Eating increased the pain, and the patient lost approximately 3 kg of weight over several weeks. Hematochezia became more frequent. Intermittent fevers and associated night sweats occurred. There was no improvement with ibuprofen or acetaminophen; the combination of acetaminophen and codeine caused increased stomach distress, and a cold pack occasionally helped to decrease this discomfort. Eleven days after the patient presented to the gastroenterology clinic, his family called because of another episode of abdominal pain and associated low-grade fever. The family declined to have the patient seen urgently in the clinic. Diphenhydramine was prescribed, and the patient\u2019s family was advised to contact the clinician if symptoms worsened. Two weeks after the patient\u2019s initial presentation, he was seen at a scheduled follow-up appointment.

The patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myocardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibrillation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission. Seven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral artery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarction involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe. Although continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patient\u2019s strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixaban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was discharged home on the second hospital day. Four days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head (performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material) and MRI of the head (performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material) were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was discharged home on the fourth hospital day. Three weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and withdrawn affect. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally. CT of the chest (Figure 1A) revealed diffuse emphysematous changes, including a spiculated mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung. CT of the abdomen (Figure 1B) revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney. Initial Imaging Studies.Two weeks before the current admission, CT of the chest and abdomen was performed with the administration of contrast material. An axial image from CT of the chest (Panel A) shows a mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung (arrow). A coronal image from CT of the abdomen (Panel B) shows an exophytic hypodense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney (arrow). On the current admission, CT angiography and MRI of the head were performed. A maximum-intensity-projection image from CT angiography (Panel C) shows calcification of the carotid siphons but no radiologically significant stenosis. An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image from MRI (Panel D) shows confluent low attenuation of the periventricular white matter and corona radiata (arrow). An axial diffusion-weighted image from MRI (Panel E) shows multiple new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the left lentiform nucleus, and the right frontal white matter (arrows). On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home. Three days after discharge from the rehabilitation center, and 1 week before the current admission, numbness and tingling in the right hand and forearm developed, and the patient\u2019s daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treatment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxaparin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day. Five days after discharge, the patient\u2019s daughter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and difficulty with balance had worsened since discharge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications included enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metformin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some difficulty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Pronator drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and rheumatoid factor were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The hemoglobin level was 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5); the remainder of the complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Thed-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained. CT angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1C), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right cerebral peduncle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in multifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intracranial arteries. MRI of the head (Figure 1D and 1E), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilaterally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left subinsular region, the medial right precentral gyrus, the anterior right frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyri, and the right temporal lobe. There were also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and T2-weighted imaging, findings that are indicative of moderate small-vessel disease. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous heparin was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth.

He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctranscendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and electroconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on a monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine. Approximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incontinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed. Five years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to perform serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later. Additional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of valproic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction. During the next 12 months, the dose of valproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symptoms of confusion, some difficulty with memory, and decreased leg coordination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment). Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Figure 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence. Initial MRI of the Head.An axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) and a T2-weighted image (Panel B) show an old lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata (arrowhead), mild scattered hyperintensities suggestive of small-vessel ischemic changes (arrows), and mild generalized brain parenchymal volume loss. Neuropsychiatric testing was performed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progressively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months. Three months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambulation, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was replaced by fluoxetine. One month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatry unit of this hospital because of worsening depression, which he attributed to the progressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Examination was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. During the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms. The patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and multiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal hernia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasidone, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused muscle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropriate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expression. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with bradykinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmagnetic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps.

The patient had been well until approximately 2 weeks before presentation, when fatigue and malaise gradually developed. One week before presentation, she was seen in the outpatient clinic at this hospital for routine HIV follow-up. She reported having had unprotected intercourse with a new HIV-positive male partner 1 month earlier and was concerned about sexually transmitted diseases. Physical examination was normal. A complete blood count, measurement of electrolyte levels including calcium, and results of renal-function tests were normal; nucleic acid testing of a urine specimen was negative forChlamydia trachomatisandNeisseria gonorrhoeae; other laboratory results are shown inTable 1. Immunizations for hepatitis A and B, influenza, pneumococcus, and combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis were administered. Laboratory Data. During the next week, an erythematous, nonpruritic, nonpainful rash developed over the patient's chest and abdomen and then resolved spontaneously within hours. She reported episodes of epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, more severe at night, that awakened her from sleep; she had occasional brief, sharp abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. Nausea occurred intermittently after eating, without alteration in the pain. Approximately 2 days before admission, episodes of right-sided chest pain developed, which increased with hiccups and deep inspiration and lasted up to 12 minutes. On the morning of admission, she awoke with right-sided chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The pain was associated with transient diaphoresis, nausea, and shortness of breath. She came to this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg during the previous 2 months and mild constipation during the previous 2 weeks. Eight years before admission, a diagnosis of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection was made during an evaluation of wasting, thrush, hair loss, and malaise; she has been receiving treatment with antiretroviral medications since then. Four months before admission, she transferred her care to this hospital, and baseline test results were obtained (Table 1). She also had dyslipidemia, obesity, anxiety, depression, recurrent sinusitis, alcohol and opiate dependence, candidal vaginitis, chronic neuropathy in a glove-and-stocking distribution, gastroesophageal reflux disease, a history of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and chlamydia infections, and a remote history of surgical procedures for a femur fracture and endometriosis. Medications included methadone, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, a tenofovir\u2013emtricitabine combination, valacyclovir, trazodone, quetiapine, and bupropion. She was allergic to sulfa drugs and levofloxacin. She was a student and lived in a drug-free group home. She smoked cigarettes. She reported no ingestion of raw food, exposure to sick contacts or animals, or recent travel. On examination, the patient was obese; the vital signs and examination were otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of 61 beats per minute, with anterior ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities similar to those seen on a previous tracing. A complete blood count and a white-cell differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, iron, iron-binding capacity, creatine kinase isoenzymes, troponin I, and troponin T; testing for antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Toxicologic screening of the blood and the urine was negative. Results of ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a dilated common bile duct but were otherwise normal, without evidence of intrahepatic biliary-duct dilatation or sonographic Murphy's sign (localized tenderness over the gallbladder). Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin testing was negative.

A diagnosis of a viral illness was made, and follow-up with his pediatrician was recommended. When the patient was reexamined by the nurse 4 days later, the temperature was normal. The skin was pale, the pharynx was slightly erythematous, and the abdomen was tender. At follow-up visits with the school nurse 10 and 6 days before admission, the patient reported persistent upper abdominal pain; the temperature was 38.6\u00b0C at both visits. On the day of admission, the patient reported headache, nausea, and pain in the right upper abdomen and left leg. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, and the skin appeared to be more pale. He was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital, where he reported nausea, occasional diarrhea, and abdominal pain. On examination, he appeared mildly ill. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 92/58 mm Hg, the pulse 123 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air.

The skin was pale, warm, and dry. The abdomen was soft and nontender, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Normal saline, acetaminophen, and oxygen (through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute) were administered; the tachycardia resolved. The patient was transferred by ambulance to this hospital. Laboratory Data. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported a mild cough, myalgias, fatigue that had been worsening for 1 month, and occasional dizziness during the previous 2 weeks. He also reported nearly constant periumbilical pain that occasionally radiated to the left lower quadrant; he described the pain as \u201csqueezing\u201d and rated it at up to 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He had daily loose stools that were green, with occasional blood mixed in and on the toilet paper, but he had no increased bruising or bleeding when he brushed his teeth. He had been previously healthy and his immunizations were reportedly current, with the exception of a seasonal influenza vaccine. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been born in the Caribbean, had come to the United States 4 years earlier, was a student, and lived with his parents and two siblings. He had visited the Dominican Republic, including a rural village, 3 months before admission; he had not taken malaria prophylaxis. He had pet fish and no exposures to animals or sick contacts. There was no family history of sickle cell disease, other hereditary anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, or autoimmune diseases. On examination, the patient was thin and appeared younger than his age. The vital signs and oxygen saturation (while he was breathing ambient air) were normal. The conjunctiva and oral mucosa were pale. There was no palpable peripheral lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was distended, with mild tenderness on palpation in the right upper and left lower quadrants; there were ecchymoses on the shins, and the remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen showed no occult blood. Blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests. Other test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the abdomen (Figure 1) showed a moderate amount of fecal matter in the colon and no dilated bowel loops, free air, or skeletal abnormality. Abdominal Radiograph.A radiograph of the abdomen shows a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon and no evidence of obstruction. Urinalysis revealed 1+ urobilinogen. Blood and stool specimens were sent for culture. Screening of blood specimens for malaria\u2013specific antigens was negative and for cold agglutinins was nonreactive at a dilution of 1:16.

The patient had been well until 10 days before admission, when fever and cough that was productive of clear sputum developed. She also had fatigue, eye redness, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and myalgias. Seven days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. On examination, there was conjunctival injection in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Treatment with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan was recommended. During the next 2 days, the fever decreased but did not resolve with the use of acetaminophen. New mild chest discomfort occurred with coughing. An expectorated sputum specimen contained flecks of blood, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. The physical examination was unchanged, and rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. Additional treatment with ibuprofen, benzonatate, and guaifenesin was recommended. Three days before this admission, the patient had persistent symptoms and was unable to sleep because of the fever and cough. New shortness of breath developed. She was evaluated by a primary care physician at the other hospital in a telehealth visit. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin was started, and close monitoring was recommended. During the next 3 days, the shortness of breath increased in severity, and the patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported cough that was worse with exertion and deep breathing, improved with rest, and was associated with pain in the chest and back on the left side. The sputum had streaks of bright red blood. Other symptoms included fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgias, and pain in both knees when walking. The eye redness had resolved, but there was mild soreness of the right eye. There was no headache, ear pain, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. The patient had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip and was otherwise healthy. She had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included amoxicillin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, benzonatate, guaifenesin, and dextromethorphan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, father, and brother. She performed well in high school, which she was attending remotely because of the Covid-19 pandemic; she had no known sick contacts. She had traveled to a Caribbean island 1 year earlier. She was a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and brother were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.9. The patient appeared pale, and she coughed and sniffled frequently. She did not use accessory muscles while breathing, and breath sounds in the lower lung fields were decreased. There was no conjunctival injection, lymphadenopathy, joint swelling or tenderness, or rash; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The creatinine level was 2.00 mg per deciliter (177 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the C-reactive protein level 77.5 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The hemoglobin level was 6.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the hematocrit 21.1% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the white-cell count 11,890 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), and the platelet count 526,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed more than 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), as well as mixed granular casts and red-cell casts. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2, influenza types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative.

Chest Imaging Studies.Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest (Panels A and B, respectively) show patchy airspace opacities, predominantly in the lower lung zones (see boxes). On the lateral radiograph, the opacities are most prominent in the mid-to-posterior aspect of the lungs. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Axial reformatted CT images of the chest (Panels C and D), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula (left lung), and the middle lobe (right lung).

One month before admission, the patient traveled abroad. She spent a week in Sweden visiting family members, including her young grandchildren, and then she traveled to India 25 days before admission. She was well until 14 days before admission, when malaise and a nonpainful, nonpruritic, erythematous, maculopapular rash developed. The rash first appeared on the thighs; by the following day, it had become diffuse, involving the legs and feet (including the soles), arms and hands (including the palms), abdomen, chest, and flanks. On the fifth day of illness, the patient was seen by a physician in India. A complete blood count was reportedly normal. An unspecified medication was administered intramuscularly, and fexofenadine, ranitidine, a 9-day tapering course of prednisone, and a 5-day course of erythromycin were prescribed. During the next 10 days, malaise persisted, the rash did not improve, and a mild, dry cough developed. The patient also noted mild blurred vision, which was worse in the left eye than in the right eye and was accompanied by mild photophobia and floaters with a spiderweb appearance. One or two episodes of diarrhea occurred each day, and she took loperamide. Two days before admission, the patient returned to Sweden to visit family members. While she was there, arthralgias of the knees developed and the left eye became red. The patient then took a flight back to the United States, which landed on the day of admission; when she arrived, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported fatigue, decreased appetite, diffuse myalgias, and mild, generalized swelling that was most prominent around the ankles. She had not noted fever or headache. She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, depression, cataracts, and osteopenia, and she had undergone tonsillectomy during childhood, myomectomy and ovarian cystectomy 32 years before this admission, and allograft reconstruction of an injured right anterior cruciate ligament 11 years before this admission. The patient was taking lisinopril and had no known allergies to medications; amitriptyline had caused paresthesias, and she had had anxiety while she was taking oxycodone and acetaminophen in combination. Immunizations were reportedly current; in preparation for her trip to India, she had received an unspecified hepatitis vaccine. The patient was married, lived with her husband in a suburban area of New England, and was retired. She had traveled extensively, including trips to northern and eastern Europe, Africa, and Central America. During her recent trip, she visited a national park in central India, where she received multiple mosquito bites. She observed a variety of wild animals but did not have contact with them. While she was in the park, approximately 23 days before admission, she found an engorged tick on her right leg. She reported that she does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs and had stopped smoking tobacco 34 years earlier, with a history of 14 pack-years. There was a family history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. On examination, the patient had a labile affect; she appeared to be confused intermittently and made nonsensical statements occasionally. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 163/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. Mild photophobia was present, and there were flat patches of subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and petechiae on the hard palate. She coughed with deep breathing, but the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was trace edema of the feet but no erythema, swelling, pain with movement, or warmth of the knees. There was a diffuse erythematous rash, which was macular and nonblanching on the lower legs and on the palms and soles (Figure 1) and was maculopapular and blanching, without coalescence, on the thighs, abdomen, chest, and arms. The remainder of the general examination was normal. Clinical Photographs.A macular, nonblanching rash is visible on the lower leg, palm, and sole (Panels A, B, and C, respectively). The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, red-cell indexes, platelet count, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis showed clear, yellow urine, with 2+ ketones, 2+ leukocyte esterase, a specific gravity of 1.015, and a pH of 5.0; on microscopic examination, there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 20 to 50 white cells per high-power field, and 1+ bacteria. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm, with sinus arrhythmia, poor R-wave progression, and minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.

The patient had been in her usual health until 1 month before this admission, when pain in the right shoulder and discomfort in the left lower abdomen developed. The shoulder pain worsened with inspiration and was associated with nonproductive cough, intermittent fevers (to a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C), sinus pain, nasal discharge, periorbital erythema, and difficulty breathing. Eleven days before this admission, she presented to another health center for evaluation. Physical examination reportedly revealed a new cardiac murmur. A chest radiograph showed a mass in the right middle lobe and a right pleural effusion. Six days before this admission, an axial computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest that was obtained at another hospital showed a homogeneous opacity (5.8 cm by 4.9 cm) extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular septal thickening in the right middle lobe, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, and a loculated right pleural effusion. The patient was admitted to that hospital, and thoracentesis was performed. Results of analysis of the serosanguineous pleural fluid (120-ml sample) are shown inTable 1. Culture of the fluid grewStaphylococcus lugdunensis. The patient was discharged home the next morning, with a prescription for a 5-day course of azithromycin and cefpodoxime. She was referred to the thoracic surgery service at this hospital for further evaluation and bronchoscopy. Pleural-Fluid Analysis. On presentation 5 days later, bronchoscopic evaluation revealed erythema in the right bronchus intermedius and bronchus of the right middle lobe, with no endobronchial lesions or secretions. Microbiologic testing and cytologic examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid from the right middle lobe were nondiagnostic. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The patient reported headaches and pain along the diaphragm and right shoulder on deep inspiration. At 17 years of age, she had had hydrocephalus due to a web in the aqueduct of Sylvius that resolved after temporary placement of a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt and performance of an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Temporal-lobe epilepsy later developed and was caused by a right mesial temporal cavernous malformation that was successfully resected. A second cavernous malformation in the cerebellum had been stable on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was born in Europe and had moved to the United States 8 years earlier. She had visited Switzerland, California, and Michigan during the previous year, and she had visited Cuba 10 years earlier. She was married and worked in a research field, with exposures to yeast and mice 2 years earlier. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma. On examination, the temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the other vital signs were normal. Decreased breath sounds in the right lung and a soft cardiac murmur were present. The examination was otherwise normal. An axial CT scan of the chest, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed a homogeneous opacity (5.8 cm by 4.9 cm) extending from the pleura to the hilum, as well as interlobular septal thickening in the right middle lobe, a nodule (3 mm in diameter) in the right upper lobe, atelectasis in both lower lobes, and a loculated right pleural effusion that was bigger than that seen on the scan obtained 6 days earlier (Figure 1). CT Scans Obtained on the First Admission.Axial CT scans of the chest, obtained at the lung window setting (Panel A) and the soft-tissue window setting (Panel B), show a homogeneous mass in the right middle lobe that causes occlusion of the bronchi (Panel A, arrow). A small right pleural effusion and relaxation atelectasis in the right lower lobe are also visible. Blood levels of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 2. Vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered for 1 day after the bronchoscopy. Peripheral-Blood Laboratory Data. The next day, a chest tube was inserted into the right pleural space, and 1600 ml of yellow pleural fluid was drained; results of pleural-fluid analysis are shown inTable 1. Cytologic examination of the fluid revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils but no malignant cells. On the fourth day, the chest tube was removed. The patient was discharged home the following day, with a prescription for a 3-week course of ceftriaxone. During the next month, follow-up imaging studies of the chest showed increasing nodular thickening of the right major fissure, a left pleural effusion, and a decreasing right pleural effusion; the findings were otherwise stable. Pathological examination of specimens obtained from a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core biopsy of the large mass in the right middle lobe showed mixed inflammation, with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. Microbiologic staining and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were negative. One month after admission to this hospital, symptoms persisted and the patient was readmitted for further evaluation. She reported a dry cough, dyspnea, generalized fatigue, weakness, and pain in her shoulders, neck, and lower back. Medications included narcotic analgesic agents, ranitidine, calcium carbonate, and acetaminophen. On examination, the vital signs were normal, and the oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The breath sounds were decreased bilaterally; the decrease was greater on the left side than on the right. Pulmonary-function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.18 liters (37% of the predicted value), a forced vital capacity of 1.40 liters (36% of the predicted value), a peak expiratory flow rate of 4.25 liters per minute (65% of the predicted value), and a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity corrected for alveolar volume of 3.47 ml per minute per millimeter of mercury per liter (62% of the predicted value). Results of coagulation tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were normal; other test results are shown inTable 2. Urinalysis was normal. Chest radiographs showed a mass in the right middle lobe, a patchy left basilar opacity that was consistent with atelectasis, a stable right pleural effusion, and a moderate left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was inserted into the left pleural space. Cytologic examination of serosanguineous pleural fluid (75-ml sample) revealed mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils; other test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, thoracoscopy, lobectomies of the right middle and lower lobes, total pulmonary decortication, and dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes were all performed with the use of video-assisted techniques. Pathological examination revealed evidence of extensive lipoid pneumonia (i.e., the accumulation of lipids in the alveoli) and fibrinous pleuritis. The patient had no complications associated with the procedures and was discharged home 5 days later. During the next 5 months, the patient had persistent dyspnea on exertion and pain in the inferior portion of the chest that was thought to be musculoskeletal. Chest radiographs showed postoperative changes and pleural effusions, without infiltrates. Six months after the first admission to this hospital, examination revealed crackles, for which an antibiotic agent was administered; the symptoms improved. Three weeks later, cardiopulmonary testing with the use of a modified Bruce protocol, performed at rest and after 12 minutes of exercise, revealed pulses of 96 and 151 beats per minute and oxygen saturations of 99% and 88% (while the patient was breathing ambient air), respectively. Two weeks later, at an outpatient visit, the patient reported night sweats, persistent cough, fatigue, and sinus congestion. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 2. A chest CT that was obtained during that visit showed new bilateral, subpleural ground-glass and reticular opacities. Subpleural nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe and consolidation in the medial right lung around the bronchial stump were present (Figure 2). CT Scans Obtained 7 Months after the First Admission.Coronal (Panel A) and axial (Panels B and C) CT scans of the chest show subpleural ground-glass opacities and reticulation (Panels A and B, arrowheads), as well as consolidation in the medial right lung around the bronchial stump and in the left lower lobe (Panels A and C, arrows). Bronchoscopy was performed, and cytologic examination and microbiologic testing of the BAL fluid were nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry revealed 34% granulocytes, a finding consistent with inflammation. Chest pain, which the patient rated at 5 out of 10 at rest and 8 out of 10 with deep inspiration and coughing (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain), persisted despite administration of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, glucocorticoid therapy, and a narcotic analgesic agent. One week later, pain in the right hip developed, without a known injury. The following week, examination revealed pain on active flexion of the right hip. Test results are shown inTable 2. MRI of the hip, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a right superior labral tear with a surrounding inflammatory change (2.0 cm by 1.7 cm) along the proximal right iliopsoas muscle and a left adnexal cyst (4.0 cm by 2.5 cm); there was no evidence of fracture or osteonecrosis. MRI of the pelvis was performed; T2-weighted images showed an abnormal signal that extended along the right iliac vessels and involved the adjacent medial right psoas and iliacus muscles, with no fluid collection. A hemorrhagic left ovarian cyst and a right paracentral disk protrusion at L4\u2013L5 that had contact with the descending right L4 nerve roots were also noted.", "true_dx": "IgG4-related pulmonary disease.", "pred_dx": "Sarcoidosis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Okay, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 36-year-old woman who suddenly starts having shoulder pain and some abdominal discomfort.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's interesting.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Then, she develops a fever, has trouble breathing, and even gets a heart murmur.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, these symptoms seem like they're pointing towards something systemic, maybe an infection or an inflammatory process?", "t": 4, "c": "3", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She went to see another doctor and they found a mass in her lung and some fluid around it.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They took some of that fluid and cultured it, and it grew Staphylococcus lugdunensis.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's a type of bacteria, so we might be dealing with a bacterial infection.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But wait, they treated her with antibiotics and then sent her home.", "t": 4, "c": "10", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That seems a bit odd if it's still causing problems.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "When she comes back, she's still having issues.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "There's more fluid in her lungs, and now there's a mass in her lung that's causing some blockage.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They do a bronchoscopy and don't find any obvious infections or cancer.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, what else could it be?

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 6 weeks before the current presentation, when lower abdominal pain developed along the midline. The pain was sharp and crampy, increased with movement, and decreased with lying down. During the next 24 hours, the pain shifted from the midline to the right side. The patient was taken to the emergency department of a hospital affiliated with this hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/82 mm Hg, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The lower abdomen had mild tenderness that was present on both sides but was greater on the right side. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or tenderness at the costovertebral angle. The white-cell count was 14,270 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,500) and the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The urinalysis was normal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were performed.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a complex, thick-walled cyst in the right ovary. There were multiple follicular cysts, measuring up to 1.7 cm in diameter, in the left ovary. Doppler flow was normal in both ovaries. There was a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. The appendix was not visualized. Acetaminophen, ketorolac, and intravenous fluids were administered. A diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst was considered, and the patient was discharged home with plans to undergo repeat transabdominal ultrasonography 6 weeks later. After the patient was discharged from the emergency department, the abdominal pain slowly resolved. Three days after discharge, the patient resumed competitive long-distance running. Five weeks later, and 4 days before the current presentation, she participated in a running competition. The next day, abdominal pain recurred, and the patient was unable to go to school. She took ibuprofen, but it did not alleviate the pain. She was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. The patient reported that the current episode of abdominal pain was similar to the episode that had occurred 6 weeks earlier. She had no fever, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dysuria, hematuria, frequent urination, or vaginal bleeding or discharge. She had noticed an increase in her waist size during the past 2 weeks and had difficulty fitting into her pants. The patient had no notable medical history. She took no medications and had no known allergies. She had normal growth and development; menarche had not occurred. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. The patient lived in suburban New England with her parents and sister. She was not sexually active and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and sister were healthy; menarche had occurred in her mother and sister when they were each 12 years of age. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/89 mm Hg, and the pulse 95 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.7. The right lower abdomen was firm and distended, with mild tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there was no rebound, guarding, or evidence of a discrete mass or hepatosplenomegaly on palpation. Development of pubic hair and breasts was classified as Tanner stage 4 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development). The white-cell count was 16,120 per microliter and the hemoglobin level 10.1 g per deciliter. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were performed. Transabdominal ultrasonography with Doppler analysis revealed a heterogeneous mass, measuring 16.6 cm by 15.6 cm by 9.9 cm, that was inseparable from the right ovary with the use of probe pressure maneuvers. The mass had normal vascular flow and areas of increased echogenicity. The left ovary was normal, and there was a moderate-to-large amount of free fluid in the pelvis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a heterogeneously attenuating mass, measuring 17.8 cm by 13.6 cm by 8.6 cm, that displaced the bowel and pelvic viscera. The mass had prominent amorphous, peripherally enhancing components and internal vasculature. The right ovary was not definitively identified separately. There was a large amount of ascitic fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, also showed a heterogeneous mass with thick, nodular, peripheral enhancement that appeared to originate from the right adnexa. The endometrial lining appeared thickened, measuring up to 22 mm in thickness. Imaging Studies.MRI of the pelvis was performed. A coronal T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows a large, heterogeneous, round lesion (arrows). The lesion has internal solid, mixed hypointense and hyperintense signal intensity and multiple internal cystic foci. A sagittal T2-weighted image (Panel B) shows endometrial hypertrophy (22 mm in thickness). The lesion is only partially visible anterosuperior to the uterus and the large-volume ascites (Panels A and B, asterisks). CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reconstruction images (Panels C and D, respectively) show the full extent of the large heterogeneous lesion (arrows). The lesion has areas of nodular, solid enhancement. Large-volume ascites in the abdomen and pelvis is also noted (Panels C and D, asterisks), along with endometrial hypertrophy (Panel D, arrowhead).

The patient had been well until 4 days before this admission, when fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, retro-orbital headache, and photophobia developed. On presentation to a clinic affiliated with the university where she was a student, she reported that, 6 days earlier, she had returned from a trip to Indonesia. A blood-smear examination for malaria was negative, and the patient was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Over the next 2 days, her symptoms worsened, and abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant and arthralgias affecting the knees developed. On the third day of illness, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination at the other hospital, the temperature was 41.0\u00b0C. The blood lactic acid level and results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Tests for heterophile antibodies, influenza, andClostridium difficilewere negative. Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture, and a lumbar puncture was performed; on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, the white-cell and red-cell counts and protein and glucose levels were normal. Laboratory Data. Chest radiography revealed no evidence of focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or hilar adenopathy. Abdominal radiography revealed multiple air-filled loops of small bowel but no evidence of abnormal bowel dilatation, obstruction, or free air. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of a few subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. There was no bowel-wall thickening, obstruction, ascites, or hepatosplenomegaly. The kidneys were heterogeneous in appearance. Acetaminophen was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. High temperatures persisted; cooling blankets were applied, and more than 7 liters of fluid were administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, intravenous doxycycline and ceftriaxone were administered. Three blood-smear examinations for malaria, a stool culture for enteric pathogens, and a stool examination for ova and parasites were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. By the third hospital day, cough and mild chest pain had developed, and hypoxemia was reportedly present; supplemental oxygen was administered, initially through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 4 liters per minute and then through a nonrebreather face mask at a flow rate of 15 liters per minute. Repeat chest radiography revealed diffuse, hazy opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, with new opacification of the left hemidiaphragm (Figure 1A). Chest Radiographs.A chest radiograph obtained on the third day at the other hospital (Panel A) shows new diffuse, hazy opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, with opacification of the left hemidiaphragm. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows rapidly progressing confluent perihilar opacities that are more prominent on the left side than on the right side, as well as a new small pleural effusion on the left side. Headache and photophobia persisted. A CT scan of the head was normal. Doxycycline was continued, ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered intravenously. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. In the ICU, the blood levels of lactic acid, amylase, lipase, and creatine kinase were normal, and tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. Furosemide was administered intravenously, and the patient had 3 liters of urine output. Therapy with oral oseltamivir and a continuous intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate was begun, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the medical ICU at this hospital. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported that fevers had occurred without periodicity and that photophobia, headache, and diffuse myalgias persisted. She had a history of anxiety and exercise-induced asthma and a remote history of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. Her only medication was citalopram, and she had no known allergies. She was a college student and lived with roommates in a rural area of New England. Twenty-seven days before the onset of illness, she had returned from a 10-day trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Six days before the onset of illness, she had returned from a 16-day ecology tour in rural Indonesia; she had traveled through the United Arab Emirates in transit to Indonesia, and the passenger seated next to her on the flight from the United Arab Emirates to Indonesia coughed intermittently during the trip. The patient did not receive any vaccinations before the trip and did not take malaria prophylaxis. While she was in Indonesia, she used mosquito netting during sleep but received multiple mosquito bites. She drank boiled water and pasteurized milk and ate rice and beans, thoroughly cooked meat, and fruit that had been washed but not peeled. She visited jungles and plantations and had contact with elephants, a bovine calf, and a juvenile macaque. She also observed but did not have contact with cats, dogs, bats, chickens, and cattle. She swam in jungle streams, ponds, and a waterfall pool. She reported that at the midpoint of the trip, a mild, nonpainful, nonpruritic rash developed; the rash first appeared on the wrists, spread centripetally and became diffuse, and then resolved. She was monogamous with her boyfriend, and they used condoms inconsistently. She did not smoke tobacco, but she smoked marijuana occasionally and drank alcohol rarely. On examination, the patient was irritable and appeared tired. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/57 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula (at a flow rate of 50 liters per minute, with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.5). She had a few petechiae on the palate, palpebral conjunctival injection, and mild neck stiffness. On auscultation of the chest, there were rales over both lung bases. There was mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness that was worst in the left lower quadrant, as well as a very faint blanching, macular rash on the thighs, arms, and lower abdomen (Figure 2). Application of a tourniquet to an arm for 5 minutes did not precipitate the development of petechiae. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The red-cell indexes, anion gap, and blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A rapid test for malaria antigen, a pregnancy test, and a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for influenza were negative. Urinalysis showed slightly cloudy yellow urine, with 1+ ketones, 1+ occult blood, a specific gravity of 1.012, and a pH of 5.0; on microscopic examination, amorphous crystals and mucin were present, and there were 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, no white cells per high-power field, and 0 to 2 hyaline casts per low-power field. Clinical Photograph.A photograph of the patient\u2019s arm, which was taken on examination at this hospital, shows a faint blanching, macular rash. (Photograph courtesy of Dr. Jeffrey A. Gelfand.) Chest radiography revealed rapidly progressing confluent perihilar opacities that were more prominent on the left side than on the right side, as well as a new small pleural effusion on the left side (Figure 1B). The left hemidiaphragm was completely obscured, possibly because of consolidation or atelectasis.

He also had myalgias, nausea, and vomiting but no fever, cough, or diarrhea. Ibuprofen and aspirin did not alleviate the symptoms. Two weeks later, headache and weakness persisted and new shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, and anorexia developed. Five days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at a local urgent care clinic. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. The next day, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, and the patient had a telemedicine visit through the urgent care clinic. He reported headache, nausea, anorexia, and weakness. Four days later, the headache worsened, and he had presyncope; he sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, multiple episodes of vomiting occurred. The patient described headache and pain localized behind the eyes, as well as persistent shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. There was no fever, cough, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient had undergone an appendectomy during childhood; he reported no other known medical conditions, was taking no medications, and had no known allergies to medications. The patient was born in Central America and was a university student there when he immigrated to the United States 3 months before admission. He worked in landscaping. He had had heterosexual contacts before immigration and reported that he had used condoms. He did not smoke tobacco or electronic cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of Massachusetts with nine other people, including his brother and sister and their families. The patient did not know his family medical history. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 62 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.3. The patient appeared fatigued, diaphoretic, and lethargic. He was intermittently agitated and increasingly somnolent, falling asleep multiple times during a conversation. He frequently squeezed his eyes closed and used his hands to hit his head, stating that it hurt. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; there was no nuchal rigidity. He was alert and oriented and followed commands. Cranial nerve examination was normal, but rotation of the head or lifting of the leg caused pain in the head, eyes, and neck. The lungs were clear. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of urinalysis and urine and blood toxicologic screening were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Chest radiography revealed no opacities. Acetaminophen and intravenous fluids were administered. Ninety minutes later, the patient was found on the ground next to the stretcher, on his hands and knees, incontinent of urine. Intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered empirically. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or large infarct. There was subtle hypodensity of the basal ganglia. There was posterior flattening of both globes and a partially empty sella turcica. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed posterior flattening of both globes and tapering of the transverse sinuses. T2-weighted images and T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed multiple small hyperintense foci in the caudate nuclei and putamina (Figure 1); several foci appeared to be cystic. In addition, there were scattered hyperintense foci in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the frontal lobes and the anterior corona radiata. MRI of the Head.A coronal, T2-weighted image shows abnormal hyperintense foci in the basal ganglia, including the caudate nuclei and putamina (arrows). Several of the more inferiorly located abnormalities have signal characteristics suggestive of small cysts. Lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was higher than 55 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and the glucose level 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]).

The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm necrotic mass in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radiation therapy for the lung nodules was also administered. Specimen of the Resected Mass.The gross specimen (Panel A) shows a well-encapsulated and focally necrotic mass (arrow). Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panels B and C) shows a high-grade spindle-cell sarcoma (Panel B, arrows) with a high level of mitotic activity (Panel C, arrow). Immunohistochemical stains for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 (Panels D and E, respectively) are diffusely positive in the tumor cells (arrows). However, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided. Eleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (temperature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; reference range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe. CT of the chest and abdomen (Figure 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, peritoneum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver. Imaging Studies.A coronal, contrast-enhanced CT image of the abdomen and pelvis obtained 1 month before the current admission (Panel A) shows metastases involving the right kidney (white arrowhead), retroperitoneal fat (white arrow), peritoneal space (black arrowhead), and musculature of the left leg (black arrow). A portable chest radiograph obtained on the current admission (Panel B) shows abundant pulmonary metastases. Coronal, maximum-intensity-projection CT images of the chest obtained 1 month before the current admission (Panel C) and on the current admission (Panel D) show an increase in the size and quantity of pulmonary metastases over the 1-month period. Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumonia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic. Eleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infusion. He reported weakness and appeared confused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glucose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s recent hospitalization showed multiple levels ranging from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter). The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hypoglycemia. Laboratory test results from the second hospital admission are shown inTable 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Three days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgrastim and a 3-day tapering course of dexamethasone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admitted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter). On the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermittent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hypertension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depression. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapentin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insulin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions. The patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included melanoma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy. The tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdominal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 days before admission, when episodes of twitching of the head and neck occurred. The first episode occurred after he awoke in the morning, and the second occurred 2 hours later; each of these episodes lasted approximately 1 minute. A third episode occurred 4 hours after he awoke, lasted 2 minutes, and was accompanied by stiffness of the left arm and left leg; the patient was aware of the twitching and stiffness but did not recall the subsequent events. Observers report that the patient\u2019s full body shook and that he lost consciousness and fell, striking his face. He stopped shaking after a few minutes and regained consciousness, but he was confused and was taken by emergency medical services to another hospital for evaluation. At the other hospital, another self-limited episode with full-body shaking and loss of consciousness reportedly occurred, and levetiracetam was administered. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, face, and cervical spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed minimally displaced fractures of the nasal bones bilaterally (Figure 1A) but no acute intracranial process or fractures of the cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed restricted diffusion in the cortex of the right superior frontal gyrus (Figure 1B and 1C). T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed marked hyperintensity in the cortex and white matter of the adjacent right frontal lobe (Figure 1D), a finding consistent with vasogenic edema. Two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance venography of the head revealed evidence of thrombosis or slow flow in the anterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus (Figure 1E). Susceptibility-weighted images of the head showed prominent linear hypointensity and evidence of cortical-vein thrombosis (Figure 1F). Imaging Studies of the Head.CT and MRI were performed at the other hospital. An axial CT image (Panel A) shows minimally displaced fractures of the nasal bones bilaterally. An axial diffusion-weighted image (Panel B) and the corresponding apparent-diffusion-coefficient map (Panel C) show restricted diffusion in the right superior frontal gyrus. An axial T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel D) shows marked hyperintensity in the adjacent cortex and subcortical white matter, a finding consistent with vasogenic edema. A sagittal maximum-intensity-projection image from a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance venogram (Panel E) shows no flow-related signal in the anterior third of the superior sagittal sinus (arrows), a finding consistent with slow flow or thrombosis. An axial susceptibility-weighted image (Panel F) shows linear hypointensity and susceptibility artifact in a superficial cortical vein along the right frontal convexity (arrow), a finding consistent with cortical-vein thrombosis. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was administered. The patient was transferred to the neurology inpatient service of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, the patient reported no headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. He had no history of bleeding or clotting disorders. Three years before admission, he had been involved in a motor vehicle accident related to falling asleep while driving. A CT scan of the head obtained at that time was reportedly normal, and antiepileptic medications were not prescribed. The patient had a tall stature and long arms; 10 years before admission, he had undergone cardiac evaluation after a family member in the health care field suggested the possibility that he had Marfan\u2019s syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography performed at that time reportedly showed normal size and function of the right and left ventricles, no clinically significant valvular disease, and a normal aortic root and ascending aorta. The patient had a history of myopia and had used corrective lenses since he was 15 years of age. Three years before admission, during an ophthalmologic evaluation for laser-assisted refractive surgery, he had received a diagnosis of ectopia lentis with downward lens dislocation in both eyes. The ophthalmologist recommended repeat cardiac evaluation for Marfan\u2019s syndrome, and a transthoracic echocardiogram obtained at that time was again normal. Four years before admission, the patient had undergone cholecystectomy. He had a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder; his mother reported that he had had delays in reaching developmental milestones as a child and had followed an individualized educational plan for a learning disorder. He took no medications. His mother had hypercholesterolemia, his maternal grandmother had dementia and seizures, and his paternal grandfather had died after a stroke when he was 70 years of age. There was no family history of clotting disorders, congenital heart disease, or sudden cardiac death. The patient was a college student, and he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/80 mg Hg, the pulse 55 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 189 cm, the weight 76 kg, the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21, and the arm span 192.5 cm. The distance from the top of the pubic symphysis to the floor was 105 cm while he was in the standing position. The patient was fully alert and oriented. He had complete fluency, with no paraphasic errors or dysarthria. His concentration and attention were intact. His memory was limited, with intact registration but poor recall. The visual fields were full in response to confrontation. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. There was no ptosis, and extraocular movements were intact, with no nystagmus or saccadic pursuit. On the face, sensations to light touch and temperature were normal. There was no facial asymmetry. The tongue and palate were midline, and the hearing was normal in response to a finger rub. The patient was able to shrug his shoulders and turn his head. His muscle bulk and tone were normal. He did not have cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, pronator drift, fasciculations, myoclonus, or tremor. Throughout the body, strength was full. Proprioception and sensations to light touch, temperature, pinprick, and vibration were intact. Deep-tendon reflexes were normal, and the toes were downgoing bilaterally. Results of finger\u2013nose\u2013finger and heel-to-shin tests were normal. Excoriations and ecchymoses were present on the nasal bridge and forehead. The patient had a high arched palate and slight pectus excavatum, and striae were present on his back. When he wrapped a hand around the contralateral wrist, the top of the thumb covered the entire fingernail of the fifth finger. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

The patient had a history of asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She had been well until the day before admission, when she noticed that her voice seemed hoarse and \u201cthick\u201d with increased salivation. That afternoon, nausea, retching, and worsening abdominal pain developed, with associated shortness of breath similar to that caused by her asthma. That evening, she was taken by ambulance to another hospital. On arrival in the emergency department, the patient reported sharp, constant, diffuse abdominal pain that she rated at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain), as well as throat tightness and dysphagia. On examination, she was alert, uncomfortable, and ill-appearing. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 138/79 mm Hg, the pulse 117 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with soft bowel sounds; there was pain on palpation in the left upper and both lower quadrants. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was reportedly normal. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and lipase and results of coagulation and liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 5.0, 1+ ketones, and trace leukocyte esterase and hemoglobin by dipstick, as well as bacteria, mucus, and 1 to 4 white cells and 1 to 3 red cells per high-power field. A chest radiograph showed linear opacities at the lung bases that were consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. Laboratory Data. A diagnosis of possible allergic reaction was made; diphenhydramine hydrochloride, ondansetron, morphine sulfate, famotidine, methylprednisolone, normal saline, and epinephrine were administered. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 106 beats per minute, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Radiographs of the soft tissue of the neck and the cervical spine showed multilevel degenerative disk and facet-joint disease. Oxygen supplementation was administered by means of a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation rose to 100%. An oral anticholinergic and antispasmodic solution (atropine sulfate, hyoscyamine, phenobarbital, scopolamine hydrobromide, and lidocaine) and an oral antacid solution (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) were administered. Within minutes, the patient was reportedly unable to drink the second half of the mixture. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, neck, spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed findings suggestive of small-bowel obstruction. A nasogastric tube was placed, and 250 ml of liquid removed. The patient reported horizontal diplopia, which had been developing during the previous 2 hours, and soon after had increasing difficulty speaking. She was transferred to this hospital by ambulance, arriving at 6:23 a.m., approximately 9 hours after presentation to the other hospital. On arrival, the patient, who was right-handed, communicated primarily by writing. She reported increasing shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation. The previous week, she had had an upper respiratory infection with a cough but no fever. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications at home were atorvastatin, dexlansoprazole, montelukast, and fluticasone\u2013salmeterol. She was allergic to sulfa drugs and levofloxacin. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She lived with her husband, worked in an office, and had not recently traveled. Her family history included hypertension, heart disease, and colon cancer; her husband was well. On the initial examination, performed at 6:40 a.m., the patient was alert and oriented. The blood pressure was 125/77 mm Hg, the pulse 122 beats per minute, the temperature 36.8\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, and nontender. On neurologic examination, the pupils were equal and reactive to light; the extraocular-muscle movement was intact, without nystagmus. There was binocular diplopia at far distances. The patient was unable to phonate clearly or protrude the tongue; other cranial-nerve functions, motor function, and peripheral sensation were intact. At 7 a.m., the patient was unable to elevate the palate, phonation was worse, and there was weakness on abduction of the right eye. The platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis, and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, lactic acid, total protein, albumin, globulin, amylase, lipase, IgA, C-reactive protein, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at rate of 123 beats per minute. Surgical and neurologic consultations were requested. On a repeat examination, performed by neurology consultants at 8:30 a.m., there was bilateral ptosis and weakness on eye abduction and elevation. Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, showed low-lying cerebellar tonsils with crowding of the foramen magnum, without evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, infarct, or mass lesion. Ipratropium was administered by nebulizer. During the next 2 hours, intermittent stridor and worsening weakness of the face, palate, and tongue developed, and the dyspnea worsened. Three hours after arrival, fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy revealed bilateral vocal-cord paralysis, with the cords fixed at 1 to 2 mm of opposition, without edema. Supplemental oxygen was administered, and the trachea was intubated for airway protection. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit. On examination, she was alert and able to follow commands promptly. There was bilateral complete ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and anisocoria; the left pupil was oval-shaped, with a vertical long axis of 8 mm, and was partially reactive in the upper half, and the right pupil was 6 mm in diameter and reactive to 4 mm. There was mild proximal weakness of the arms and legs (with a Medical Research Council grade of 4 on a scale of 0 [paralysis] to 5 [normal strength]); distal strength was preserved.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 weeks before admission, when vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, arthralgias, and episodes of epigastric pain of increasing frequency and severity developed, which she attributed to a viral gastroenteritis. Two weeks before admission, epigastric and midabdominal pain worsened, with diarrhea and one episode of vomiting. The next day, she came to the emergency department at this hospital. She rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and reported that it was worse when she was lying flat. The blood pressure was 150/82 mm Hg, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was soft, and there was mild epigastric tenderness without rebound; the remainder of the examination was normal. A stool specimen revealed occult blood. The red-cell indexes, platelet count, and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient returned home taking ranitidine, simethicone, and antacids. Three days later, upper endoscopic examination revealed a small hiatus hernia and was otherwise normal. Results ofHelicobacter pyloriantibody testing were reported as representing either infection or immunity; the blood level of haptoglobin was normal. Other test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, she was admitted to this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient reported no history of melena or hematochezia. She had labile hypertension (for which triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in combination and metoprolol had been prescribed at different times and discontinued because of hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively), hypercholesterolemia (with normal lipid profile 2 months earlier), allergic rhinitis, and possible gastroesophageal reflux disease, and she had had a urinary tract infection in the past. Imaging studies in the past had revealed ovarian cysts and bilateral pulmonary nodules, suggestive of old granulomatous disease. Medications included ranitidine, atorvastatin, and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. She had no history of allergies to medications. She was married, retired, and physically active. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. She had done no recent foreign traveling; her husband and friends had recently had transient gastroenteritis. The patient's father had died at 72 years of age from esophageal cancer, a grandfather and a paternal aunt had had lymphoma, and maternal cousins had sarcoma and lung cancer; her mother and children were healthy, and there was no family history of renal or rheumatologic diseases. On examination, the blood pressure was 160/77 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.7\u00b0C; the respirations and the remainder of the examination were normal. Blood levels of haptoglobin, glucose, folic acid, vitamin B12, ferritin, phosphorus, magnesium, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests; serum protein electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, and immunofixation showed no M component. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Review of the peripheral-blood smear revealed occasional reactive-appearing atypical lymphocytes. On the second day, a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were performed. Pathological examination of the specimen revealed trilineage hematopoiesis with normal morphologic features; a karyotype was normal. A small, clonal B-cell population (3% of B cells expressing CD19+ CD20+ CD5\u2212 CD10\u2212 kappa+) was detected with the use of flow cytometry; immunohistochemical staining revealed scattered T cells, occasional B cells, and occasional polyclonal plasma cells. Serologic testing for celiac disease was negative, as was examination of the stool forH. pyloriantigen, leukocytes, rotavirus, enteric pathogens, ova, and parasites. On the third day, the hematocrit fell to 24.5%. The ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, with negative antibody screening and a negative direct antiglobulin test, and 2 units of red cells (irradiated and leukocyte-reduced) were transfused; the hematocrit rose to 30.4%. The patient was discharged from the hospital. Two days after discharge, diarrhea developed, and 3 days later, anorexia, nausea, epigastric pain (constant, rated at 7 out of 10), and recurrent bilious and occasionally blood-streaked emesis occurred. The patient took bismuth subsalicylate, but her condition did not improve. The next day, she returned to the emergency department. She reported fevers (a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C), with chills and diaphoresis. On examination, the blood pressure was 179/92 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the temperature 37.0\u00b0C, with normal respirations and oxygen saturation. The abdomen was soft, with mild epigastric tenderness, without rebound or masses; the remainder of the examination was normal. The stool was black and positive for occult blood (trace). Test results are shown inTable 1. Ondansetron and intravenous fluids were administered. Within 3.5 hours, the systolic blood pressure rose to 200 mm Hg, and the pulse to 94 beats per minute. The temperature later rose to 38.1\u00b0C. Oxygen supplementation, ondansetron, antacids, oxycodone, acetaminophen, and irbesartan were administered. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed trace ascites and small pleural effusions. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Results of testing for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antibodies to double-stranded DNA were negative. The next day, renal vascular ultrasonography revealed no evidence of renal-artery stenosis. Methylprednisolone (1 g daily, intravenously) and labetalol were administered. Cytologic examination of the urine showed red-cell casts, hyaline casts, oxalate crystals, and no malignant cells. Culture of the urine grew few colonies (1000 to 10,000) of mixed bacteria.

Pertinent Clinical DetailsThis 61-year-old woman presented with a 4-week history of epigastric pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Arthralgias, fever, anemia, and acute kidney injury developed. The stool was guaiac-positive and positive forH. pyloriantigen, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal. In the past, she had had hyperlipidemia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. On examination, she had mild abdominal tenderness. Pertinent laboratory values include progressive anemia, an absence of leukocytosis, progressive renal failure, elevated blood levels of aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, serum immune electrophoresis with no monoclonal protein detected, and a high serum free light-chain ratio (kappa:lambda ratio, 3.1; normal range, 0.3 to 1.7). Urinalysis was pathognomonic for an acute glomerulonephritis, with proteinuria and red-cell casts. The rheumatoid factor was weakly positive. Testing for ANA was negative, and blood levels of complement were low (C4, very low; and C3, slightly decreased). Evaluation for anemia was consistent with anemia of chronic disease. A bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen showed 3% monoclonal B cells, which were CD5\u2212 CD10\u2212 kappa+. Rapidly Progressive GlomerulonephritisThis patient has abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis has developed, which is defined as a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate by more than 50% in a 3-month period.1The diagnosis must thus be associated with the causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (Table 2), which consist of the following three large groups of diseases: anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Goodpasture's syndrome),2pauci-immune or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis,3and the immune-complex\u2013mediated glomerulonephritides.Causes of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis.The first question that I ask when I see a patient with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is whether the pretest probability of the disease is so high and the pace of the disease so rapid that the benefit of empirical therapy outweighs the risk of harm. I agree with the use of high doses of methylprednisolone in cases such as this one (boluses of 500 to 1000 mg daily for 3 days). Anti\u2013Glomerular Basement Membrane DiseaseI would have considered and dismissed anti-GBM disease fairly quickly on the basis of the patient's abdominal symptoms on clinical presentation. I would have ordered testing for anti-GBM antibodies and expected a negative result. ANCA-Associated VasculitidesThe most common causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis are the ANCA-associated vasculitides. These include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome), and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.3ANCA-associated vasculitis typically involves the kidneys and upper and lower respiratory tracts but can involve other organs, including the skin, nerves, sinuses, central nervous system, and heart, and the gastrointestinal tract.4Isolated gastrointestinal involvement with vasculitis and ulcers is less common.5I would have requested ANCA testing, and if the results were positive, I would have avoided a renal biopsy. Immune-Complex\u2013Mediated GlomerulonephritisThe immune-complex glomerulonephritides are divided into normocomplementemic and hypocomplementemic glomerulonephritis (Table 2).Diseases that are associated with normal serum complement levels include IgA nephropathy and Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, which are both IgA-mediated, and fibrillary and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of glomerulonephritis and ranges from asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria to the nephrotic syndrome or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.6This patient could have classic Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura with abdominal pain and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, but the purpuric rash that characteristically appears on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs is absent; occasionally, the rash appears after the gastrointestinal and renal manifestations.7These two diseases are nonspecifically associated with elevated polyclonal IgA levels, which this patient did not have. A definitive diagnosis can be made by cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or renal biopsy to look for IgA deposition in small vessels.Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis are both immunoglobulin deposition diseases. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is polyclonal, and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis is often clonal, often with an associated monoclonal gammopathy.8Fibrillary glomerulonephritis occasionally causes low C3 levels.9Diseases with low complement levels include many diseases that activate the alternative complement pathway, which causes very low C3 and normal C4 levels, and very few diseases that activate the classic complement pathway, which causes a very low C4 level and a normal or mildly depressed C3 level.10The classic diseases associated with low complement levels are systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, shunt nephritis, bacterial endocarditis, visceral abscess, other infections, and C3 glomerulonephritis.11There are no features in this case to suggest a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, endocarditis, or other infections. This patient could have SLE with serositis and anemia. However, testing for ANA and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibody was negative.Membranoproliferative GlomerulonephritisMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a pathologic entity that can have a variety of causes (Figure 1).12,13The bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen in this case rules out myeloma, but the abnormal serum free light-chain ratio is suggestive of a monoclonal gammopathy.Causes of Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis.Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis can be related to monoclonal gammopathies, infections, collagen vascular diseases, or genetic disorders involving the complement pathway. In all these disorders except the genetic disorders, cryoglobulinemia (Cryo) can lead to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. HBV denotes hepatitis B virus, HCV hepatitis C virus, and HIV human immunodeficiency virus.CryoglobulinemiaThis patient has a very low C4 level and a slightly low C3 level, features consistent with activation of the classic complement pathway. The very low C4 level can be explained by cryoglobulinemia, SLE, congenital C4 deficiency, or C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency associated with hereditary angioedema. She had no history of angioedema, and it would be unusual for a patient at the age of this one to present with congenital C4 disease. SLE is very unlikely in a patient with a negative ANA test.Cryoglobulinemia is an immune-complex glomerulonephritis that activates the classic complement pathway. There are three types of cryoglobulinemia,14with different underlying causes. Type I cryoglobulinemia is characterized by an IgM or IgG M component that forms a cryoprecipitate by itself; the underlying disease is typically an immunoglobulin-secreting B-cell neoplasm such as Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) or plasma-cell myeloma. Type II cryoglobulinemia is characterized by an IgM or IgG M component that has rheumatoid-factor activity against polyclonal IgG. Type II cryoglobulinemia is also associated with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or myeloma, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and rheumatologic disorders. Type III cryoglobulinemia is characterized by a polyclonal IgM or IgG rheumatoid factor that binds polyclonal IgG; it tends to be associated with infections such as HCV, hepatitis B virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus and, less commonly, with endocarditis, SLE, and other rheumatologic diseases.15\u201319A number of lymphomas in addition to myeloma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma are associated with cryoglobulinemia.20\u201324In this patient, testing a warm specimen of blood for cryoglobulins should be considered.Could cryoglobulinemia explain this patient's clinical presentation?In addition to hypocomplementemia, patients with cryoglobulinemia frequently have renal disease, cutaneous involvement with necrotizing vasculitis, joint involvement, and neuropathy. In this patient, the low C4 level and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis would be consistent with cryoglobulinemia, but gastrointestinal involvement is uncommon.", "pred_dx": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's think about what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 61-year-old woman who's come in with some pretty concerning symptoms.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's dealing with epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and even acute kidney injury.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's quite a mix of issues.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She mentioned that these problems started about three weeks ago with things like fever, joint pains, and stomach troubles, which she thought might be just a bad case of viral gastroenteritis.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But then, two weeks later, her stomach pain got worse, and she started having more frequent and severe bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That doesn't sound like a simple virus anymore.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, I'm thinking, could this be something more serious?

One month before this presentation, the patient was seen at the outpatient gynecology clinic of another hospital. She reported a 3-year history of hair growth on her face, as well as a 1-year history of prominent symptoms, including increased hair growth on her abdomen, hair loss primarily on the top of her head, deepening of her voice, growth of skin tags on her neck and breast, and an increased libido. Laboratory testing revealed elevated total and free testosterone levels and a normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) level. A Papanicolaou test was negative for intraepithelial lesions and cancer, and testing for high-risk human papillomavirus was negative. Twenty-one days before this presentation, the patient was seen at a second hospital by an endocrinologist, who completed an evaluation and ordered a comprehensive panel of laboratory tests to evaluate her hyperandrogenism. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Five days later, a 24-hour urine collection contained 6.0 \u03bcg of cortisol (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0) in a 1050-ml sample. One week later, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed and revealed diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver without focal hepatic lesions, a nonobstructing stone (3 mm in diameter, with a density of approximately 300 Hounsfield units) in the interpolar region of the right kidney, surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa that were consistent with cholecystectomy, and degenerative changes in the visualized skeleton, with no splenomegaly, adrenal nodules, or lymphadenopathy. After these imaging and laboratory evaluations were performed, the patient was seen in the outpatient gynecology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Laboratory Data. The patient was gravida 3, para 3, with normal pregnancies; menses had begun at 12 years of age and had occurred every 40 to 60 days thereafter until menopause, which had occurred 3 years before this presentation. Postmenopausal bleeding had recently occurred. In addition, the patient had hypothyroidism, hypertension, interstitial cystitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, degenerative osteoarthritis (for which multiple glucocorticoid injections had been administered to the knees), carpal tunnel syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, an erythematous rash on the face, including the nasolabial folds (which had lasted for several years and, on dermatologic evaluation 2 years earlier, was not thought to be typical of systemic lupus erythematosus), and a positive antinuclear antibody test (speckled and centromere pattern, 1:160 dilution). She had had two cesarean sections, a total hip replacement, a cholecystectomy, and a tonsillectomy. Medications included levothyroxine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, hydroxyzine, calcium, vitamin D, ibuprofen, biotin, and folate. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and had adult children. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her mother had died at 69 years of age and had had hypertension and breast cancer, one brother had diabetes mellitus, and another brother had hypertension and hyperlipidemia; there was no family history of gynecologic cancer. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/86 mm Hg, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the temperature 36.6\u00b0C, and the weight 103.2 kg. There was growth of dark brown terminal hair on the upper lip, chin, submental region, and neck and hair loss on the frontal region and vertex of the scalp. A pelvic examination revealed normal female external genitalia, without clitoromegaly, cervical motion tenderness, uterine pain, or adnexal pain, fullness, or masses. The remainder of the examination was normal. The white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and red-cell indexes were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase and results of coagulation and renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until approximately 8 months before this presentation, when she noted shortness of breath while jogging her usual 4 miles daily. During the next 7 months, her symptoms gradually worsened until she became winded within 7 minutes after starting to jog or after climbing stairs, with associated leg fatigue. Approximately 1 month before this evaluation, she was seen at an outpatient clinic of another hospital. On examination, the vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The oropharyngeal mucosa had a cobblestone appearance, and there were scattered inspiratory wheezes throughout the lung fields. The peak expiratory flow rate measured 400 liters per minute (predicted value, 470). A chest radiograph showed reticular linear peripheral opacities predominantly involving the upper lung zones, without pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Results of electrocardiography were normal. Fluticasone (two puffs at a strength of 110 \u03bcg per puff, by inhalation twice daily) and an albuterol inhaler with a spacer were prescribed for use before exercise. Five days later, results of pulmonary-function tests and the blood level of D-dimer were normal. The initial chest radiograph showed mild volume loss, biapical pleural thickening, and peripheral nodular opacities in the upper lung zones (Figure 1). One week later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, confirmed the presence of bilateral peripheral nodules, which were broad-based and associated with nodular pleural thickening extending into the fissures. Linear bands in the parenchyma were seen adjacent to many peripheral nodules. A few peripheral opacities were present in the middle lung zone, but no abnormalities were seen in the lower lung zone. There was no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Radiographs of the Chest.Chest radiographs obtained in posteroanterior (Panel A) and lateral (Panel B) views show pleuroparenchymal opacities (Panel A, arrows) in the upper lung zones. The patient was referred to the outpatient pulmonary clinic of this hospital. She reported no orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, pedal edema, cough, sputum production, rash, chills, chest pressure, palpitations, change in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. She had osteopenia, migraine headaches, hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, intermittent mildly elevated aminotransferase levels, and breast calcifications; she had undergone excision of an adenomatous colonic polyp 2 years previously, as well as sinus surgery and a tonsillectomy in the distant past. Additional medications included alendronate, simvastatin, and lorazepam (as needed for insomnia). She had no known allergies. She worked in an office. She drank wine occasionally, had stopped smoking 30 years earlier (after 3 years of smoking), and did not use illicit drugs. She exercised daily, walking and jogging 4 miles. Her father had cardiac arrhythmias, a sister had breast cancer, another sister possibly had systemic lupus erythematosus, a brother had type 1 diabetes mellitus, one of her children had diabetes mellitus, and another one of her children had a supraventricular arrhythmia. The physical examination was normal, without wheezing, cyanosis, clubbing, or lymphadenopathy. Results of pulmonary-function tests were normal; the forced vital capacity (FVC) was 3.45 liters (101% of the predicted value), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 2.62 liters (97%), the ratio of FEV1to FVC 0.76, the total lung capacity 5.30 liters (97%), and the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 22.4 (92%). The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), the level of alanine aminotransferase was 60 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 30), and testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive at 1:40 dilution in a homogeneous and speckled pattern (reference range, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions). The complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal, as were the anion gap and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme; testing was negative for rheumatoid factor, IgG antibodies to anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and IgE antibodies to environmental allergens. At a follow-up examination 2.5 months later, CT of the chest, performed at this hospital after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was largely unchanged (Figure 2).

The patient had been in his usual health until approximately 1 month before admission, when cough occurred. One week later, his legs became swollen and weeping sores developed. Dyspnea on exertion without orthopnea developed and was associated with a weight gain of 7 kg. The patient was seen by his primary care physician at another hospital. On examination, a new cardiac murmur was heard. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Therapy with furosemide and lisinopril was begun, and echocardiography and chest imaging studies were scheduled. Four days before this admission, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed at another hospital, revealed diffuse bulky lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and both hilar regions, fine reticular lung markings, evidence of previous granulomatous disease in the right middle lobe, an enlarged heart, a thyroid nodule, and ill-defined enlargement of the left adrenal gland. Laboratory Data. On the morning of admission, while the patient was boarding a plane for an early flight, light-headedness suddenly developed. Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness and fell to the aisle on his left side; he had no head trauma. His wife estimated that he was unconscious, with open eyes and jerking movements, for approximately 10 minutes. After regaining consciousness, he reported no chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, urinary or fecal incontinence, or confusion. He was brought to this hospital by emergency medical services personnel. The patient had not eaten that morning. He had had hypertension for approximately 3 years. Medications included carvedilol, lisinopril, furosemide, and aspirin. He had no known allergies. He was married and traveled frequently for work. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not use illicit drugs; he had a history of cigarette smoking of 50 pack-years but had stopped 5 years earlier, and he smoked cigars occasionally. His sister had Crohn\u2019s disease, but there was no family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmia, or sudden death. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented and appeared chronically ill, with bitemporal wasting. The blood pressure was 113/61 mm Hg, the pulse 53 beats per minute, the temperature 36.3\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. Prominent submandibular lymphadenopathy was present. The jugular venous pressure was 15 cm of water, and C-V waves (systolic pulsations) were observed. There were diffuse crackles at the lung bases. The rhythm was slow and regular, with an augmented second heart sound, a midpeaking systolic ejection murmur (grade 3/6) that was loudest at the base, a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternum (grade 3/6) that increased in magnitude with inspiration, and an apical holosystolic murmur (grade 3/6). A right ventricular heave and a pulsatile liver were present. Prominent inguinal lymphadenopathy was present, along with 3+ pitting edema in both legs; there was no calf tenderness, but multiple healing ulcerations were present on the lower legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The results of electrocardiography were interpreted as normal, except for evidence of probable left ventricular hypertrophy. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and lipid profile were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, troponin T, and glycated hemoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph showed a prominent right hilum with a lobulated contour, extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, and prominent interstitial markings and reticular opacities with thickening of the fissures, findings suggestive of pulmonary edema (Figure 1). An increased cardiothoracic ratio was indicative of cardiomegaly. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A chest radiograph (Panel A) shows thickening of the right paratracheal stripe and prominence of the hila, findings suggestive of lymphadenopathy; also shown are reticular interstitial opacities, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema. A chest CT scan, obtained according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol at maximum intensity projection of the right pulmonary tree (Panel B) and the left pulmonary arterial tree (Panel C), shows mediastinal and hilar adenopathy (asterisks) and normal filling of the pulmonary arteries without filling defects, findings that indicate an absence of pulmonary embolism; punctate calcifications, which are present bilaterally, correspond to calcified granulomas. An axial CT scan, obtained through the upper ventricular septum and left ventricular outflow tract during systole (Panel D), shows relative thickening of the upper basal septum (asterisk) and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet (arrow). A coronal reconstruction CT scan (Panel E) shows right parasternal adenopathy and bilateral hilar adenopathy (arrows). CT of the chest, performed according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol, did not reveal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, and therefore pulmonary embolism was an unlikely diagnosis (Figure 1). Multiple densely calcified pulmonary nodules were present in both lower lobes and along the right minor fissure; these findings were consistent with previous granulomatous disease. Persistent bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy was also present. The pulmonary artery was enlarged at 3.5 cm, a finding consistent with pulmonary hypertension possibly due to back pressure resulting from congestion on the left side. The left ventricle and left atrium were enlarged. Coronary atherosclerotic calcifications and mitral annular and aortic calcifications were present, along with flowing anterior osteophytes at multiple levels of the thoracic spine that were consistent with DISH (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis); there were no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Although the CT scan was not electrocardiogram-gated, the basal ventricular septum appeared hypertrophied relative to the adjacent myocardium. There was a suggestion of systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet in an axial slice that appeared to be acquired during systole (Figure 1). During the next 3 days, testing for myocardial infarction and a skin test for tuberculosis were negative. Carvedilol therapy was stopped because of bradycardia with pauses longer than 3 seconds, but the patient was noted to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. Lisinopril was administered once and then switched to captopril. Echocardiography was performed. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with upper septal predominance (thickness of the septum, 24 mm; thickness of the posterior wall, 16 mm; normal thickness for both, \u226411 mm), a finding consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle was hyperkinetic, with an ejection fraction of 81% and near obliteration of the midventricular and apical cavity. There was systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet, and a left ventricular outflow tract gradient was estimated to be more than 100 mm Hg at rest; both findings are consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (Figure 2). Extensive mitral annular calcification encroached on the posterior mitral-valve leaflet, and this resulted in moderate mitral-valve stenosis with a peak transmitral gradient of 21 mm Hg and a mean gradient of 8 mm Hg. There was a flail portion of the posterior mitral-valve leaflet, with severe mitral regurgitation and a dilated left atrium. No obvious valvular vegetations were present. There was severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 122 mm Hg and interventricular septal compression; the right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypokinetic. Echocardiographic Images.A transthoracic echocardiographic image taken from the apical four-chamber view (Panel A) shows asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and upper septal predominance (arrows), as well as systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet (arrowhead); these findings are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Extensive mitral annular calcification encroaching upon the posterior mitral-valve leaflet results in moderate mitral-valve stenosis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (Panel B) shows the flail tip of the posterior mitral-valve leaflet with an associated chordal remnant (arrow); there was associated severe mitral regurgitation, with an eccentric jet that was primarily anteriorly directed (arrowhead). On the fourth day, a transesophageal echocardiogram again showed marked asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. The tip of the middle scallop of the posterior mitral-valve leaflet was flail, with an associated chordal remnant. There was severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentrically directed jet, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. (Figure 2) On the fifth day, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population.

The patient had been in her usual health until 4 months before this presentation, when she noted a small, tender lump in the left breast on self-examination. Evaluation by her primary care physician revealed a firm, slightly mobile mass (measuring 5 mm in greatest dimension) in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. The skin overlying the mass appeared normal, and there was no nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy. The right breast and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Three days earlier, routine laboratory tests had been performed by her nephrologist; the test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Three days later, combined digital mammography and tomosynthesis of the left breast was negative, with no suspicious masses, areas of architectural distortion, or microcalcifications (Figure 1). Ultrasonography targeted to the 10 o\u2019clock position in the left breast revealed a superficial, hyperechoic, oval mass (measuring 6 mm in greatest dimension) with circumscribed margins that was located 5 cm from the nipple, in the dermis. The radiologic differential diagnosis included a sebaceous cyst, and the mass was thought to be probably benign. A plan was made to perform follow-up imaging in 6 months. Imaging Studies of the Left Breast, Obtained at the Time of the Initial Presentation.A mammogram from a craniocaudal view (Panel A) and a mediolateral oblique view (Panel B) shows no mammographic abnormality at the site of the palpable abnormality, in the upper inner quadrant, which is indicated by the metallic markers (white dots). Two months later, the patient was seen for routine follow-up in the nephrology and rheumatology clinics of this hospital. She reported fatigue, nausea, and epigastric pain. Mild epigastric tenderness was present; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. One month later, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of pancreatitis; there was a new, indeterminate, hyperdense lesion (measuring 1.9 cm in greatest dimension) in the upper pole of the left kidney. Four months after the patient\u2019s initial presentation, she was seen in the gynecology clinic of this hospital for a routine annual examination. She reported that pain in the left breast had developed 5 days earlier and that she had noted a lump in the upper outer quadrant. The pain had been persistent, was present throughout the breast, was worst near the nipple, and was unaffected by movement or change in position. The patient had systemic lupus erythematosus with associated nephritis and chronic renal insufficiency, as well as cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, arthralgias, anemia, leukopenia, and a positive test for serum anticardiolipin antibodies. She also had migraine headaches, depression, gastritis, uterine fibroids, allergic rhinitis, gout, and lateral epicondylitis. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and menopause when she was 47 years of age. The patient was nulliparous and had not taken hormone-replacement therapy. She had undergone surgery for skin ulcers on the legs 15 years earlier, bilateral cataract removal 14 years earlier, treatment forHelicobacter pyloriinfection 9 years earlier, endoscopic resection of a left nasopharyngeal cyst 5 years earlier, and arthroscopic surgery for right shoulder impingement syndrome and arthritis of the right acromioclavicular joint 4 years earlier. Medications included hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, enalapril, metoprolol, calcium carbonate\u2013ergocalciferol, aspirin, venlafaxine, omeprazole, and nasal ipratropium, as well as colchicine as needed. The patient had no known allergies to medications; leukopenia had occurred with the administration of mycophenolate. She had emigrated from Brazil 25 years earlier and frequently returned there to visit relatives and friends. She was unemployed and lived with a roommate in a suburban area of New England. She had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for 19 years but had stopped smoking 17 years before this evaluation. She drank alcohol on rare occasions and did not use illicit drugs. Her father had had diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer disease, and nephrolithiasis and had died of sepsis; her mother had had hypertension and had died after a hip fracture. Her maternal grandfather had had gastric cancer, and a paternal aunt had had unspecified gynecologic cancer that was diagnosed when she was 38 years of age. On examination, the patient appeared well. A firm, mildly tender mass (measuring 3 cm by 3 cm) was present in the left breast, between the 2 and 3 o\u2019clock positions; it had no overlying skin abnormalities. A second, smaller mass was located at the 10 o\u2019clock position. There was no nipple discharge or axillary lymphadenopathy. The right breast and the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Pathological examination of a specimen obtained during a Papanicolaou smear revealed atrophic changes and no evidence of an intraepithelial lesion or cancer. Two days later, combined digital mammography and tomosynthesis revealed focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast that had not been present on a previous mammogram and corresponded to the palpable abnormality (Figure 2); no suspicious masses, calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion were seen in the right breast. Ultrasonography targeted to the 2 o\u2019clock position in the left breast revealed an irregular, hypoechoic mass (measuring 20 mm by 20 mm by 19 mm) located 9 cm from the nipple and situated in a background of tissue with heterogeneous echotexture that encompassed the majority of the upper outer quadrant (Figure 2). Imaging Studies of the Left Breast, Obtained at the Time of the Current Presentation.A mammogram from a craniocaudal view (Panel A) and a mediolateral oblique view (Panel B) shows new focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant (arrows), a finding that corresponds to the palpable abnormality, which is indicated by the metallic markers (white dots). An ultrasound image in a transverse plane (Panel C) shows an irregular, hypoechoic mass (measuring 20 mm by 20 mm by 19 mm) (arrow) located at the 2 o\u2019clock position, 9 cm from the nipple; this finding also corresponds to the palpable abnormality.

He had had Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma of the left calf and palate 8 years previously that resolved after treatment with bleomycin; in addition, he had had molluscum contagiosum, anal dysplasia, pulmonaryMycobacterium aviumcomplex infection (which was diagnosed 9 years earlier and for which he received 18 months of treatment), pneumocystis pneumonia, thrush, preseptal cellulitis, and diarrhea caused by cryptosporidium. He also had had transiently elevated results of liver-function tests 3 years earlier that were thought to be caused by fatty liver disease or alcoholic liver disease. A test for toxoplasma IgG antibodies, which was performed shortly after he received the diagnosis of HIV infection, was negative, as were multiple rapid plasma reagin tests, which were performed between 8 and 5 years before this presentation; he had no known history of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Medications included emtricitabine, tenofovir, and rilpivirine in combination. He was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which had caused hemolytic anemia. The patient was heterosexual and divorced and lived with his female partner, who was also HIV-positive and receiving ART. His most recent sexual activity with his partner had reportedly occurred 2 years earlier, with condom use, and he reported no other recent sexual activity. He had smoked cigarettes for 30 years (and continued to do so), drank one or two alcoholic beverages daily, and did not use illicit drugs. He worked in the construction industry. He had a 22-year-old cat, for which he changed the litter; he did not recall any bites or scratches. He had traveled to Oklahoma approximately 6 months before this presentation. He was of white European ancestry. His father had coronary artery disease, and his mother had fibromyalgia; his siblings and adult children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 155/79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft, without tenderness or distention. The patient had inguinal hernias (larger on the left side than on the right side) that were easily reducible, with minimal tenderness in the inguinal canal on scrotal invagination. There was bulky and slightly tender lymphadenopathy, including three large lymph nodes (maximum diameter, 3 cm) in the left inguinal region. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of tests of renal function and coagulation were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and lipids; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left common iliac, left external iliac, and left inguinal regions (Figure 1), with associated stranding in the soft tissues of the anterior pelvic walls. Areas of hypodensity consistent with necrosis were seen in a left external iliac node, measuring 2.4 cm in the short-axis diameter, and in a partially visualized left inguinal node, measuring 2.2 cm in the short-axis diameter; small paraaortic and right inguinal nodes (<1 cm in diameter) were also seen. There were small, fat-containing bilateral inguinal hernias; the hernia on the left side was larger than the hernia on the right side (3.8 cm and 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, respectively). There was enlargement of the liver (span, 22 cm), with the inferior tip reaching below the iliac crest, and borderline enlargement of the spleen, which measured 12.8 cm in length. Nonobstructing renal calculi were visualized on the left side; there was no evidence of bowel strangulation or obstruction. Abdominal CT Scans.Axial (Panels A and B) and coronal (Panel C) images from CT scans that were obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material show lymphadenopathy in the left iliac and left inguinal regions. An enlarged lymph node in the left external iliac region (Panel A, arrow) measures 2.4 cm in the short-axis dimension, and a partially visualized lymph node in the left inguinal region (Panel B, arrow) measures 2.2 cm in the short-axis dimension. Both of these nodes contain an area of hypodensity consistent with necrosis. Other enlarged lymph nodes were also seen in the left inguinal region (Panel C, ellipse), as was enlargement of the liver (Panel C).

The patient had been well until approximately 4 months before this presentation, when pain with defecation developed. He typically had one bowel movement each day and noted bright red blood on the toilet paper after wiping, although blood did not appear to be mixed in with the stool itself. The patient had not had abdominal pain or weight loss. On the sixth day of illness, he was seen by his primary care physician. The patient reported that he had had a sexual encounter with a man approximately 6 weeks earlier. On examination, a tender external hemorrhoid was noted; the vital signs and the remainder of the examination were normal. Tests were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Psyllium, naproxen, and topical hydrocortisone cream were prescribed. Approximately 10 weeks later, the patient returned to the primary care clinic and reported that rectal pain and bleeding with defecation had persisted. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 126/76 mm Hg. Bleeding hemorrhoids were noted around the anal opening; the remainder of the examination was normal. Psyllium, naproxen, and topical hydrocortisone cream were continued, and the patient was referred to the colorectal surgery clinic at this hospital. At the surgery clinic, the patient reported that the rectal pain and bleeding persisted and that he had not noted any protrusion of tissue through the anus. His medications included naproxen, as needed, and hydrocortisone cream applied topically to the anus, which had provided only minimal pain relief. He had no known allergies. He had emigrated from Brazil 16 years earlier and now lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. He worked in construction and did not smoke tobacco. He was bisexual; he reported that he had never had a sexually transmitted infection. His mother had hypertension. There was no family history of colorectal cancer. The patient appeared well. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen was normal. At the anterior and posterior midline anal verge, there were large, superficial anal fissures and small-to-moderate-sized distal sentinel skin tags. Results of a digital rectal examination were normal except for the presence of moderate tenderness. Anoscopy revealed the fissures and small internal hemorrhoids.

The patient had been in her usual health until 14 days before this evaluation, when a piece of meat became stuck in an orthodontic palate expander that had been inserted 19 days earlier and she thought she might choke. She was able to dislodge the meat shortly thereafter, but during the next 7 days, she reportedly had an intense fear of swallowing, ate very carefully, and had an associated decrease in her food intake. On the 7th day after the choking incident, she stopped eating most solid foods; thereafter, she consumed only milkshakes, liquid dietary supplements, and, occasionally, yogurt and oatmeal. She reported that she was unable to eat solid food because she was \u201cafraid I can\u2019t chew it up enough to swallow it so I don\u2019t choke\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to chew like I used to.\u201d One day before this evaluation, her orthodontist removed the palate expander. However, the swallowing difficulty persisted; she was unable to swallow small pieces of chicken or a single grain of rice. On the day of this evaluation, the patient consumed only a spoonful of oatmeal (which she had previously been willing to eat), a half can of a liquid dietary supplement, and a small amount of water and juice. Her parents noted that she chewed food with her front teeth but appeared to be unable to move the food from the front of her mouth to the back to swallow it. Her weight had decreased by 1.4 kg since an examination performed 2 months earlier, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was below the 1st percentile. Her parents were worried about acute malnutrition and dehydration. They requested an urgent evaluation in the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program outpatient clinic at this hospital, and from there, the patient was referred to the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine clinic at this hospital. During a psychiatric evaluation of the patient, her parents reported that she had been a highly selective eater since infancy, had cried the first time she ate solid food, and had frequently required coaxing from her parents to complete meals. The patient disliked many foods (including artichokes, asparagus, meatballs, pasta sauce, hamburger buns, and sandwiches) because of their taste or texture or because they were \u201cmixed together.\u201d These strict preferences had severely limited the available food choices for the family\u2019s dinners and affected the patient\u2019s ability to socialize with friends. Her BMI had been as low as the one tenth percentile and had been consistently below the 1st percentile during recent years, including during her most recent examination 2 months earlier (Figure 1). Cyproheptadine had been administered the previous year but was stopped after only transient improvement in her appetite because of lethargy. The patient did not report that she felt fat; she noted, \u201cIf anything, I worry that I\u2019m too skinny. I\u2019m one of the smallest in my class,\u201d and she stated her desired weight to be average or a little lower than average. She reported no history of binge eating, self-induced vomiting, or use of laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills. She also reported no symptoms of pica or rumination disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, phobias (besides fear of choking), substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder. As a young child, she had constipation, for which she had been seen by a gastroenterologist at another hospital and had briefly received treatment with polyethylene glycol, fiber, and a stimulant laxative. She had been seen intermittently by nutritionists at another hospital since she was 6 years of age. At the other hospital, testing for celiac disease was reportedly negative. She took no medications currently and was allergic to penicillin, which had caused hives. She lived with her parents and younger siblings; she was a student who did well academically and had many friends and hobbies. There was a family history of depression. The Patient\u2019s Growth Chart and Body-Mass Index.The chart shows the patient\u2019s height and weight (top and bottom, respectively) relative to average values among girls in her age group. The table inset shows the patient\u2019s body-mass index, which is below the 1st percentile. On medical examination, the temperature was 38\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the blood pressure and pulse were 107/70 mm Hg and 114 beats per minute while she was in the supine position and 95/72 mm Hg and 123 beats per minute while she was standing. The weight was 26.5 kg, and the BMI 12.5. There were no oral petechiae, and sexual development was classified as Tanner stage 2 (with stages ranging from 1 to 5 and higher stages indicating more advanced pubertal development); the remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level, hematocrit, platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, globulin, and thyrotropin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of higher than 1.030, a pH of 6.0, and 4+ ketones and 1+ protein by dipstick. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 beats per minute, with a PR interval of 116 msec, a corrected QT interval of 422 msec, and evidence of an incomplete right bundle-branch block.

Six years before the current evaluation, the patient received a diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma of the left shoulder. He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with resection of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resection cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab. Four months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizumab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coronary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later. When the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night. Although there was no change in appetite or eating habits, he had lost 5 kg of weight in the previous 3 weeks. There was no headache or change in vision. On examination, the temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no murmur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. The patient lived in New England and was a retired police officer. His father, sister, and brother had had melanoma. There was no family history of diabetes. A complete blood count, the results of liver-function tests, and the blood thyrotropin level were normal. The blood glucose level was 505 mg per deciliter (28.03 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.89 to 6.11 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included intravenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapentin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation. Later that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital. In the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Figure 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pallidus, a finding suggestive of infarction. Initial Imaging Studies.A frontal chest radiograph (Panel A) shows diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs, with relative sparing of the lung apexes. A coronal CT image of the chest (Panel B) shows diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the lung apexes and of the peripheral subpleural lung (arrows). An axial CT image of the head (Panel C) shows mild diffuse cerebral edema and effacement of the sulci and basilar cisterns (arrows). A coronal reformatted CT image of the head (Panel D) shows effacement of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces extending to the vertex (arrows), with preserved gray\u2013white matter differentiation. Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted. The next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The troponin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, carboxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests forLegionella pneumophilaandStreptococcus pneumoniaeurinary antigens were negative. Later that afternoon, the patient was transferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron-deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Regular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications included tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of cardiopulmonary or neurologic disorders. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg while the patient was receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 \u03bcg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator in volume-control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approximated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic examination with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to visually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities in both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and ammonia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxicologic screening was negative except for the presence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An electrocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminutive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in consolidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema. A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neurologic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered. Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left globus pallidus that had not changed from the previous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was probably an artifact.

The patient had been generally well until 6 years before presentation, when weight loss and pelvic pain developed and she requested HIV testing at a government clinic. HIV-antibody testing was positive. Four years 3 months before presentation, the CD4+ T-cell count was 193 cells per cubic millimeter (Table 1), indicating that the patient was eligible for antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Botswana. The white-cell count was 3400 cells per cubic millimeter (reference range, 3900 to 8600), and the blood level of creatinine was 0.41 mg per deciliter (36 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.45 to 0.81 mg per deciliter [40 to 72 \u03bcmol per liter]). Two months later, treatment with a combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz was begun. At a follow-up appointment 1 month later, a gynecologic examination was performed to evaluate vaginal discharge, urinary frequency, and dysuria. Abnormalities were reported, and administration of a 10-day course of amoxicillin was begun. Pathological examination of the specimen obtained during a screening Papanicolaou (Pap) test revealed a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; however, the patient never received this result. Four months after the initiation of ART, the CD4+ T-cell count had improved (Table 1). Laboratory Data. One month later (5 months after the initiation of ART), the patient again reported dysuria; a course of nalidixic acid was administered. During the next 18 months, she continued to have recurrent pelvic pain, dysuria, and vaginal discharge. She sought care from traditional healers for these symptoms and postponed reporting the symptoms to her medical caregivers and undergoing a repeat Pap test, since she believed that the traditional therapies would help; the symptoms did not improve. Approximately 13 months before this presentation, the patient reported vaginal pruritus. Speculum examination revealed white patches on the cervix, and a repeat Pap test revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. One month later, on review of the test results, colposcopic examination with biopsy was scheduled for the next available appointment, which was 14 months later. Approximately 10 months before this presentation, a small amount of vaginal bleeding reportedly occurred each time the patient had sexual intercourse; the patient was referred for gynecologic evaluation. One month before this presentation, the complete blood count, the creatinine level, and tests of liver function were normal; other results are shown inTable 1. She returned to the HIV clinic for evaluation. The patient reported no dyspareunia. She had undergone menarche at 15 years of age and first had sexual intercourse after the age of 17 years, and she was gravida 7, para 5. Medications included tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz; she had no known allergies. She lived in an urban area in Botswana with her five children and their father (who was also receiving ART for HIV infection). She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed periodically in a small shop. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the abdomen was soft, without distention, rebound, or palpable masses. On pelvic examination, there were ulcers at the introitus; a malodorous, fungating lesion, 6 cm by 2 cm, on the right lateral vaginal wall, extending from the fornix to the introitus, with minimal bleeding on contact; and a nodular cervix.

Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative. Sixteen days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 38 weeks 1 day of gestation. She was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 13,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0); treatment with intravenous penicillin was started. On hospital day 2, an epidural anesthetic agent was administered. Artificial rupture of the membranes revealed clear, odorless fluid, and infusion of oxytocin was started. Six hours after artificial rupture of the membranes, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. Three minutes later, the placenta was delivered intact. Immediately after delivery, hemorrhage due to uterine atony occurred; there was an estimated blood loss of 500 ml. Bimanual massage of the uterus was performed, and oxytocin and methylergonovine were administered; hemostasis was subsequently achieved. A perineal laceration was repaired. The patient began breast-feeding, and on postpartum day 1, she was discharged. Six days before the current admission, on postpartum day 9, pain in the left upper quadrant developed. The pain was dull, radiated to the left flank and back, and was worse with movement and deep breathing. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic; urine was obtained for culture, and empirical treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started. Five days before this admission, on postpartum day 10, abdominal pain persisted, and a fever with a temporal temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed. The patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She rated the abdominal pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A review of systems was notable for nausea and minimal lochia; there was no diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or breast tenderness. On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness on palpation of the left upper quadrant, the uterine fundus, the suprapubic region, and the left costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination, including examination with the use of a speculum, revealed no dehiscence, drainage, or hematoma at the site of the perineal laceration repair and no discharge from the cervical os; there was mild cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 20,700 per microliter. The level of hemoglobin was 11.4 g per deciliter. Blood cultures were obtained. The urine culture obtained at the urgent care clinic was positive for group B streptococcus. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for presumed pyelonephritis. On hospital day 3, when the fever and abdominal pain resolved, the patient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin.

Six weeks before this admission, the patient began to have headaches that were not characteristic of her previous migraines. She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phonophobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort. One week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres (Figure 1A); a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. Imaging Studies of the Head and Spine.An axial CT image of the head (Panel A), obtained without the administration of contrast material on presentation to another hospital, shows areas of hypodensity in the cerebellar white matter, dentate nucleus, and dorsal brain stem (long arrow), as well as hydrocephalus with dilatation of the temporal horns (short arrow). An axial T2-weighted image from MRI of the head (Panel B) that was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material at approximately the time of admission to this hospital shows elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain (not shown in this view), dorsal pons (arrowhead), middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (arrow). A sagittal T1-weighted sequence from the same MRI study (Panel C), obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows narrowing and effacement of the fourth ventricular outlet with nodular enhancement (arrow) and enlargement and entrapment of the fourth ventricle (arrowhead). An axial T1-weighted image from MRI of the head (Panel D) that was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material a few days after admission shows diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement surrounding the brain stem (arrow) with enhancement along the lower cranial nerves (arrowhead). A sagittal T2-weighted three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS) image from MRI of the head (Panel E) shows multiple septations within the third ventricle, including the floor (long arrows) as well as the fourth ventricular outlet (short arrow). A sagittal T1-weighted image of the spine (Panel F) obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material on the fourth hospital day shows diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (arrow). On arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral buprenorphine\u2013naloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibuprofen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the patient was alert, interactive, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompanied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the cranial-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (Figure 1B). There was obstructive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Figure 1C). There was also leptomeningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves. Treatment with intravenous acetazolamide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient underwent stereotactically guided endoscopic exploration of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF specimen obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal. Dexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples forMycobacterium tuberculosiswas negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells. On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (Figure 1F). On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis revealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously recorded from the clamped external ventricular drain.

The patient was born by vaginal delivery after a full-term uncomplicated gestation. He was noted to have an undescended testis. He received diagnoses of gastroesophageal reflux disease and failure to thrive at infancy, followed by type 1 diabetes mellitus (at 2 years of age), primary hypothyroidism (at 4 years of age), mild speech delay, learning disabilities, recurrent infections (including sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and pneumonias), nocturia, and leukoplakia of the tongue. At 2 years of age, he underwent genetic evaluation at another hospital, and the chromosomes were reportedly normal. When the patient was 10 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A) was performed because of chronic headaches and nausea. The images showed numerous nonspecific, nonenhancing lesions (measuring \u22648 mm in diameter) in the bilateral periventricular and corona radiata white matter. Results of magnetic resonance angiography were normal. Imaging Studies.An MRI study was performed when the patient was 10 years of age. An axial, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) shows numerous nonspecific focal lesions (measuring \u22648 mm in diameter) throughout the periventricular and corona radiata white matter (arrow); the lesions did not show enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium. These findings are nonspecific and can be caused by myelination disorders, vasculitis, and certain infections, such as Lyme disease. Further imaging studies were performed when the patient initially presented to the gastroenterology clinic, at 14 years of age. A sagittal ultrasound image of the right hepatic lobe (Panel B) shows heterogeneously hypoechoic parenchymal nodules (measuring \u22641 cm in diameter) (arrows) but no dominant mass; the appearance is reminiscent of macronodular cirrhosis. A color Doppler ultrasound image (Panel C) shows a patent portal vein with normal waveforms and flow velocity. A sagittal ultrasound image of the spleen (Panel D) shows splenomegaly but no evidence of varices. An axial, T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, fat-saturated image obtained on MRI of the abdomen (Panel E) shows heterogeneous hepatic parenchymal enhancement. A coronal, T2-weighted image obtained on MRI of the abdomen (Panel F) confirms the presence of splenomegaly without evidence of varices or ascites (arrows); the bile ducts were not dilated. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of vitamin B12and C-reactive protein, and antinuclear antibody titers were reportedly normal. A monospot test was negative, as was testing for Lyme disease and DNA for CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). The patient was seen by neurologists at a second hospital; he reportedly had no seizure disorder. When the patient was 13 years of age, laboratory testing revealed normal blood levels of total protein and albumin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Between 13 years 6 months of age and 14 years 6 months of age, the patient\u2019s prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, lipid profile, and red-cell osmotic fragility were normal, as were blood levels of ceruloplasmin, iron, iron-binding capacity, IgG, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and the 24-hour urinary copper level. A Coombs\u2019 test, screening for celiac disease and Heinz bodies, and tests for hepatitis B and C viruses, antinuclear antibodies, anti\u2013liver\u2013kidney microsomal antibodies, and F-actin smooth-muscle antibodies were negative; other test results obtained in an outpatient clinic and at the second hospital are shown inTable 1. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed 97.3% hemoglobin A1and 2.3% hemoglobin A2. Ophthalmologic examination revealed no evidence of retinopathy. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient had a history of inguinal herniorrhaphies and had undergone orchidopexy at 15 months of age. He also had had orthopedic injuries related to sports traumas. Results of a sweat test (performed at 18 months of age), a bone-age study (at 20 months of age), and a tongue biopsy (at 12 years of age) were reportedly normal. Medications included insulin (by pump) and levothyroxine. He had no known allergies to medications. He attended special-education classes in high school and lived with his parents and siblings. His mother and father were both of Italian and Irish ancestry. A maternal uncle had been born prematurely and had a history of learning disabilities, developmental delay, hypogammaglobulinemia (that required infusions of intravenous immune globulin), cryptogenic cirrhosis (that had been diagnosed when he was 30 years of age and was complicated by the hepatopulmonary syndrome), splenic-artery aneurysms, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and bone marrow failure; he died in his 40s. A maternal great-grandmother was reported to have scleroderma that had developed when she was in her 80s, his paternal grandmother had type 1 diabetes mellitus that had developed when she was in her teens, his mother had Graves\u2019 disease, his father had non\u2013insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and his teenage siblings were healthy. On examination, the patient had slight facial dysmorphism. His height was in the 32nd percentile, and his weight in the 33rd percentile. There was a white plaque with shallow ulceration on the tongue. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with a palpable spleen three fingerbreadths below the left costal margin and no hepatomegaly. Blood levels of lactate and pyruvate and sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 were normal. Results of additional blood tests that were performed at the second hospital when the patient was 14 years 8.5 months of age are shown inTable 1. Abdominal ultrasonography (Figure 1B and 1D), performed to evaluate for splenomegaly, revealed heterogeneous echotexture in the liver, with multiple hypoechoic nodules (measuring \u22641 cm in diameter) but no dominant mass. The spleen was enlarged (measuring 14.8 cm in greatest dimension). Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1C) revealed normal hepatopetal flow of the portal and splenic veins and no evidence of splenic or gastroesophageal varices or ascites. MRI of the liver (Figure 1E and 1F), performed with and without the administration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed splenomegaly and heterogeneous hepatic enhancement, without a focal mass, bile-duct dilatation, or varices. Ursodiol was administered. Two months after the patient initially presented to the gastroenterology clinic, array comparative genomic hybridization testing revealed no notable copy-number changes. Three months after the patient initially presented to the gastroenterology clinic, he was electively admitted to this hospital for further evaluation of liver abnormalities.

The patient, who lived and worked in a city in Vietnam, had been well until approximately 1 month before the current admission, when episodes of throbbing discomfort in the right upper quadrant (described as \u201crolling spasms\u201d) developed; the episodes lasted for approximately 20 to 30 minutes at a time and resolved without treatment after 5 days. Approximately 2.5 weeks before the current admission, fevers, shaking chills, and body aches developed; the patient took ibuprofen but the symptoms did not improve. The next day, he was seen by a physician at an infirmary for international persons. Acetaminophen was administered; the fever reportedly abated, and the patient returned home. During the night, the temperature rose to 40.6\u00b0C, with rigors. He returned to the infirmary and was admitted to one of two inpatient beds. The patient had previously been well. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He was married and had two young children. He was born in and had lived in New England until 10 years earlier, when he moved to Vietnam. He was a professor at an academic institution in Massachusetts. He lived in an urban apartment complex and took occasional trips to Cambodia and New England. He had not traveled during the previous month. He had received all the indicated vaccines before moving to Vietnam and had had no recent exposure to sick persons. A physical examination was reportedly normal. The bilirubin level was reportedly mildly elevated, and laboratory tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria, antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),Salmonella typhiH and O antigens,S. paratyphiAH and BH antigens, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, parasites, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, antigens to influenza virus types A and B, and group A streptococcal pharyngitis; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis and a chest radiograph were normal. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and omeprazole were administered, without improvement. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose intermittently to 41.0\u00b0C, with rigors. A transthoracic echocardiogram reportedly showed trace mitral regurgitation and mild left atrial dilatation. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a mildly enlarged liver (midclavicular longitudinal dimension, 17 to 18 cm; upper limit of normal, 13 to 15 cm) and splenomegaly (length of the spleen, 14.9 cm). On the third day at the infirmary, results of computed tomography (CT) of the chest were normal; CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed an enlarged liver and spleen. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. On the fourth day at the infirmary, fevers persisted. On the recommendation of a physician in Massachusetts, the patient was transferred to an international hospital in Thailand. On admission, the blood pressure was 140/78 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the temperature 38.1\u00b0C (several hours after acetaminophen had been administered), and the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute; the remainder of the examination was normal. The activated partial-thromboplastin time and estimated glomerular filtration rate were normal, as were the red-cell indexes and blood levels of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and globulin. Tests were negative for dengue NS1 antigen, malaria (by means of polymerase-chain-reaction assay), influenza virus types A and B, HIV, IgM antibodies to chikungunya virus, and hepatitis B and C viruses; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly turbid urine, with 1+ protein and blood, urobilinogen, and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 5) and was otherwise normal. A stool examination was reportedly negative for parasites. Radiographs of the chest and paranasal sinuses were reportedly normal; a radiograph of the abdomen, obtained with the patient in an upright position, showed a small calcification at the left side of the pelvic cavity that was thought to be a phlebolith or bladder stone. CT images of the abdomen that were obtained at the infirmary were reviewed and thought to show hepatosplenomegaly. Potassium chloride was administered. During the patient\u2019s first full day at the international hospital (the seventh day of the febrile illness), abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly, a hepatic cyst (0.9 cm in diameter) at segment VI, and a hyperechoic nodule (1.7 cm in diameter) at the right lobe, anterior to the inferior vena cava, that was thought to represent a hepatic hemangioma. During the next 2 days, the temperature rose to between 38.0\u00b0C and 39.8\u00b0C. On the fourth hospital day, doxycycline therapy was begun for possible rickettsial infection. Later that day, one of three blood cultures that had been obtained on the day of admission grew gram-positive cocci in chains; the cocci were identified asStreptococcus constellatus, subspeciesconstellatus. Ceftriaxone therapy (2 g daily) was begun, and doxycycline therapy was stopped. The next day, a transesophageal echocardiogram showed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, with no evidence of endocarditis; the ejection fraction was 62%. The patient began to feel better. On the sixth hospital day, after 12 days of illness, fevers resolved. Repeat blood cultures were sterile. Blood levels of electrolytes, globulin, alpha-fetoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The physician in Massachusetts recommended that the patient undergo additional testing. On the seventh hospital day, CT of the abdomen (performed after the intravenous, oral, and rectal administration of contrast material) reportedly revealed abdominal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, multiple hypodense nodular lesions in the liver, enlargement and heterogeneous enhancement of the pancreatic head, and thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein. Specialists in hematology and gastroenterology were consulted. Endoscopic ultrasonography was scheduled, and anticoagulation was begun. The CA 19-9 level was normal. On the 11th hospital day, CT images were transmitted to this hospital for review.

The patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hospital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis. Two days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish-brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation. On the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal discharge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not recently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a diagnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Medications included finasteride, tamsulosin, carbidopa\u2013levodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grandmother and macular degeneration in his sister. On examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.9. Visual acuity without glasses was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Results of Ishihara color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse conjunctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the frontal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodium level of 125 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). Results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head and face (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tissue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and extending superiorly along the superficial soft tissue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated. CT of the Head and Face.Axial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in soft-tissue algorithm (Panels A and B) show marked edema of the left eyelids and preseptal soft tissues superficial to the left orbit (Panel A, arrows) and fluid and edema within the frontal scalp (Panel B, arrow). No postseptal inflammatory changes are present; the normal and symmetric appearance of the orbital fat is consistent with findings on a representative coronal image reconstructed in soft-tissue algorithm (Panel C). A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel D) at the same anatomical level as the representative image shows nearly complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with thickening and sclerosis of the walls of the right maxillary sinus (arrow), findings consistent with chronic sinusitis. A defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus (arrowhead) is consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses bordering the left orbit, are well aerated. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, and topical bacitracin\u2013polymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead (Figure 2). Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started. Clinical Photographs.Panel A shows a rash located predominantly in the left cranial nerve (V1) dermatomal distribution, mainly involving the left side of the forehead and left upper eyelid, with partial demarcation at the midline of the forehead (arrows). There is clinically significant edema of the eyelids, which is more pronounced on the left side than on the right side. Of note, the nose is spared. Panel B shows involvement of the frontal scalp (arrow). Panels C and D show multiple grouped and confluent violaceous eroded papules with hemorrhagic and serous crust with underlying erythema (arrows).

The patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she noticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recommended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started. Eighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngology clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluctuance, or palpable salivary stones. Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Figure 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and premolar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinic at this hospital. CT Images of the Face.Axial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel A) and in soft-tissue algorithm (Panel B) show an expansile, multiloculated mass centered in the left mandibular body (Panel B, arrows) with internal wavy septations. A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel C) shows defects in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible with involvement of the alveolar process and the left mandibular first molar. Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swelling of the left mandible (Figure 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left mandible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orthodontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal. Clinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.Frontal and submental views (Panels A and B, respectively) show the expansion of the left mandibular body laterally and inferiorly. Five days later, at the evaluation in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, the lesion had enlarged (Panels C and D). An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Figure 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma. Surgical Approach and Biopsy and Surgical Specimens.Enucleation of the mandibular lesion was performed through an intraoral incision in the buccal vestibule lateral to the teeth (Panel A). The lesion was easily separated from the thin, expanded cortical margins. The inferior alveolar nerve (arrow) was preserved. The high vascularity of the tumor imparts a red-brown appearance to the lesion that is typical of brown tumors and other giant-cell\u2013rich lesions (Panel B). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the initial maxillary tumor\u2013biopsy specimen before excision (Panel C) shows a nodule of the brown tumor that is partially surrounded by trabeculae of reactive bone. The solid tumor is hemorrhagic and contains osteoclasts. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the maxillary tumor specimen after excision (Panel D) shows that the tumor is hypercellular and is composed of spindle cells admixed with numerous osteoclasts that tend to cluster around areas of extravasated red cells. Approximately 3 weeks after excision of the tumor, parathyroidectomy was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the left upper parathyroid gland specimen (Panel E) shows an enlarged parathyroid gland that measures 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The gland weighed 1500 mg. The specimen was hypercellular, with a diffuse growth pattern, and was composed of chief cells with a rim of normocellular parathyroid tissue (Panel E, arrows). Immunohistochemical staining for parafibromin andCDC73(Panel F) shows preservation of parafibromin andCDC73by the adenomatous cells and by the cells within the rim of normocellular parathyroid tissue (arrows). Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned. On admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her paternal grandfather had died from colon cancer. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was unchanged. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells. On the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).

The patient was in his usual health until 3 weeks before admission, when painless conjunctival injection developed in the left eye, associated with dryness. He self-administered ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution, and the condition resolved. Approximately 1 week before admission, the symptoms recurred and progressively worsened. Discharge with crusting was present in both eyes in the mornings. Three days before admission, he noted loss of vision on awakening, with light perception in the left eye and blurred vision in the right eye; vision in the right eye reportedly improved slightly after the administration of ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution. Discharge from the eyes and crusting on the eyelashes persisted. On the morning of admission, a relative visited the patient at his home and took him to the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Ophthalmic abnormalities were reportedly noted. Laboratory results are shown inTable 1. A metal eye protector was placed over the left eye and normal saline was administered intravenously. He was transferred by ambulance to this hospital, for coordination of ophthalmic care with Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, which is affiliated with this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient reported that he had no ocular pain, pruritus, or grittiness and therefore had not sought evaluation earlier; reportedly it had been 1 week since he had looked in the mirror. He reported a 1-week history of pain in the right hip joint with radiation to the knee, a 3-week history of an acneiform rash on his face, and a 4-week history of rash on his lower legs. He reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, oral ulcers, direct eye inoculation, or injury. He had hypertension and a history of alcohol and illicit inhalational drug use. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. He smoked cigarettes until the onset of this illness, when he also stopped alcohol intake; he reported no illicit drug use for 3 months. He lived alone and was unemployed. He reported that his father had \u201cspine fusion disease\u201d and that an aunt had had \u201ctransient blindness.\u201d On examination, the patient appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, oriented, pale, and thin, with temporal wasting. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The height was 181 cm, the weight 63.5 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.4. Ophthalmologic examination revealed conjunctival injection in both eyes (2+ ciliary flush on the right, and diffuse 3+ injection on the left), with purulent crusting and discharge on the lashes, which was worse on the left eye (Figure 1). Punctate epithelial erosions (also known as superficial punctate keratitis) were seen diffusely on the right cornea (worse inferiorly). On the nasal side of the left cornea, there was a perforated descemetocele (corneal thinning down to the innermost layer of Descemet's membrane) measuring 8 mm by 6 mm with exposure of the uvea, as well as a suppurative corneal ulcer adjacent to the perforation temporally that measured 9 mm by 2 mm; the temporal edge of the cornea appeared hazy and edematous, without thinning. Visual acuity measured 20/200 on the right (tested with a visual acuity card held at a specific distance from the patient's face) and was graded as light perception on the left (the patient could not detect hand motion but could tell when a flashlight was turned on or off). The right pupil was 3 mm in diameter, reactive to 2 mm, with no relative afferent pupillary defect; the left pupil was obscured by purulence. Extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure in the right eye was 13 mm Hg. Photograph of the Eye.A photograph of the patient's left eye, obtained at the time of admission, shows conjunctival injection with purulent crusting and discharge on the eyelashes. On general physical examination, there were petechiae on the soft palate; follicular horny papules, perifollicular erythema, corkscrew hairs, and nonscarring alopecia on the arms; and perifollicular and nonfollicular purpuric macules and papules on the legs. A mental-status examination revealed lack of insight and a flat affect. The remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, globulin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme; toxicologic screening was negative. Other laboratory results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head performed with the administration of contrast material revealed multiple subcentimeter rim-enhancing lesions, predominantly in the submental subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2A); there was substantial fat stranding surrounding these lesions, a feature that most likely represented multiple fluid collections and raised suspicion for microabscesses. There was swelling and fat stranding in the medial canthus of the left globe. There was also left preseptal soft-tissue swelling associated with scleral thickening (Fig. 2B). These findings were compatible with periorbital cellulitis and scleritis. CT of the brain without the administration of contrast material revealed mild soft-tissue swelling and fat stranding overlying the left eye. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial acute infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. CT Images.A CT scan of the head obtained with the administration of contrast material shows multiple rim-enhancing cystic lesions in the submental subcutaneous tissue (Panel A, arrow). Fat stranding and swelling of the preseptal soft tissues of the left ocular globe (Panel B, arrow) are noted. The left sclera shows thickening and enhancement (arrowhead), which most likely indicate scleritis. Vancomycin, cefepime, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, and normal saline were administered intravenously, and folate, thiamine, and a multivitamin were given orally. On the second day, testing for rheumatoid factor and antibodies to double-stranded DNA, Ro, La, Sm, RNP, and treponema (syphilis) was negative, as was testing for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and antigen.

The patient had been well until approximately 3 months before the current admission, when intermittent dizziness, palpitations, near syncope, diaphoresis, polyuria, polydipsia, diarrhea, chest and abdominal pain, headaches, and increasing protuberance of the eyes developed. Eleven weeks before this admission, she was evaluated at school, at an emergency department of another hospital, and at her pediatrician\u2019s office. She had hypertension, with a blood pressure of up to 168/86 mm Hg, and tachycardia, with a pulse of up to 126 beats per minute. A complete blood count and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Screening of the blood for toxins, Lyme disease, and antibodies against thyroglobulin, microsomes, and thyroperoxidase was negative, as was a urine pregnancy test; other test results are shown inTable 1. A few days later, 10.5 weeks before this admission, she was seen in the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Laboratory Data. On evaluation, the patient reported no intolerance to heat or cold, tremor, or weight loss. She had had anemia as an infant and had undergone a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis at 14 years of age. Menarche occurred at 11 years of age. She took no medications, her immunizations were up to date, and she had no known allergies. She was born in the Dominican Republic and came to the United States at 6 years of age. She lived with her parents, maternal grandmother, and two sisters. She was enrolled in an individualized education program in high school. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had celiac disease, a paternal aunt had hypothyroidism, her paternal grandmother had vitiligo and had undergone a thyroidectomy, and her father and siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 110/72 mm Hg, and the pulse 114 beats per minute; the temperature and respiratory rate were normal. The height was 166.3 cm, the weight 81.1 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 29.3. Proptosis, a pronounced stare, and a tremor of the tongue with protrusion were present. The thyroid was enlarged (each lobe 4 cm in diameter), without palpable nodules or an audible thyroid bruit. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A thyroid scan, obtained 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 9.63 mCi of technetium-99m sodium pertechnetate, showed an enlarged thyroid gland with homogeneously increased tracer uptake (Figure 1A). Technetium-99m is taken up and concentrated by the sodium\u2013iodide symporter of the thyroid gland. In this case, the homogeneity and intensity of the uptake rule out toxic nodular goiter and subacute thyroiditis as causes of the hyperthyroidism. Thyroid uptake is calculated by a comparison of the level of technetium-99m activity in the thyroid lobes and the level in the injected dose, after correction for the camera calibration factor (Figure 1B). The total thyroid uptake of technetium-99m in this patient was 8.6% (4.5% in the right lobe, and 4.1% in the left lobe); the normal range is 0.5 to 1.7%. Both the gland enlargement and the homogeneously increased tracer uptake are consistent with a diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease. Thyroid Scan.A thyroid scan, obtained 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 9.63 mCi of technetium-99m sodium pertechnetate, shows an enlarged thyroid gland (Panel A) with homogeneously increased tracer uptake. The green and red ovals outline the regions of interest in the right and left lobes of the thyroid, respectively. The thyroid uptake is calculated by a comparison of the level of technetium-99m activity in the thyroid lobes and the level in the injected dose, after correction for the camera calibration factor. The parameters of tracer uptake (Panel B) obtained from the two regions of interest show that the total thyroid uptake of technetium-99m in this patient is 8.6% of the injected dose (4.5% in the right lobe, and 4.1% in the left lobe); the normal range is 0.5 to 1.7%. These findings are consistent with Graves\u2019 disease. The patient received a diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease, and treatment with atenolol (25 mg twice daily) and methimazole (30 mg daily) was begun. Three weeks later (7.5 weeks before this admission), on follow-up evaluation, the patient reported occasional headaches and dizziness, decreased palpitations and diaphoresis, and improved vision and sleep. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Follow-up with thyroid ablation was planned. During the following month, the patient\u2019s family noted increasing bulging of her eyes. Approximately 5 weeks before this admission, the patient reported increased distress regarding her physical appearance and a lack of friends. Two weeks later, she told her sister that voices were following her everywhere and that \u201cthe devil wants me.\u201d She cut herself with an earring and told her family that she did not feel safe. Three weeks before this admission, on evaluation in the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported awakening each morning around 3 a.m. Her energy and interest levels were low. She reported, \u201cI have wanted to kill myself for a while, but it has gotten worse. I\u2019m just done feeling fat and ugly. I just don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d She also felt tormented by voices that she thought were following her to school; the voices told her not to eat and gave her ideas about ways to kill herself, including \u201cgo into the kitchen and get knives.\u201d She had reportedly tried to leave her house in the middle of the night to stab herself. During the previous month, she had begun skipping meals and purging after eating because the internal voices were saying that food was bad. Her performance in school deteriorated. On examination, the blood pressure was 137/81 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute; the temperature and oxygen saturation were normal. There were superficial lacerations on her wrists and stomach. She was oriented to person, place, and time. She was tearful, sad, and anxious but cooperative. Her speech was normal, and she had ruminative thought processes regarding the voices she was hearing that were instructing her to kill herself. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of renal-function tests were normal, and screening for toxins and a urine pregnancy test were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of the other hospital. The dose of methimazole was increased to 40 mg daily, and treatment with olanzapine (5 mg at bedtime) and lorazepam (1 mg every 4 hours) was begun. She attended group sessions. In the hospital, anxiety decreased, quality of sleep improved, and auditory hallucinations and urges for self-injurious behavior resolved. On the sixth day, she was friendly, calm, and cooperative, with a euthymic mood and congruent affect. Her thought processes were linear and goal-directed, and she had no delusions, evidence of perceptual disturbances, or homicidal or suicidal ideation. She was discharged on the sixth day, after a follow-up appointment in the outpatient endocrinology clinic of this hospital had been scheduled. Medications included methimazole (40 mg daily), atenolol (25 mg twice daily), lorazepam (1 mg every 4 hours), and olanzapine (5 mg at bedtime). During the next week, outpatient evaluations in the endocrinology clinic and at the weight center of this hospital were performed. The height was 166 cm, the weight 85.6 kg, and the BMI 31.1. A complete blood count, lipid profile, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, vitamin B12, ferritin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, insulin, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, parathyroid hormone, testosterone, free testosterone, glycated hemoglobin, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown inTable 1. After discharge, the patient became hyper-religious; she impulsively changed churches and talked about \u201cgiving herself to God.\u201d Seven days after discharge (8 days before this admission), she ran away from home to meet a man she had met on a social media website. She was found the next day by police and returned to the other hospital. She reported feeling depressed and weak, with decreased energy but without suicidal ideation or hallucinations. She was readmitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of the other hospital; 1 week later, she was transferred to this hospital.", "true_dx": "Graves\u2019 disease with diffuse nodular papillary hyperplasia of the thyroid.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when fever developed, with a temperature of up to 39.9\u00b0C and associated shaking chills. He had a poor appetite and was eating and drinking less than usual. Three days before admission, he stopped using long-acting insulin for his diabetes because fasting blood glucose levels were less than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). One day before admission, a dry cough developed. On the morning of admission, the patient noticed shortness of breath. He called his primary care physician, who recommended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing shortness of breath, with no chest pain, orthopnea, or leg swelling. He had not traveled recently. He worked as a limousine driver but had not had known contact with anyone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. A drug-eluting stent had been placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery 7 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, ezetimibe, glipizide, insulin glargine, lisinopril, metformin, metoprolol, rosuvastatin, and testosterone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. He lived with his girlfriend in a suburb of Boston. His family history included coronary artery disease in his father and emphysema in his mother. On examination, the temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 157/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 37.1. The patient had moderately increased work of breathing and diffuse coarse crackles at the lung bases. The mucous membranes were dry. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood creatinine level of 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) was higher than the level obtained 1 year earlier (0.8 mg per deciliter [71 \u03bcmol per liter]).

A chest radiograph obtained in the emergency department showed bilateral multifocal patchy opacities, a finding suggestive of pneumonia (Figure 1A). Chest Radiographs.A chest radiograph obtained on admission (Panel A) shows bilateral multifocal patchy opacities, a finding suggestive of pneumonia. A chest radiograph obtained 1 day before continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated (Panel B) shows evidence of an increase in bilateral consolidation and interstitial opacities, a finding suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Also shown are an endotracheal tube in the trachea, a catheter in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube in place. Blood samples were obtained for culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, along with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Three hours after admission, the oxygen saturation decreased to 87% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 92% with the administration of oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Five hours later, shortness of breath increased and the oxygen saturation decreased, and the oxygen flow rate was adjusted to 6 liters per minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Intravenous vancomycin and furosemide were administered. The nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA returned positive. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started, and the patient was enrolled in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov number,NCT04280705). Sixteen hours after transfer to the ICU, the patient underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for persistent tachypnea and worsening oxygen saturation. During the next 24 hours, hypotension developed, with the blood pressure decreasing to 78/45 mm Hg, and treatment with intravenous norepinephrine was initiated. On hospital day 3, the creatinine level increased to 1.8 mg per deciliter (159 \u03bcmol per liter), and the patient\u2019s participation in the clinical trial of remdesivir was discontinued. During the next 5 days, his urine output was maintained at 100 ml per hour with the administration of increased doses of intravenous loop diuretics, but the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels continued to rise \u2014 reaching 111 mg per deciliter (39.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]) and 6.9 mg per deciliter (610 \u03bcmol per liter), respectively \u2014 and a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis developed.

His neck pain had developed at work. Examination of the neck had revealed trapezius muscle spasm; naproxen, acetaminophen, and cyclobenzaprine had been administered, and the pain partially decreased. He also had a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diverticulitis, lumbar disk disease, colonic polyps, ischial bursitis, chronic dyspepsia, nocturnal leg cramps, excessive alcohol use, and osteoarthritis of the shoulders, knees, and hips. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, calcium carbonate for dyspepsia, tamsulosin, n\u20133 fatty acids, glucosamine, and a multivitamin, as well as ibuprofen and naproxen for musculoskeletal symptoms and, as needed, tadalafil and disulfiram.

The blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Eight hours later, when the test results were known, the patient was advised to go to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation of potentially life-threatening abnormalities, and he was subsequently admitted. In the emergency department, the patient reported residual stiffness of the neck. He had had an influenza-like illness (with subjective fevers, diaphoresis, and nasal congestion) approximately 3 weeks before this evaluation that resolved spontaneously, and he reported chronic constipation that was unchanged. He had stopped drinking alcohol 4 years earlier and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived with his wife, had adult children, and worked in an office. His father and a grandfather had died of lung cancer, a grandmother had died of a stroke, his mother had died of liver disease, and an uncle had had pancreatic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 159/114 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of 101 beats per minute, a PR interval of 260 msec, a QRS complex of 136 msec, and a ratio of QT interval to QT interval corrected for heart rate of 318:412 msec; first-degree atrioventricular block and right bundle-branch block were present and had not been present 3 years earlier. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and degenerative changes of the spine. The platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, lactic acid, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, troponin T, andN-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with a pH of 9.0, a specific gravity of 1.006, and 1+ occult blood by dipstick, as well as 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field; squamous cells were present. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast material, revealed no evidence of cancer. CT of the chest revealed an indeterminate sclerotic lesion involving the right eighth rib (Figure 1). A radionuclide bone scan was recommended as a screening study for additional skeletal lesions. The bone scan revealed nonspecific abnormal uptake by the rib lesion and at the left ischium (Figure 2). Because there were concerns about cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was recommended for further evaluation and revealed a high-grade tear of the left common hamstring tendon at the ischial tuberosity attachment site. A fluoroscopically guided glucocorticoid injection had been performed at this location 11 months earlier. CT Scan of the Chest.A CT scan of the chest, obtained on hospital day 1, showed an indeterminate sclerotic lesion located at the anterolateral aspect of the right eighth rib (arrow). Radionuclide Bone Scan.A radionuclide bone scan, obtained on hospital day 2, showed abnormal uptake of the radiotracer by the rib lesion (not visible in this image). This nonspecific uptake could be explained by trauma or metastatic disease. On a posterior view of the pelvis, a second focus of abnormal uptake involved the left ischium (arrow).

Approximately 2 months before the current evaluation, the patient had a febrile seizure associated with an acute viral illness. After the seizure, his mother reported that his \u201cwaddling\u201d gait had become more pronounced. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic at another hospital. On examination, the cover-up test \u2014 in which the distal lower leg is covered and the alignment of the proximal lower leg is compared with that of the upper leg \u2014 was negative, a finding consistent with physiologic bowing of the leg. There was a pes planus (flatfoot) deformity that resolved when the patient was not bearing weight on the foot, and there was an external (positive) foot progression angle with ambulation. The mother was counseled that the findings were within the normal range for gait and musculoskeletal development. One day before the current evaluation, the mother noticed that the child\u2019s legs \u201clocked up\u201d and appeared \u201cshaky\u201d when he was walking over a threshold. On the morning of the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed that the child was grunting while sleeping, with his eyes rolled upward and his arms stiffened and flexed. After less than 1 minute, the grunting and movements stopped and the patient vomited. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. Vital signs, mental status, and findings on physical examination were reportedly normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a blood calcium level of 5.0 mg per deciliter (1.25 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter]). Intravenous calcium gluconate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving approximately 18 hours after a presumed seizure. Further history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. The patient had been delivered at full term and had reportedly met developmental milestones for his age. His medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis, which had been diagnosed when he was 9 weeks of age, as well as multiple environmental and food allergies. One year earlier, evaluation by an allergist had revealed elevated levels on IgE tests specific to food allergens (milk, cashews, pistachios, egg whites, almonds, soybeans, chickpeas, green peas, lentils, peanuts, and sesame seeds) and environmental allergens (dogs, cats, and dust mites), although the patient later underwent food challenges to peanuts, legumes, almonds, and sesame seeds in an allergy clinic and had no symptoms. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had received diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, epinephrine, and topical betamethasone as needed. He had not received any routine childhood vaccinations because of his parents\u2019 refusal. The patient lived with his mother, father, two older siblings, and dog in New England. Although the mother was a vegetarian, she occasionally included chicken in the patient\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d and organic diet. The patient\u2019s mother had obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and anxiety, and his father had oral allergy syndrome and a history of varus knee deformity in childhood. The patient\u2019s two siblings had atopic dermatitis, environmental allergies, and food allergies. There was no family history of seizure. On physical examination, the patient appeared well and was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the height 83.5 cm (3rd percentile for his age), and the weight 12.4 kg (24th percentile for his age). The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Muscle spasms occurred in the arms and legs with passive movement. Chvostek\u2019s sign (contraction of the facial muscles) was not elicited after tapping on the region of the facial nerve anterior to the external auditory canal; Trousseau\u2019s sign (carpal spasm) was not elicited after exertion of pressure from inflation of a sphygmomanometer on the upper arm. Muscle power, bulk, tone, and deep-tendon reflexes were normal, as was the remainder of the examination. The blood calcium level was 5.6 mg per deciliter (1.40 mmol per liter), the ionized calcium level 0.88 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.14 to 1.30), and the alkaline phosphatase level 673 U per liter (reference range, 142 to 335).

The patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered intravenously. Thoracostomy (placement of a chest tube for drainage) was performed, and pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Gram\u2019s staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admission, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Two weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy developed, along with new diffuse headache. The patient\u2019s family thought that she appeared somnolent and \u201cclumsy\u201d while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dyspnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 176/101 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypodensities. Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydralazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital. Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffusion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebellar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diameter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surrounding smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter. MRI of the Head.A diffusion-weighted imaging sequence shows foci of restricted diffusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Panel A) and the right frontal lobe (Panel B). Video electroencephalography revealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated. During the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were obtained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar puncture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazidime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital. On arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles because of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were then performed; histologic examination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications included torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies. Four decades before the current admission, the patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buying groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovascular, or renal disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow commands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmetric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the abdominal examination was normal. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma reagin test was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when fatigue, subjective fever, and chills developed. The next day, he began having headaches, nonbilious nonbloody emesis, diarrhea, decreased appetite, low back pain, and dysuria. On the day before admission, he was able to drink only one glass of water without vomiting. His mother brought him to the emergency department of this hospital. He reported dry mouth, eye pain when he was febrile, and light-headedness. He had a history of exercise-induced asthma and had been hospitalized during early childhood for diarrhea. He took no medications and had no known medication allergies. Immunizations were current. He lived with his mother, stepfather, and brother in an urban area of New England and attended high school. He was born in Central America, had moved to the United States at 15 years of age, and had not traveled outside the country since that time. The family had frequent visitors from Central America. The patient had had a negative interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis 2 months before this evaluation. He was sexually active with one female partner and reported consistent condom use. Two months earlier, tests for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia had been negative. He smoked one cigarette each day, used marijuana three times per week, and drank alcohol intermittently. He had a pet rabbit but no contact with other animals, no history of recent tick or mosquito bites, and no contact with sick persons. There was no family history of renal stones or autoimmune disorders. On examination, the patient appeared to be tired. The temperature was 39.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 125/67 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles of the low back were tender. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin; additional test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 2+ albumin and 1+ ketones by dipstick; there were few squamous cells and very few transitional cells per high-power field, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Cultures of blood and urine were negative, as were tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and urinary nucleic-acid tests forNeisseria gonorrhoeaeandChlamydia trachomatis. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ondansetron, and ibuprofen were administered. During the next 4 hours, the fever, tachycardia, and pain resolved, and the patient was able to drink water without vomiting. He was discharged home and advised to continue taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and ondansetron, as well as to rest, drink fluids, and follow up with his primary care physician in 2 days. Laboratory Data. The next morning, the patient awoke with severe pain in the abdomen, groin, and scrotum on the left side. Light-headedness, dysuria, diarrhea, and nausea persisted, and he vomited after each attempt to eat or drink. He returned to the emergency department, where he rated his pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He reported that 3 weeks earlier, he had had testicular trauma while attempting a stunt jump on his bicycle; the pain had resolved after approximately 30 minutes. On examination, he appeared to be uncomfortable, lying still on the stretcher. The temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/61 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness of the left costovertebral angle, the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, the left inguinal crease, and the superior aspect of the left testicle; there was no scrotal mass, edema, or discoloration. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal, and the level of C-reactive protein was 162.7 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Examination of the urine before and after prostatic massage revealed trace occult blood by dipstick in both samples, with otherwise normal results. Ultrasonography of the scrotum, kidneys, and bladder revealed an 8-mm cyst in the left epididymal head and no acute abnormalities. Ketorolac was administered. The patient\u2019s pain persisted, and the temperature rose to 38.9\u00b0C; acetaminophen was administered, and he was admitted to the hospital. On admission, the patient reported left scrotal pain and headache. His diarrhea had resolved. The temperature was 39.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/63 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. There was mild tenderness of the anterior and posterior left thigh; results of the physical examination were otherwise unchanged from the assessment in the emergency department. Intravenous fluids, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered. The patient\u2019s urine was strained after each void; no stones were found. On the second hospital day, vomiting resolved but fever persisted and pain of the abdomen and groin worsened; morphine was administered as needed. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material (Figure 1A), revealed an ill-defined low-density material that tracked along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and aorta and into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the right. Low-density material was also seen in the left paracolic gutter. The radiologic differential diagnosis included infectious and inflammatory causes with a possible pelvic, leg, or genitourinary source or traumatic injury to the bladder or ureter. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and other visualized structures in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower thorax were normal. Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis.A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel A) shows an ill-defined low-density material that tracks along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and into the left paracolic gutter. A contrast-enhanced MRI scan (Panel B) shows several prominent inguinal lymph nodes, some with central necrosis. On the third hospital day, the patient continued to receive morphine for pain and acetaminophen for fever. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed two enlarged left external iliac lymph nodes (0.8 cm and 0.7 cm in short-axis diameter) and a heterogeneous, ill-defined, mixed echogenic collection located to the left of the bladder, a finding suggestive of loculated fluid or phlegmon. A chest radiograph was normal. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed normochromic normocytic red cells, occasional symmetrical spindle-shaped red cells with smooth contours, very few burr cells, very few teardrop-shaped red cells, normal lymphocytes and monocytes, and normal platelets with occasional large forms. Results of renal-function tests and of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, as were red-cell indexes and blood levels of amylase, lipase, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Tests for heterophile antibodies and IgM and IgG antibodies toEhrlichia chaffeensis,Anaplasma phagocytophilum, andRickettsia rickettsiiwere negative, as was a polymerase-chain-reaction assay forA. phagocytophilumDNA; results of tests for antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were suggestive of past infection. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and gentamicin were administered. On the fourth hospital day, the patient\u2019s pain decreased and his fever resolved.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 4 weeks before this admission, when he was on vacation in the Caribbean and his wife noted that he was unresponsive, \u201cgurgling,\u201d and diaphoretic in the early morning. When he awoke, he reported chest pain, palpitations, and light-headedness. The patient was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where the heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/56 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The troponin T level was 1.56 ng per milliliter (normal range, <0.01), and the lactate level was 1.9 mmol per liter (17 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 1.6 mmol per liter [5 to 14 mg per deciliter]). A complete blood count and levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, and amylase were normal, as were results of tests of renal and thyroid function; ad-dimer level was undetectable. While the patient was in the local hospital, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia developed at a heart rate of 201 beats per minute; electrocardioversion resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm. Aspirin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, rosuvastatin, amiodarone, and tirofiban were administered. The patient was transferred by air to a hospital in Florida. On examination at the second hospital, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 57 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood troponin I level was 116.00 ng per milliliter (normal range, \u22640.05). A complete blood count, results of renal-function tests, levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin, and the prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) showed sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and delayed intraventricular conduction. Aspirin, amiodarone, enoxaparin, and atorvastatin were administered. Ventricular tachycardia recurred at a heart rate of 176 beats per minute. Despite the administration of an intravenous bolus of amiodarone, ventricular tachycardia persisted. Electrocardioversion restored sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and cardiac studies were performed. Initial Cardiac Studies, Obtained at the Second Hospital.Cardiac studies were obtained during the patient\u2019s initial hospitalization in Florida. An electrocardiogram (Panel A) shows sinus bradycardia, a ventricular ectopic beat, borderline first-degree atrioventricular delay, delayed intraventricular conduction, and a normal frontal-plane QRS axis. A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained in a parasternal long-axis view (Panel B) shows mildly increased thickness of the interventricular septum (measuring 13 mm) and a mildly dilated left ventricle (measuring 60 mm at end diastole). Cardiac MRI was also performed. A fat-suppressed, T2-weighted image obtained in a short-axis view (Panel C) shows a hyperintense septum (arrows), a finding consistent with myocardial edema. An image with late gadolinium enhancement, obtained in a short-axis view (Panel D), shows patchy enhancement in the septum at the subepicardial location, with extension into the subendocardial layer of the midanterior segment; subepicardial gadolinium enhancement is also seen in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (arrows). An image with late gadolinium enhancement, obtained in a four-chamber view (Panel E), shows nodular foci in the midwall of the septum, as well as subepicardial gadolinium enhancement in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (arrows). Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. On ventriculography, the left ventricle was mildly and diffusely hypokinetic, and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg (normal range, 8 to 15). Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 1B) revealed a dilated left ventricle with an end-diastolic dimension of 60 mm (normal range, 42 to 58) and an ejection fraction of 35% (normal range, 55 to 70); there was diffuse hypokinesis that was most notable in the inferior and septal territories, mildly increased wall thickness, and mild mitral regurgitation (seeVideo 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the septal hypokinesis and revealed moderate left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 43%, as well as mild right ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 36% (seeVideos 2 and 3, available at NEJM.org). The left ventricular myocardium was normal in thickness. T2-weighted images (Figure 1C) showed marked myocardial edema that was most prominent in the interventricular septum. The ratio of signal in the myocardium to signal in the skeletal muscle was elevated, at 2.4 (normal range, \u22641.9), a finding compatible with edema. Images with late gadolinium enhancement (Figure 1D and 1E) showed patchy, nodular foci in the midwall and subepicardium of the septum and in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle, with minimal extension into the subendocardium of the anterior segment at the midventricular level. The myocardial edema and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement fulfilled the Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.1,2 Additional laboratory test results included negative nucleic acid amplification tests of the blood for DNA of adenovirus,Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, andMycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as negative nucleic acid amplification tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for DNA ofBordetella pertussis, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. In addition, serologic testing was negative for antibodies to coxsackievirus, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, Lyme disease, andTrypanosoma cruzi, as well as for IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus viral capsid antigen, and parvovirus. Aspirin, metoprolol succinate, and amiodarone were prescribed, and the patient was discharged with a wearable defibrillator vest after a follow-up visit had been scheduled at this hospital. Ten days before this admission, the patient had consultations at this hospital with a cardiologist specializing in the management of heart failure and an electrophysiologist. Vital signs were notable for a heart rate of 49 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 108/70 mm Hg; the examination was otherwise normal. An electrocardiogram (Figure 2A) showed sinus bradycardia and first-degree atrioventricular delay, as well as right bundle-branch block and a left anterior fascicular block (which together constitute bifascicular block). Aspirin was stopped, spironolactone was added, and placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was scheduled. Subsequent Cardiac Studies, Obtained at This Hospital.An electrocardiogram obtained during the patient\u2019s visit to an outpatient clinic at this hospital, 10 days before admission (Panel A), shows sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular delay, and progression to right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block (which together constitute bifascicular block). A follow-up electrocardiogram obtained shortly after implantation of the implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) at this hospital (Panel B) shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with an extremely wide QRS complex. A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained in a parasternal long-axis view shortly after the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit of this hospital (Panel C) shows thinning of the interventricular septum (arrow), which had decreased in thickness from 13 mm to 7 mm during the 4-week period since the initial echocardiogram had been obtained. On the morning of this admission, during placement of a dual-chamber ICD, episodes of ventricular tachycardia with varying foci were induced. These episodes were terminated with overdrive pacing. After the procedure, ventricular tachycardia developed, with a heart rate of 108 beats per minute (Figure 2B). The blood pressure was 88/53 mm Hg, and a lidocaine infusion was administered. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. During the next 10 hours, multiple additional episodes of monomorphic ventricular rhythms occurred, with the heart rate ranging from 90 to 140 beats per minute. The rate of lidocaine infusion was increased, and amiodarone was administered. Early in the morning of the second hospital day, ventricular tachycardia recurred, with associated dyspnea and a blood pressure of 66/40 mm Hg. Normal saline and norepinephrine were administered intravenously. Chest radiography revealed ICD leads in the appropriate position, and bedside echocardiography revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion. The ventricular tachycardia was terminated with antitachycardic pacing, and the ICD was reprogrammed to provide atrial pacing at a rate of 110 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient had been in good health until 2 weeks before admission, when fatigue developed. Eleven days before presentation, he had moved to the United States from Indonesia. After his arrival, he had bloating and nonbloody, loose bowel movements, without fever, chills, vomiting, cramping, or abdominal pain. One week later, the diarrhea persisted and his exercise tolerance sharply decreased. The day before admission, he was seen at his local health center. Testing included a complete blood count (Table 1) and stool examination. He was referred to this hospital for admission. Laboratory Data. The patient reported weight loss of approximately 4.5 kg in recent weeks, without dyspnea, night sweats, fevers, chills, rash, arthritis, cough, pruritus, alcohol intolerance, or hypersensitivity to insect bites. Two years earlier, the patient had presented with intermittent diarrhea, abdominal cramping, tenesmus, nausea, and weight loss (9 kg); there had been microscopic blood in the stool, and a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis had been confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy. Symptoms had responded to treatment with mesalamine. Complete blood counts at the time of the diagnosis and 7 months before this admission had been normal. On his admission to this hospital, the patient's medications included mesalamine (1.2 g daily) and acetaminophen as needed for headache. He had no known allergies. He was born in India and had lived in Indonesia and Australia during the previous 25 years. He had traveled to a rural area in India in the previous month. He was married, reported being monogamous with his wife, and had no children. He had moved to the United States to attend graduate school. He was a vegetarian, drank alcohol infrequently, had a remote history of light smoking, and did not use illicit drugs. His parents and brother were healthy. There was no family history of cancer or autoimmune disease. On examination of the patient, the vital signs were normal. The spleen tip was palpable, and an erythematous papular rash was seen on the anterior thorax; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of creatinine, magnesium, total and direct bilirubin, amylase, lipase, uric acid, fibrinogen, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, and tryptase were normal, as were the activated partial-thromboplastin time and results of D-dimer testing; testing for total antibodies to hepatitis A virus was positive; and testing for hepatitis A virus IgM, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis B virus surface antibodies was negative. Other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, as large as 1.4 cm by 2.2 cm by 3.1 cm. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of contrast material, was normal. Four days later, positron-emission tomography with the use of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) revealed intense uptake of FDG throughout the skeleton and in an enlarged spleen, with low-to-moderate uptake in retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. A CT-guided core biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was performed, and the specimen showed reactive hyperplasia with increased eosinophils and plasma cells but no evidence of lymphoma on morphologic studies or flow cytometry. Stool specimens were negative forClostridium difficiletoxin, protozoa, helminth ova, and enteric pathogens.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 year before this evaluation, when nasal congestion and headache developed. During the next 3 months, his symptoms worsened. Nine months before this evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head without the administration of contrast material was performed at another hospital (Figure 1A). The imaging studies revealed diffuse mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus, with inspissated secretions filling that sinus, and scattered mild mucosal thickening within the left sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. MRI Scans Obtained over a 9-Month Period.Sagittal T1-weighted images obtained before the administration of contrast material show the evolution of MRI abnormalities in the pituitary gland, infundibular stalk, and sphenoid sinus. The images shown are from 9 months before (Panel A), 7 months before (Panel B), 3 months before (Panel C), and during (Panel D) the initial evaluation at this hospital. Yellow and blue arrows indicate the changes in the sphenoid sinus and pituitary gland, respectively. The patient was treated with a course of antibiotics, but there was no improvement. One month later, endoscopic sinus surgery with maxillary antrostomy and septoplasty was performed at a second hospital. Two weeks after surgery (approximately 7.5 months before this evaluation), diplopia developed that worsened on lateral gaze; there was no ocular pain, proptosis, facial numbness, or swelling. On examination by a neuro-ophthalmologist, mild deficits on abduction that involved both eyes, with the right deficit more severe than the left, and a large-angle esotropia were noted. A diagnosis of a right sixth-nerve palsy was made. Seven months before this evaluation, MRI of the head with the administration of gadolinium was performed (Figure 1B). The imaging studies revealed changes consistent with persistent inflammation of the sphenoid sinuses and diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland, which measured 17 mm in the maximal transverse dimension and 9 mm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension. Methylprednisolone and antibiotics were administered for 3 weeks, and the diplopia resolved 6 weeks after onset. Mild to moderately severe headaches, worse in the evenings, persisted. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, polydipsia and polyuria developed. Urine volume measured up to 6 liters daily, and the specific gravity was less than 1.005. The level of plasma antidiuretic hormone was reportedly undetectable during a water-deprivation test. The urine osmolality did not increase in response to water deprivation but increased by 150% after the administration of desmopressin. Treatment with nasally administered desmopressin was begun and resulted in a decrease in urinary frequency, nocturia, and thirst. Three months before this evaluation, repeat MRI of the head, performed with the administration of gadolinium (Figure 1C), revealed extensive mucosal thickening and partial filling of the right sphenoid sinus with secretions, with enlargement of the pituitary gland to 19 mm by 11 mm by 13 mm (maximal transverse, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior dimensions, respectively), as compared with 16 mm by 7 mm by 11 mm 7 months earlier and 17 mm by 9 mm by 12 mm 5 months earlier. The pituitary gland showed homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium administration and had an abnormal superior convexity. The infundibular stalk also appeared to be mildly thickened. Eight days after the repeat MRI was performed, diplopia recurred. Approximately 6 weeks before this evaluation, neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed minor bilateral abduction deficits. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 4 white cells per cubic millimeter (97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes), a protein level of 66 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), and normal levels of glucose, alpha-fetoprotein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. The patient was prescribed a 3-week course of levofloxacin and referred to this hospital. Laboratory Data. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nocturia and mild headache; his diplopia had resolved within the previous month. He had been physically active and had run 12 miles weekly until 3 months before this evaluation, when leg fatigue developed. He shaved daily and reported a weight gain of 3 to 4 kg (6 to 8 lb), mild muscle soreness, and extreme sensitivity to cold. His shoe size had increased by half a size over a period of several years. He had no unexplained sweating, arthralgias, nausea, constipation, dizziness, faintness, breast tenderness, edema, bruising, rash, erectile dysfunction, low libido, or history of colon polyps. He had had hepatitis A virus infection and had undergone knee arthroscopy in the remote past. He had undergone herniorrhaphy as an infant. Medications included desmopressin nasal spray (administered twice daily), levofloxacin, and, as needed, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine. He had no known allergies. He was married, lived in a midwestern state, and worked in sales. He did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. His father had died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and his mother from lung cancer; his mother had also had hypothyroidism. On examination, the vital signs were normal, as was the otolaryngologic examination. The frontal and maxillary sinuses were not tender, and nasal endoscopy revealed normal mucosa; there was no evidence of mucopurulent discharge, and the lacrimal and salivary glands were normal. There was no proptosis or ocular inflammation. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination, including examination of the cranial nerves, was normal. The white-cell count, white-cell differential count, and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, globulin, total protein, glucose, calculated mean blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, calcium, and prostate-specific antigen. Results of liver-function and renal-function tests were normal, as was the urinalysis; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph were normal. MRI of the pituitary, performed both without and with the administration of gadolinium (Figure 1DandFigure 2B and 2E), revealed diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland and the infundibular stalk, preservation of the sellar floor, and extensive mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus. On T2-weighted images, circumferential hypointense and enhancing soft tissue was again noted, partially filling the right sphenoid sinus; the size of the soft tissue was larger than its size on the first MRI but was stable when compared with the finding on the imaging study performed 7 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the face and sinuses showed expansion of the pituitary fossa and thickening and sclerosis of the adjacent sphenoid sinus walls, findings that suggested chronic inflammatory changes (Figure 2A and 2D). Pretreatment and Post-Treatment Imaging Studies.Nonenhanced coronal (Panel A) and sagittal (Panel B) computed tomographic (CT) images obtained before treatment was started show layering secretions within the sphenoid sinus and sclerotic changes of the sinus walls, findings that are suggestive of changes due to chronic inflammation. The contrast-enhanced coronal (Panel C) and sagittal (Panel D) T1-weighted MRI images obtained before treatment show abnormal thickening of the infundibular stalk (red arrows) and mild enlargement of the pituitary gland.

The patient had been well until approximately 1 month before the current presentation, when a pruritic rash developed below the waist, most prominently on the left upper thigh. The rash was similar to transient rashes he had had in the past. Ten days before this presentation, he was seen in the urgent care clinic at this hospital for evaluation. On examination, there were pigment changes on the face and lower abdomen, scattered small papules involving the lower legs and wrists, purpura on the left thigh, and multiple scattered excoriations. A diagnosis of dermatitis was made, and he was referred to the dermatology clinic. On evaluation at the dermatology clinic the next day, he reported severe itching, including on his ears. He had not used any new soaps or detergents. On examination, there were geometric erythematous-to-violaceous patches and plaques, most notably on the abdomen under the belt buckle and on both legs in the location of the pants pockets, with depigmentation and prurigo nodules, and there was a low density of brown papules (2 to 4 mm in diameter) over the trunk and limbs that were consistent with benign nevi. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of severe contact dermatitis was made and was thought to be caused by coins or nickel on his clothing. A tapered course of prednisone was administered. Nine days later, at 4 p.m. on the day of admission, a headache developed in the patient that was unlike any pain he had had previously and that was associated with increasing agitation and restlessness. He self-administered ibuprofen, without improvement. He was brought to the emergency department at this hospital by his family. The history was obtained from the patient and his relatives. He rated his pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). He reported photophobia and nausea, with no fever, neck stiffness, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, head trauma, or chest or abdominal pain. He had melasma and acne; he had had hidradenitis suppurativa and, during the previous 8 years, recurrent pruritic rashes predominantly around the waist and axillae that were associated with transient eosinophilia (910 cells per cubic millimeter [16%]; reference range, 100 to 300). Four years earlier, the patient had had a partial small-bowel obstruction and underwent resection of a Meckel's diverticulum. Medications included prednisone and hydroxyzine hydrochloride, as needed for itching. He had no known allergies to medications. Vaccination history was not known. He was born in the Dominican Republic, had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier, lived with his wife and children, and worked indoors in a service capacity. He spoke Spanish as his primary language. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. He had visited the Dominican Republic 2 months before these symptoms occurred. On examination, the patient was oriented to person, place, and time and was agitated and tearful, holding his head, and moaning. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C to 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and briskly reactive to light. The neck was stiff, with pain on flexion and rotation. Strength was 4/5 bilaterally, the gait was unsteady, and he was unable to stand without assistance. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and results of liver- and renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, and calcium; other test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. A chest radiograph was normal. Blood specimens were cultured. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. Laboratory Data. Lumbar puncture was performed. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown inTable 1. Gram's staining of the CSF revealed abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes and very few gram-positive cocci in pairs. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, magnesium, and metoclopramide were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Rifampin, ondansetron, dexamethasone, and a narcotic analgesic agent were added, and acyclovir was stopped.

Approximately 4 months before presentation, the patient was admitted to a hospital in her home state for \u201cpounding\u201d in her chest, nausea, and diaphoresis that persisted for 40 minutes after a routine jog. The heart rate was 65 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 138/72 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was normal. Four serial electrocardiograms were reportedly normal, but the troponin I level was elevated, at 0.055 ng per milliliter, and 11 hours later, it had risen to 0.415 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal biventricular function. Coronary angiography revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mm Hg. After discharge (4 days after admission), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed normal biventricular function and size, with no evidence of myocardial edema or fibrosis. Aspirin and a beta blocker were prescribed for presumed exercise-related supraventricular tachycardia. The symptoms did not recur, and the patient returned to jogging and stopped taking the beta blocker. On the day before her transfer to this hospital, she was on a downhill-skiing trip in Vermont. In the morning, she felt fatigued. In the afternoon, palpitations, dyspnea, and weakness developed while she was at the top of a mountain; the ski patrol took her down the mountain, and the symptoms abated. In the evening, while she was at dinner, she had acute nausea and emesis followed by chest pain and dyspnea. She was taken to a local emergency department. The heart rate was 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 115/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air. Auscultation revealed diffuse crackles in the lungs. The troponin I level was 11.000 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 0.045), the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level 15,159 pg per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 125), the lactate level 4.6 mmol per liter (41.0 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deciliter]), the venous blood pH 7.22 (normal range, 7.38 to 7.46), and the white-cell count 36,100 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000). Bedside cardiac ultrasonography revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning. Intravenous infusions of heparin and furosemide were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to a nearby tertiary care center for treatment of suspected cardiogenic shock. On the patient\u2019s arrival at the tertiary care center, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 143 beats per minute, the blood pressure 96/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 84% while she was breathing ambient air and 88 to 94% while she was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask. On physical examination, she appeared fatigued and had jugular venous distention, diffuse crackles in the lungs, and cold arms and legs. The troponin I level was 4.790 ng per milliliter (normal range, <0.034), the white-cell count 30,240 per cubic millimeter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000), the arterial blood pH 7.08 (normal range, 7.35 to 7.45), the lactate level 5.9 mmol per liter (53 mg per deciliter; normal range, <2.0 mmol per liter [<18 mg per deciliter]), the NT-proBNP level 24,900 pg per milliliter (normal range, <300), and the creatinine level 1.41 mg per deciliter (125 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range for women, 0.52 to 1.04 mg per deciliter [46 to 92 \u03bcmol per liter]). Chest radiography revealed diffuse pulmonary edema. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and T-wave inversions in leads V4through V6. The trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated for respiratory failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 15% and left ventricular apical akinesis, as well as severe right ventricular apical dysfunction. Infusions of norepinephrine, dobutamine, epinephrine, amiodarone, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. Empirical methylprednisolone was administered for presumed myocarditis. Coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries; the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 38 mm Hg. A percutaneous transaortic left ventricular assist device was placed. After the institution of mechanical circulatory support, the intravenous doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were tapered and eventually stopped. Hematuria developed, and the urine output declined. The blood pressure was labile, ranging from 60/40 to 140/110 mm Hg, and an infusion of sodium nitroprusside was administered for control of elevated blood pressure. The patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital. On the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from her husband. She had a history of thyroid cancer (unknown pathologic subtype) that had been treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation. Medications included levothyroxine and a calcium supplement. The use of cefadroxil had caused the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was employed in health care, was married, and had one healthy daughter. Her maternal grandfather had died from myocardial infarction at 60 years of age, her father had had an aortic-valve replacement, and her mother had had lung cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 105/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure, 12; tidal volume, 400 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen, 1.0; respiratory rate, 16 breaths per minute). The pupils were reactive to light in a symmetric but slightly sluggish manner. The patient was able to follow simple commands. She had no masses in the neck or exophthalmos. The jugular veins appeared distended. Auscultation of the chest revealed the hum of the ventricular assist device, distant tachycardic heart sounds, and scattered crackles in the lungs. The ventricular assist device had been secured in place by way of the left groin. She had 1+ pedal edema bilaterally and no rash or lymphadenopathy. A small amount of reddish brown urine was noted. Levels of thyrotropin, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood. Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for nucleic acids of influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus and for metapneumovirus antigens were negative, as was combination testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 and p24 antigen.

The patient had been in her usual health until 4 months before this admission, when hypoesthesia developed in the lateral aspect of the left foot. During the following 2 days, the hypoesthesia spread to involve the toes and midfoot. On evaluation by her primary care physician, the patient reported that her chronic low-back pain, which radiated to the buttocks, had increased in intensity, but there was no pain in the legs, fever, weight loss, or bowel or bladder changes. On neurologic examination, perception of light touch and pinprick was absent on the left toes and left forefoot; the remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood levels of vitamin B12, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin were normal. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. During the next 5 days, hypoesthesia progressed to involve the proximal portion of the left foot, as well as the ankle and the lateral lower leg. The patient was evaluated in the outpatient neurology clinic, where she reported gradual progression of hypoesthesia involving the left leg but no pain or bowel or bladder incontinence. She was alert, cooperative, and articulate; she appeared well and was afebrile. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal (although the first cranial nerve was not tested). Strength was 4+ out of 5 during flexion and extension of the toes on the left foot, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the left ankle, eversion and inversion of the left foot, and flexion of the left knee; otherwise, strength was 5 out of 5. Perception of vibration was markedly diminished at the left hallux. Perception of light touch and pinprick was decreased on the left foot and the left lateral leg. Deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. The plantar reflex was flexor on the right side and absent on the left side. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was referred for nerve-conduction studies. Seven days later (3 months before this admission), nerve-conduction studies were performed. The sensory and motor responses were normal and symmetric, and F-wave minimal latencies in the tibial nerves were normal. Hoffman\u2019s reflex (or H reflex, which is the electrophysiological correlate of the Achilles\u2019 deep-tendon reflex) was absent at the left soleus and normal at the right soleus. Needle electromyography of the left leg showed diminished recruitment of long-duration, polyphasic motor-unit potentials in proximal and distal muscles of the L5 myotome. Results of electromyography of the right leg were normal. On the basis of these findings, imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed disk protrusions, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum, and facet arthropathy, processes that resulted in neural foraminal narrowing that was moderate on the left side at the level of L4\u2013L5 and moderate to severe on both sides at the level of L5\u2013S1. Nerve roots between the L3 and S1 levels had a thickened and clumped appearance and showed enhancement on contrast-enhanced images (Figure 1). Distal to the dorsal-root ganglia, the peripheral nerves were symmetric and did not show enhancement. MRI of the Lumbar Spine, Obtained 3 Months before Admission.Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, fat-saturated images (Panels A and B, respectively) show clumped, thickened, and enhancing cauda equina nerve roots in the lumbar spinal canal (arrows). A lumbar puncture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Oligoclonal banding was not present in concentrated CSF. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed increased lymphocytes that were polymorphous and occasionally reactive and appeared to be benign. Immunophenotypic evaluation of the CSF did not reveal evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population; other test results are shown inTable 1. A provisional diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was made, and intravenous immune globulin was administered 4 weeks and 1 week before the patient was admitted to this hospital. Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis. Despite the administration of intravenous immune globulin, symptoms in the left leg did not improve, and hypoesthesia and weakness developed in the right leg and progressed centripetally. The patient had several falls at home and began to use a cane, then a walker, and ultimately a wheelchair. When the patient was no longer able to stand from a seated position, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported episodes of bowel and bladder incontinence that she attributed to leg weakness interfering with her ability to walk to the bathroom quickly. She reported no fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Rheumatoid arthritis had been diagnosed 18 months before this admission, and therapy with methotrexate and prednisone had been initiated. Because of persistent disease activity, therapy with etanercept was initiated 7 months before this admission, after an interferon-\u03b3 release assay forMycobacterium tuberculosishad been negative. On serial computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, there were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in the bilateral lower lobes that had remained unchanged over a period of 4 years. The patient also had gastroesophageal reflux disease, uterine fibroids, and \u03b2-thalassemia minor. Results of routine screening mammography performed 1 month before this admission were normal. Medications were omeprazole, methotrexate, prednisone, folic acid, gabapentin, and duloxetine. The patient had recently stopped taking etanercept, because she thought her progressive symptoms could be related to that medication. She resided in New England and worked in a health care environment in a nonclinical role. She had previously traveled to the southwestern United States. She was a current smoker with an 18-pack-year history of smoking, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her sister had multiple sclerosis; there was no family history of cancer. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 168/78 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Motor strength was 4 out of 5 in both legs and 4+ out of 5 on both sides during hip flexion; the remainder of the motor examination was normal. Perception of vibration and temperature was markedly diminished in both legs from the toes to above the knees. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ and symmetric at the patellae and were absent at the soleus. The plantar reflex was absent on both sides. The patient was unable to stand without assistance. Two firm, nontender subcutaneous nodules (approximately 1 cm in diameter) with overlying excoriations were present in the left submandibular area. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, C-reactive protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. With the exception of the presence of a stable microcytic anemia, the complete blood count and white-cell differential count were normal. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies, andTreponema pallidumwere negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. MRI of the spine was performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 2A and 2B). Contrast-enhanced images showed diffuse, irregular, abnormal hyperintensity in the spinal cord that extended from T10 inferiorly to the conus; there was probable mild expansion of the spinal cord, diffuse abnormal signal throughout the spinal canal, marked thickening and enhancement of the nerve roots, and severe mass effect on the conus. MRI of the head was also performed with and without the administration of contrast material (Figure 2C and 2D). Contrast-enhanced images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed abnormal diffuse hyperintensity in the sulci of both hemispheres with no leptomeningeal enhancement; there were periventricular patchy, ill-defined foci of enhancement on both sides. CT of the chest revealed no clinically significant change in the previously identified pulmonary nodules and no lymphadenopathy. MRI of the Lumbar Spine and Head, Obtained on Admission.Sagittal and axial contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, fat-saturated images of the lumbar spine (Panels A and B, respectively) show gradual progression of the clumping, thickening, and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots (arrows), along with complete obliteration of the thecal sac and mass effect on the lower thoracic spinal cord and conus (Panel A, arrowhead). An axial, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image of the head obtained at the level of the frontoparietal convexities (Panel C) shows hyperintensity in the cerebral sulci (arrow). An axial contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted image of the head (Panel D) shows patchy, ill-defined enhancement in the periventricular white matter along the lateral ventricles (arrow) that is greater on the right side than on the left. Repeat nerve-conduction studies revealed asymmetric attenuation in the amplitudes of sensory and motor responses (which was worse on the left side than on the right) and no evidence of primary demyelination. Electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous activity in the bilateral thoracic paraspinal muscles at the level of T8 and in the bilateral gluteus maximus, tensor fasciae latae, lateral gastrocnemius, and right tibialis anterior muscles.

Approximately 7 years before this admission, the patient received a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis at another hospital, and she began taking prednisone. During the next 6 years, splenomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, and lethargy occurred, as did recurrent episodes of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and encephalopathy. A diagnosis of portal hypertension was made, and approximately 6 months before this admission, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure was performed at another hospital. Approximately 3.5 months before this admission, the patient moved to Massachusetts. The following week, she was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of intermittent headaches, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, and increasing abdominal and ankle swelling. She also had a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Her medications included prednisone, lactulose, omeprazole, rifaximin, neomycin, ursodiol, lisinopril, folate, potassium chloride, and insulin. On examination, the patient's vital signs were normal. Conjunctival injection and icterus, subconjunctival hemorrhages, and 2+ pedal edema were present bilaterally, and the abdomen was soft, without tenderness or guarding; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of urea nitrogen, globulin, magnesium, amylase, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Ultrasonography of the abdomen with noninvasive Doppler evaluation of the abdominal vasculature revealed splenomegaly, 19 cm in maximal diameter (normal range, <14 cm), and patency of the TIPS. The patient was advised to continue her medications at home, and referrals to a primary care physician and a hepatologist were made. Laboratory Data. Nine days later, the patient was found unresponsive on the floor at home. On examination by emergency medical services personnel, the capillary blood glucose level ranged from 30 to 39 mg per deciliter (1.7 to 2.2 mmol per liter); a glucose infusion was administered, and her condition improved. She was admitted to this hospital. Her physical and laboratory evaluations and imaging studies had not changed from previous examinations. She was discharged home on the second day. During the next month, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, with a speckled pattern, and tests for antibodies to smooth muscle and viral hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Eight weeks before the current admission, she was readmitted to this hospital because of increasing fatigue and confusion of 1 week's duration; she reportedly had stopped taking many of her medications. On examination, she was oriented only to self. The vital signs were normal, the skin jaundiced, the conjunctivae hyperemic, and the abdomen distended and soft, without tenderness. There was 1+ peripheral edema, and the remainder of the general and neurologic examination, except mental status, was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The glycated hemoglobin level was normal, testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 was negative, and the result of a test for Epstein\u2013Barr virus suggested past infection; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ glucose (>1000 mg per deciliter) and 1+ bilirubin, with 20 to 50 white cells, 3 to 5 red cells, few bacteria and squamous cells, and very few transitional cells per high-power field; calcium oxalate and mucin were present. Abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal a substantial amount of ascites. The patient's medications were readministered and her mental status improved. A urine culture grew moderate mixed bacteria, and ciprofloxacin was administered for 3 days. The patient was discharged on the fourth day. On follow-up examination on an outpatient basis, increasing peripheral edema was treated with spironolactone and a short course of furosemide, and the condition improved. Insulin was administered on a sliding scale for glucose levels that were as high as 512 mg per deciliter (28.4 mmol per liter). The thyrotropin level was 6.17 \u03bcU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00), and the level of free thyroxine (T4) was normal. Five days before the current admission, the patient returned to this hospital because of confusion, increasing lethargy, nonradiating midabdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal ultrasound examination was performed to assess the patency of the TIPS. Transverse images, obtained with and without the use of color-flow Doppler techniques, showed a patent TIPS, with normal velocities and hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein. Splenomegaly was also noted, with the spleen measuring 19.5 cm in maximal diameter. Furosemide was administered intravenously and then orally, and other medications were continued, with symptomatic improvement. Hepatology consultants calculated a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 20 (on a scale of 6 to 40, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), and an outpatient evaluation for liver transplantation was recommended. The blood level of IgA was 561 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309); blood levels of IgG and IgM were normal, with a normal pattern and without a detectable M component, and a follow-up measurement of blood levels of lactic acid was also normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver performed after the intravenous administration of gadolinium revealed marked morphologic features of nodular cirrhosis and signs of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly (19 cm in maximal diameter), upper abdominal varices, and a small amount of ascites. The main portal vein appeared patent, with proper positioning of the TIPS (Figure 1). Abdominal MRI Image.A coronal image from a T2-weighted sequence shows hepatic morphologic features of cirrhosis as well as splenomegaly and a small amount of upper abdominal ascites. The patient was discharged on the fourth day, with the plan that a visiting nurse would follow up. The next day, the patient's anorexia and leg edema were exacerbated, and her oral intake decreased. Constant, ill-defined midabdominal pain occurred, without fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria, hematochezia, melena, chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or syncope. She returned to this hospital the following day. The patient's medications included prednisone, lactulose, rifaximin, furosemide, spironolactone, glimepiride, insulin, neomycin, potassium chloride, folic acid, lisinopril, ursodiol, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and omeprazole. She was allergic to intravenous contrast material, which caused angioedema. She was born in Central America, spoke only Spanish, and immigrated to the United States more than 25 years previously. She did not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There was no family history of liver or other gastrointestinal disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or cardiac disease. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient had a depressed affect. There were bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhages and diffuse jaundice. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and epigastric and mild lower abdominal tenderness during deep palpation and without distention, hepatomegaly, or a palpable spleen. There was no evidence of asterixis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. An ECG was unchanged, as compared with the ECG obtained 8 weeks before this admission. The patient was admitted to this hospital. Outpatient medications were continued; ceftriaxone and metronidazole were administered intravenously, and nutritional supplements were provided. On the second day, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen performed after the oral administration of contrast material revealed cirrhosis with splenomegaly (span, 16.2 cm) and a TIPS in the proper position. In addition, diffuse wall thickening within the cecum and ascending colon, pericolonic fat stranding, and surrounding subcentimeter lymph nodes were present (Figure 2). The differential diagnosis for these findings includes ischemic, infectious, and inflammatory causes, although the right-sidedness is suggestive of neutropenic colitis. Abdominal CT Scan.On the second day, an abdominal CT scan was obtained after the oral administration of contrast material. An axial image through the lower abdomen shows cecal-wall thickening, with surrounding fat stranding and small lymph nodes. Hypotension, to 75/45 mm Hg, developed 2.5 hours after CT was performed. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Normal saline was infused, albumin and 4 units of red cells were transfused, and antihypertensive agents and diuretics were stopped; there was gradual improvement in blood pressure. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime were administered. Later that day, melena occurred.

The patient had been well until 21 days before this admission, when myalgias, arthralgias, chills, fever (with a temperature of 39.2\u00b0C), and upper respiratory symptoms occurred. Seven days later, he was seen by his physician because of worsening symptoms. A rapid test for influenza virus was reportedly negative. A diagnosis of possible influenza was made, and supportive care was advised. The next day, he was seen in the emergency department of another hospital. A chest radiograph reportedly showed evidence of pneumonia in the left upper lobe. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered intravenously, azithromycin and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home. Two days later, 11 days before this admission, the patient called his physician because of persistent symptoms; prednisone and cough syrup were prescribed. After 2 more days, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of another hospital. He reported exhaustion, fever (with a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C) despite having taken acetaminophen, and cough with blood-tinged sputum and pleuritic chest pain that prevented him from sleeping. On examination, he had dyspnea. The blood pressure was 148/71 mm Hg, the pulse between 88 and 120 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air at rest. There were crackles at the left lung base and left axillary region. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph revealed a dense infiltrate on the left side. A diagnosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia was made, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin were administered. Laboratory Data. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained 6 days before this admission (Figure 1A and 1B) showed severe consolidation in the left upper lobe, relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, a trace left pleural effusion, and no obvious lymphadenopathy. Subsequent portable anteroposterior chest radiographs that were obtained during the next 5 days (Figure 1C) revealed further opacification of the left lung, with predominant involvement of the upper lobe, and worsening multifocal consolidation in the right lung that was most severe in the right upper lobe. Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs that were obtained 6 days before this admission (Panels A and B, respectively) show severe consolidation in the left upper lobe, relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, and a trace left pleural effusion. A portable anteroposterior portable chest radiograph that was obtained during the next 5 days with the patient in the supine position (Panel C) shows nearly complete consolidation in the left lung and worsening, multifocal consolidation in the right lung that is most severe in the right upper lobe. A portable anteroposterior chest radiograph that was obtained on admission with the patient in the supine position (Panel D) shows placement of endotracheal and esophagogastric tubes, as well as a further increase in bilateral multifocal consolidation, without pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. Vancomycin therapy was initiated on the third day at the other hospital, and imipenem therapy was initiated on the fifth day. On the sixth day (4 days before admission to this hospital), hypoxemia occurred, and an increasing amount of supplemental oxygen was required. The level of \u03b11-antitrypsin was 270 mg per deciliter (reference range, 93 to 209). The anion gap and blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, IgG, and IgM were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was transferred to the medical ICU. Bronchoscopic examination revealed purulent secretions, without mucous plugs or masses. Cultures of sputum specimens were negative. Echocardiography revealed normal biventricular function and wall motion, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 to 65%. On the ninth day at the other hospital, bilevel positive airway pressure was administered, with some improvement. Later that day, the trachea was electively intubated and methylprednisolone was administered. Cultures of the sputum grew candida species; blood cultures were negative. On the 10th day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital (according to his family\u2019s wishes) and admitted to the medical ICU. Medications at the time of transfer were fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine by intravenous infusions, as well as vecuronium, imipenem, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, pantoprazole, ondansetron, methylprednisolone, sodium succinate, acetaminophen, enoxaparin, albuterol by nebulizer, fluticasone nasal spray, and nystatin suspension. The patient had gout, for which he took indomethacin as needed. He had received an influenza vaccination earlier that season. He had no known allergies. He was married, had adult children, and lived in a semirural area of New England. He worked in manufacturing and had traveled for work to Indonesia and Japan during the month before this admission and to northern New England and the region surrounding the St. Lawrence River basin frequently during the previous year. His coworkers had not been ill. He reportedly did not participate in outdoor sports activities. He had a history of 40 pack-years of smoking and had stopped smoking 6 months before this admission; he drank alcohol infrequently and did not use illicit drugs. His mother and sister had \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, his mother had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and his father had died at 63 years of age from myocardial infarction. On examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, and afebrile. The blood pressure was 89/22 mm Hg, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute while he was receiving ventilatory support. There were coarse breath sounds bilaterally and diffuse 2+ edema of the arms and legs; the heart sounds and abdomen were normal. The plasma anion gap and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, as were blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, globulin, amylase, lipase, IgG, IgM, C3, and C4; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed cloudy, yellow urine, with 1+ albumin and 2+ urobilinogen by dipstick. There were 5 to 10 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, a few squamous cells, very few transitional cells, and very few renal tubular cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 20 to 100 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. A chest radiograph that was obtained at the time of admission to this hospital revealed placement of endotracheal and esophagogastric tubes. There was a further increase in severe bilateral multifocal consolidation, without pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion (Figure 1D). The fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) was increased to 1.00, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) rose to 93 mm Hg, with an oxygen saturation of 95%. Methylprednisolone, meropenem, and continuous infusions of fentanyl, vasopressin, and propofol were administered; imipenem was discontinued. Gram\u2019s staining of a sputum specimen revealed a moderate amount of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and no organisms; testing for antigens to adenovirus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses.

Two months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient\u2019s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her migraines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was soreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement. Five days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was instructed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital. In the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not enlarged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist. One month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the current presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or movements. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist. On the current presentation to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improvement in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxicillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration. On examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishihara color test, all plates were identified with the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vision. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thinning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye. Funduscopic Images.A funduscopic examination was performed 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photograph of the right eye (Panel A), the optic disk shows pallor as compared with the optic disk of the left eye (Panel B), as well as blurred margins due to swelling (asterisks) and subtle evidence of abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect (arrow). A follow-up funduscopic examination was performed 16 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photograph of the right eye (Panel C), the optic disk shows increased pallor, decreased swelling, and greater prominence of the abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect, a finding consistent with optociliary shunt vessels. The blood creatinine level was 0.56 mg per deciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive protein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value, <8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for antibodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A diagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was considered. Because the patient was near delivery, further treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later. Six days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were normal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibodies against aquaporin-4. MRI of the head (Figure 2), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated enhancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of associated orbital edema or other orbital abnormalities. There was a punctate hyperintense focus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion. MRI of the Head.On admission to this hospital, approximately 9 weeks after the onset of symptoms, MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences (Panels A and B, respectively) show prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with abnormal increased homogeneous enhancement (arrows). A coronal T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence (Panel C) shows diffuse hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without adjacent orbital edema. Approximately 2 months later, follow-up MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences (Panels D and E, respectively) show similar segmental enlargement and abnormal enhancement of the intraorbital right optic nerve (arrows). A coronal T2-weighted STIR sequence (Panel F) shows similar hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without inflammatory changes in the orbital fat. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was administered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral prednisone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone. During the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional headache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pupillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Figure 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pallor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Follow-up MRI of the head (Figure 2) revealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before this evaluation, when cloudy vision in both eyes developed gradually over the course of the day. Three days later, he sought medical attention at the emergency department of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. On arrival, he reported fatigue. He also reported that the rash, joint pain, and stiffness associated with his psoriatic arthritis had recently worsened. Sixteen years before this evaluation, the patient had had laser surgery for a retinal tear in the left eye. Ten months before this evaluation, he had had an episode ofPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia that led to an evaluation for and diagnosis of HIV infection, and he had begun taking antiretroviral medications 2 months before this evaluation. Six weeks before this evaluation, he had been admitted to another hospital because of hypotension, hyponatremia, pancytopenia, and acute kidney injury; the serum alkaline phosphatase level was elevated, the CD4 count and blood cortisol level were low, and blood cultures had no growth. Adrenal insufficiency, disseminated infection withMycobacterium avium\u2013intracellulare,and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome were suspected. Antiretroviral medications were stopped, and azithromycin, rifabutin, ethambutol, hydrocortisone, and fludrocortisone were administered, as was trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole three times weekly. Two weeks before this evaluation, emtricitabine, tenofovir, ritonavir, and darunavir were again initiated. The patient had no known allergies. He lived with his husband, did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs, and drank alcohol socially. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The pulse was 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were equally round and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Examination of extraocular motility revealed full motility in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg in the right eye and 7 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ injection of the conjunctivae, 2+ cells in the right anterior chamber, 4+ cells in the left anterior chamber, no hypopyon, and diffuse fine and large keratic precipitates on the corneas. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed 1+ vitreous cells and normal fundi with cup-to-disk ratios of 0.3 bilaterally. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, anion gap, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, glucose, uric acid, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was discharged home with topical ophthalmic prednisolone for presumed psoriatic arthritis\u2013associated iritis. Laboratory Data. Five days later, the patient was seen at a follow-up visit, and cloudy vision persisted. The patient also reported that decreased hearing and difficulty balancing had developed synchronously with his ocular symptoms. On examination, visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Anisocoria was present in both bright and dim lighting conditions; there was a subtle relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 11 mm Hg in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed trace injection of the superior conjunctiva of the left eye, 1+ cells in the anterior chambers, posterior synechiae at the 3 o\u2019clock position of the right eye, extensive posterior synechiae of the left eye, and diffuse fine and large keratic precipitates on the corneas that were more abundant in the left eye than in the right eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed normal fundi, 1+ vitreous cells in the right eye, and 2+ vitreous cells in the left eye. A diffuse rash characterized by erythematous plaques and overlying white scale was present and involved the face, abdomen, back, arms, legs, palms, and soles (Figure 1). Results of serologic testing that had been performed during the emergency department visit 5 days earlier were received. The angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme level was 80 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67), and the lysozyme level 14.9 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 7.0 to 15.0). Antinuclear antibodies were absent, HLA-B27 was present, and a screening test for antibodies toBorrelia burgdorferiwas positive. Topical ophthalmic prednisolone was continued, and ophthalmic cyclopentolate was prescribed for the presumptive diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis\u2013associated iritis. Photograph of the Hands.The patient had a rash characterized by erythematous plaques and overlying white scale involving the face, abdomen, back, arms, legs, feet, and hands, including the palms. Eleven days after the initial presentation, the patient was seen by an otolaryngologist because his hearing loss and unsteadiness had worsened. An audiogram revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss that was worse on the left side than on the right. Later that day, the patient returned to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary because of worsened visual cloudiness and a new floater in the right eye. On examination, the visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/375 in the left eye. Anisocoria was present. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. The intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed extensive keratic precipitates on the corneas, 4+ cells in the right anterior chamber, and 3+ cells in the left anterior chamber. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed 3+ vitreous cells in the right eye with 2+ vitreous haze and 4+ vitreous cells in the left eye with 4+ vitreous haze. There were many small, yellow bilateral inferotemporal preretinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography revealed shadowing from vitreous opacities and a normal foveal contour in the right eye; in the left eye, there was a poor view of the retina, and an image of the macula could not be obtained. Fluorescein angiography revealed a hazy view of the right eye with staining of the peripheral retina, particularly inferiorly, as well as a very hazy view of the left eye with some leakage and staining of the retina nasally and temporally (Figure 2). A repeat test forB. burgdorferiantibodies was negative. Imaging Studies of the Right Eye.A wide-angle fundus photograph (Panel A) shows areas of vitreous haze, as well as multiple inferotemporal white dots overlying an oval area of mild, diffuse retinal whitening (the green color is an artifact). A wide-angle late frame from a fluorescein angiogram (Panel B) shows blocked fluorescence from the areas of vitreous haze and the multiple inferotemporal white dots; there does not appear to be any leakage from the disk, macula, or retinal vessels. An optical coherence tomographic image, obtained at the center of the macula (Panel C), shows a diminished signal temporally, presumably from the vitreous haze; the retinal layers appear intact, and there is no macular edema or subretinal fluid.

The patient had been well until 5 weeks before this evaluation, when he slipped and fell onto the pavement during a vacation in Haiti. Left hip pain developed immediately, and he had difficulty getting up after the fall. The patient rested and took ibuprofen, but the pain did not decrease. Two weeks later, after returning to the United States, the patient went to the emergency department of another hospital and reported that the pain had progressively increased and that he was unable to bear weight on the left leg. He had been previously healthy, was taking no medications, and had no known allergies. He lived in an urban area of New England with his girlfriend, drove a bus, and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He was born in Haiti and had returned there frequently after moving to New England during childhood. His father had hypertension and diabetes mellitus; there was no known family history of bone or soft-tissue cancer or of venous thromboembolism. On examination, the blood pressure was 154/99 mm Hg, and the other vital signs were normal. There was tenderness over the greater trochanter of the left femur, and the pain increased with rotation of the left hip. Imaging studies were obtained. A frontal radiograph showed a lytic lesion, measuring 4.8 cm by 3.9 cm, involving the left femoral neck and greater trochanter, with cortical thinning (Figure 1). A region of cortical discontinuity raised concerns about cortical breakthrough or a pathologic fracture. Radiograph of the Left Hip.A frontal radiograph of the left hip shows a lytic lesion involving the left femoral neck and greater trochanter (arrows). The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and ibuprofen, oxycodone, enoxaparin, amlodipine, docusate, and senna were administered. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home and advised to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon at this hospital. The patient was seen in the orthopedic surgery clinic 3 weeks after he had fallen. He reported that the pain had decreased but continued to be present during ambulation and when he slept on his left side. On examination, there was tenderness in response to deep palpation over the greater trochanter of the left femur. A computed tomography (CT)\u2013guided core-needle biopsy of the lytic bone lesion was performed; histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed myxoid chondrosarcoma. Four weeks after the patient had fallen, he returned to the orthopedic surgery clinic and reported that the pain persisted but had decreased in severity. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A CT scan of the chest, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of thoracic metastases. Surgical resection of the femoral tumor was scheduled for the following week. Laboratory Data. The day before this evaluation, the patient underwent proximal femoral replacement surgery; the left proximal femur was resected, and the hip was reconstructed with the use of a cementless bipolar endoprosthetic implant. The procedure was complicated by a posteriorly oriented crack in the femur that occurred during implantation of the prosthesis. The resection specimen showed myxoid chondrosarcoma (grade 2/3). On macroscopic examination, the tumor measured 3.5 cm by 3.0 cm by 2.5 cm and involved the neck and greater trochanter of the femur (Figure 2A). The tumor infiltrated adjacent cortical and cancellous bone (Figure 2B) and was composed of mononucleate and binucleate cells embedded in abundant myxoid stroma (Figure 2C). On immunohistochemical staining for S100, the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive; this nonspecific stain is positive in virtually all cartilaginous cancers, including chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The tumor was accompanied by a fracture callus (Figure 2D). There was no evidence of vascular invasion, and all resected margins were negative for tumor. Resection Specimen of the Proximal Left Femur.A cross section of the proximal left femur shows a neoplasm with focal myxoid changes (Panel A). Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows that the tumor infiltrates cancellous bone (Panel B) and that the tumor is a cellular myxoid neoplasm with large hyperchromatic and frequently binucleated nuclei (Panel C); the cartilage is surrounded by reactive bone that represents a fracture callus (Panel D). After completion of the surgery, the patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit, where he was initially sleepy but arousable; within 2 hours, he was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, as well as responding appropriately to questions and using patient-controlled analgesia with a morphine infusion pump. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Postoperative radiographs of the left hip and femur showed a nondisplaced fracture of the distal femoral diaphysis extending from the distal tip of the femoral implant to the distal femoral metaphysis. The patient was transferred to the inpatient unit. The next morning, 12 hours after the conclusion of surgery, the patient reported that his pain was well controlled. Two hours later, he was noted to be drowsier and less interactive. He neither spoke spontaneously nor responded verbally to questions, and he opened his eyes only intermittently when he was spoken to by caregivers. Tachycardia developed; the pulse was 110 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Magnesium sulfate was administered. Sixteen hours after the conclusion of surgery, use of the morphine infusion pump was discontinued. The patient became increasingly somnolent. Two hours later, naloxone was administered; there was a mild, transient increase in eye opening and an increase in heart rate to 137 beats per minute, and hypertension developed, with a blood pressure of 202/107 mm Hg. Metoprolol was administered; the pulse decreased to 106 beats per minute, and the blood pressure to 143/83 mm Hg. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C. Laboratory test results obtained 24 hours after the conclusion of surgery are shown inTable 1. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Medical consultation was requested for persistent somnolence. On evaluation by the consulting physician, the patient was unable to answer any questions. Medications included enoxaparin, amlodipine, a multivitamin, and intravenous fluids. On examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/89 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation between 95% and 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was somnolent but opened his eyes in response to loud verbal stimuli and intermittently executed simple actions, including wiggling his toes and squeezing the examiner\u2019s hand, after being repeatedly instructed to do so. The patient responded to trapezius pinching by grimacing symmetrically, and he strongly withdrew from painful stimulation of the hands and the right foot. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, constricting from 3 mm to 2 mm. There was mild nuchal rigidity, and Kernig\u2019s sign was present. Examination of the heart revealed persistent tachycardia and was otherwise normal. The incision in the left leg was well approximated and had no surrounding erythema; there was no crepitus on palpation of the soft tissues around the incision. The remainder of the examination was normal. Urinalysis showed 1+ occult blood, 1+ leukocyte esterase, a specific gravity of 1.017, and a pH of 5.0; there were 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field, 10 to 20 white cells per high-power field, and 5 to 10 hyaline casts per low-power field. A serum toxicology screen was negative; a urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates and benzodiazepines. Specimens of urine and blood were obtained for culture. The patient was transferred to the medicine service for additional evaluation and treatment. On examination 27 hours after the conclusion of surgery, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 140 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/86 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient opened his eyes in response to voice and painful stimuli; he did not follow commands. The gaze was slightly deviated to the upper right, and there were occasional roving eye movements.

The patient had been well until approximately 7 months before admission, when low-grade fevers and fatigue occurred; the fevers were associated with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg. Five months before admission, pain in his right arm and leg developed. Imaging performed at another hospital revealed deep venous thromboses, and analysis of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a white-cell count of 33,000 per cubic millimeter, with 53% blasts. Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen reportedly revealed 74% lymphoid blasts. A diagnosis of B-cell ALL was made, and cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL translocation). Induction chemotherapy with a standard multidrug regimen, including cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, and dasatinib, was administered. Six weeks after the diagnosis was made, follow-up examination of another bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed morphologically complete remission. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital for a consultation about allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. He underwent consolidation chemotherapy while an HLA-matched unrelated donor was identified through the National Marrow Donor Program. Plans were then made to proceed with HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning. Five months after the diagnosis of ALL and 3 days before the patient's admission for the transplantation, pathological examination of another bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed continued complete remission. One day before admission, a triple-lumen tunneled catheter was placed. The next day, he was admitted to this hospital. The fevers and fatigue that had occurred before the diagnosis of ALL had resolved. The patient had a history of low-back pain and intravenous opiate use. Maintenance chemotherapy, including 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib, was stopped 2 weeks before admission; medications on admission included enoxaparin and oxycodone. Palifermin was administered 3 days before admission, for prevention of mucositis. The patient had no known allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for more than 25 years (and continued to do so), drank alcohol rarely, and stopped opiate use after receiving the diagnosis of cancer. He lived alone in New England, had one child, and was disabled because of this illness. He was of Native American ancestry. His mother and maternal grandmother had died; both had had lung cancer. The patient's maternal aunt had breast cancer, and his father had multiple sclerosis. On examination, the vital signs were normal and the weight was 98 kg. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 1 indicating that the patient is ambulatory but restricted in terms of physically strenuous activity, and 5 indicating death); the score on the Karnofsky performance scale was 90 (on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating that the patient has no symptoms, 90 indicating that the patient is able to perform normal activities with minor signs or symptoms of disease, and 0 indicating death). The abdomen was soft, without tenderness, distention, or organomegaly. The skin of the right arm had numerous scars and chronic superficial thromboses, features that were consistent with previous intravenous drug use. The remainder of the examination was normal. Results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and total and direct bilirubin; other test results are shown inTable 1. The administration of allopurinol, famciclovir, ursodiol, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was begun, and narcotic analgesic agents were continued. During the first week, the patient underwent total-body irradiation and the administration of high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. He also agreed to participate in a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of antithymocyte globulin (ATG), administered 3 days before stem-cell transplantation, for the prevention of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01295710). The administration of fluconazole and ciprofloxacin as infectious disease prophylaxis was begun on the day before transplantation, as was tacrolimus for the prevention of GVHD; trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. Laboratory Data. On hospital day 9, HLA-matched unrelated-donor peripheral-blood stem cells were infused. As expected, pancytopenia occurred and persisted for many days thereafter; test results are shown inTable 1. Severe mucositis and diarrhea developed, and total parenteral nutrition was initiated for nutritional support. On hospital day 13 (day 4 after transplantation) and intermittently thereafter as needed, packed red cells and platelets were transfused. On hospital day 15 (day 6 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 38.4\u00b0C. Fluconazole was continued, ciprofloxacin and famciclovir were stopped, and intravenous cefepime, vancomycin, and acyclovir were begun; the fever resolved within 32 hours. Loperamide was administered for diarrhea. Episodes of epistaxis and melena occurred on hospital day 18 (day 9 after transplantation) and intermittently thereafter; aminocaproic acid was administered for the prevention of bleeding due to refractory thrombocytopenia, despite multiple platelet transfusions. On hospital day 21 (day 12 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 38.4\u00b0C, and fevers with associated episodes of confusion and hallucinations persisted daily thereafter. Fluconazole was stopped, and micafungin was started. The weight was 106 kg, and there was swelling of the face, erythema and ulceration of the throat and mouth, and edema of the arms and legs. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions. Test results are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures were sterile. Furosemide was administered, without improvement. Four days later, abdominal distention and pain that was localized to the right lower quadrant occurred and was associated with guarding and rebound. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in the upper lungs, opacity in the right lower lobe (suggestive of atelectasis), apparent esophageal-wall thickening, mild pulmonary edema, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. CT of the abdomen, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed changes consistent with acute retrocecal appendicitis and inflammation of the cecum, as well as hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal edema, free fluid, and innumerable subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes (Figure 1). Image of the Abdomen.A sagittal reconstruction of a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material on day 16 after stem-cell transplantation, shows cecal-wall thickening, a thickened retrocecal appendix, and periappendiceal inflammatory changes (arrow). A small amount of free fluid is present. Surgical consultants evaluated the patient and determined that he had a very high operative risk, and conservative therapy was recommended. All oral intake was stopped. Metronidazole was administered; however, pain and signs of peritonitis worsened and fevers persisted. Blood cultures remained sterile, and testing of the stool forClostridium difficiletoxin was negative. The next day, the patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). On examination in the ICU, the temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/70 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air, and the weight 108 kg. He appeared uncomfortable and inattentive. The oral mucosa was erythematous, and there were ulcerations of the lips, oral cavity, and throat. The jugular vein was distended above the right atrium, and the jugular venous pressure was 10 to 12 cm of water. Breath sounds were decreased at the right lung base. Bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was distended and slightly firm to palpation, with tenderness to percussion throughout, rebound and guarding in the right lower quadrant, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. There was 3+ pitting edema to the sacrum. The rest of the examination was normal. The plasma lactic acid concentration was normal. Chest radiography revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema. Supplemental oxygen and additional furosemide were administered; infusion of total parenteral nutrition was stopped. On hospital day 27 (day 18 after transplantation), the temperature rose to 40.6\u00b0C. The blood pressure was 139/94 mm Hg, the pulse 112 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A repeat CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no substantial change.

The patient came to the hospital for a routine annual examination to establish adult care. He reported a 3-year history of bilateral breast enlargement, with no nipple discharge. He had occasional morning erections, had never been sexually active, and did not masturbate. Approximately 4 years before this evaluation, increased thirst and fluid consumption and frequent urination (four to five times during the day and up to three times each night) had developed. The patient\u2019s parents reportedly worried that he might have diabetes, but a urinary glucose screen was negative and further evaluation was not pursued. In recent months, the frequency of urination had decreased and thirst was normal. He also reported a several-year history of blurred vision, which had been corrected with glasses; he had no diplopia and had occasional headaches after exertion. Puberty was reportedly normal. Approximately 8 months before this presentation, the frequency of shaving decreased from weekly to every 2 weeks. Generalized nocturnal tonic\u2013clonic seizures and focal seizures involving the right leg had occurred when the patient was between 6 and 13 years of age (approximately twice yearly, for a total of 10 to 13 generalized seizures); carbamazepine had been prescribed until the patient was 14 years of age, after which the seizures did not recur. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed at another hospital when the patient was 7 years of age, had reportedly revealed no abnormalities. His wisdom teeth had been extracted 6 months before this evaluation. He had recent constipation and a chronic pilonidal cyst. He took no medications and had no known allergies.

On the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and \u201cweird.\u201d A fingerstick blood glucose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he provided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone consultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal. Point-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. The blood levels of lipase, magnesium, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Radiographs of the chest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cerebrovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Figure 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effusion. There was a left adrenal nodule that measured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Initial Imaging Studies.An axial image from CT angiography of the head (Panel A), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows nonspecific mild white-matter changes (arrowheads) and a nonspecific small right-peritrigonal calcification (arrow). A coronal image from CT angiography of the chest (Panel B), obtained after the administration of contrast material, shows no pulmonary edema, consolidation, or pneumothorax. An axial image from CT angiography of the abdomen (Panel C), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows a left adrenal nodule (arrow) with an attenuation level of less than 10 Hounsfield units, a finding consistent with an adenoma. Normal saline with 5% dextrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and combative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intravenous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intravenously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night. Sixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The results of electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, without epileptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with potassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or subacute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnormalities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. MRI of the Head.MRI of the head confirmed the findings on CT, showing no acute or subacute infarction, mass, or acute intracranial hemorrhage. A T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel A) and a susceptibility-weighted image (Panel B) show right-peritrigonal signal abnormalities (arrows) that correlate with the small calcification observed on CT, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavernous malformation or sequelae of previous infection or inflammation. The T2-weighted FLAIR image (Panel A) also shows nonspecific mild white-matter changes (arrowhead). A diffusion-weighted image (Panel C) shows no abnormal restricted diffusivity. The patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of seizure. The temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respiratory effort appeared increased. He was somnolent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as \u201cpins and needles.\u201d Over the course of several days, the paresthesia extended to the feet. Six weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted approximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetaminophen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain. Two weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the fingertips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot. Screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10 nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1(thiamine) level 149.1 nmol per liter (reference range, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12(cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter (173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1) was performed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material. MRI of the Head.MRI of the head was performed 5 days before the current presentation. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Panels B and C) show mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter (Panel C, arrow), with a dominant lesion in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata (Panels A and B, arrows). There was no associated abnormal enhancement. The patient was referred to a neurology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexterity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articulation of his speech, and he had no dysphonia, dysphagia, or shortness of breath. Other medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several roommates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced consumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethylamide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His maternal grandfather had diabetes, and his paternal grandfather had gastric cancer. The patient was alert and interactive and followed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive.

The patient had been well until 2 years before the current evaluation, when episodes of mild, nonproductive coughing developed and occurred multiple times daily. Between 13 months and 10 months before the current evaluation, three febrile illnesses occurred, with temperatures up to 38.9\u00b0C. After the third illness, the patient noted dyspnea with exertion. She was seen by her physician for an outpatient evaluation; a chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Oral azithromycin and combined inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol fumarate dihydrate were administered. Sixteen days after the outpatient evaluation, dyspnea worsened and was associated with fevers and chest congestion. On evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital, a chest radiograph reportedly showed pulmonary findings suggestive of possible scarring or consolidation; levofloxacin was administered. Ten days later, computed tomography (CT), performed according to a pulmonary emboli protocol, was reportedly negative. An echocardiogram reportedly showed normal left ventricular function and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Seven months before this evaluation, results of pulmonary-function tests were thought to be consistent with obstructive lung disease (Table 1). The level of \u03b11-antitrypsin was normal. During the next 4 months, the patient noted increased dyspnea while she was climbing stairs and walking fast. Approximately 4.5 months before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were repeated (Table 1). Additional testing revealed allergies to shellfish, dust mites, oak, and birch. Results of Pulmonary-Function Testing. Twenty-seven days before this evaluation, the patient returned to her physician\u2019s office because of increasing dyspnea; albuterol (by nebulizer) and prednisone were administered. One week later, on examination by a pulmonologist at another clinic, the blood pressure was 147/96 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air at rest; the remainder of the examination was normal. Thirteen days before this evaluation, pulmonary-function tests were performed. The results are shown inTable 1. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the left lower lobe (involving the basilar segments of both lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the inferior lingular segment), with accompanying mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was a small focus of atelectasis or scarring in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, but the lungs otherwise showed no focal abnormality. There was a small hiatal hernia. The patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported increasing dyspnea and fatigue with mild exertion during the previous 3 months that had required rest after she walked one block or climbed one flight of stairs, as well as increasing frequency of upper-airway tightness and, for 4 days before this presentation, a productive cough with green sputum. She also had had fevers and weight loss of 2.5 kg during the previous month. She had hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, hypertensive disorder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and lichen sclerosus, and she had undergone a total knee replacement. She had smoked one to two packs of cigarettes weekly for 10 years as a young adult. Medications were amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, montelukast, a multivitamin, and vitamin C (orally); albuterol and budesonide\u2013formoterol (by inhalation); betamethasone dipropionate ointment, clobetasol propionate ointment, and estradiol vaginal cream (by topical application); cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion; and fluticasone furoate nasal spray. She had no known allergies to medications. She was married and had two adult children and two dogs. She was a manager in a medical field and reported no known home or occupational exposures. She lived in a suburban area and had traveled to Europe several months earlier. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, her sister had the left ventricular noncompaction syndrome, and her children were healthy. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/63 mm Hg, the pulse 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. The lungs were clear, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, IgA, IgM, IgE, and \u03b11-antitrypsin were normal, as were results of testing for rheumatoid factor, tests of renal and liver function, and serum protein electrophoresis. Testing was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies and antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, Scl-70, Jo, Ro, La,Aspergillus fumigatus, A. pullulans, A. flavus, Thermoactinomyces sacchari, T. candidus, T. vulgaris, Micropolyspora faeni,and pigeon sera. Other test results are shown inTable 2. Laboratory Data. CT of the chest was performed (Figure 1), after the intravenous administration of contrast material, according to an interstitial lung disease protocol (which includes high-resolution scans obtained during inspiration and expiration and with the patient in the prone position). The scans showed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes and mild, diffuse bronchial-wall thickening. There was no difference in the attenuation of the lung parenchyma on expiratory images, as compared with inspiratory images; this finding is suggestive of air trapping. On the expiratory images, there was no lobular or geographic heterogeneity in lung attenuation, a finding indicative of a diffuse process. Axial CT Scans of the Chest.Contrast-enhanced CT scans, obtained according to an interstitial lung disease protocol, show mild cylindrical bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes, with trace accompanying bronchial-wall thickening (Panel A, arrows). There is no difference in lung attenuation between the inspiratory image (Panel B, circle; average attenuation, \u2212908 Hounsfield units) and the expiratory image (Panel C, circle; average attenuation, \u2212904 Hounsfield units), a finding indicative of diffuse air trapping. Eight days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic, a bronchoscopic examination was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the right middle lobe and lingula revealed clear and colorless fluid, with three nucleated cells per microliter (34% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, 6% eosinophils, and 32% macrophages or lining cells) and no evidence of pepsin A or galactomannan antigen. Cytologic examination revealed no viral cytopathic changes, fungal elements, or malignant cells. Gram\u2019s staining revealed very few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and cultures were negative for bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. During the 11 days after the bronchoscopic examination, increased dyspnea occurred, with associated intermittent low-grade fevers. Test results are shown inTable 2. A chest radiograph showed a patchy right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis or aspiration. Albuterol (by nebulizer or by inhaler with a spacer) and a course of azithromycin were administered, and the patient\u2019s condition eventually returned to baseline. Thirty-four days after the evaluation in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital, flexible bronchoscopic examination revealed prominent scarring between the arytenoids, marked inflammation in the subglottic space, scattered whitish secretions with marked airway inflammation throughout the trachea and right and left bronchial trees, and mild ectasia of the central airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the right and left lungs was submitted for microbiologic and cytologic examination and revealed no evidence of viral or bacterial infection.

The patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was running, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and associated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sitting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food-related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur. Approximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as \u201cmy heart beating out of my chest.\u201d He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had \u201ccrampy\u201d discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evaluation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise. On evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent allergic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history included attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evaluation and the other 1 month before this evaluation; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications. The patient worked in the financial sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Multiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps removed in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension. On examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms), the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings obtained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglobin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were undetectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnormalities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction. Electrocardiograms and Transthoracic Echocardiograms.Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained 15 years before the current presentation (Panel A), 5 years before the current presentation (Panel B), and at the time of the current presentation (Panel C). Anterior T-wave abnormalities from V1to V3are present on the ECG obtained at the time of the current presentation and on the ECG obtained 5 years earlier but not on the ECG obtained 15 years earlier. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained in the parasternal short-axis view of the heart show normal origins of the left coronary artery (Panel D, arrowheads) and of the right coronary artery (Panel E, arrowheads), as well as another vessel anterior to the aorta with an unclear origin (Panel F, arrows). Ao denotes aorta. An ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was performed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maximum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.

The patient had been in his usual health until several weeks before presentation, when hoarseness, sore throat, and increasing fatigue developed. At the urging of his family, he was seen by his physician in an outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported hoarseness, increasing facial puffiness, and periorbital swelling, with no chest pain, dyspnea, or new joint pains or muscle aches. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. Two months earlier, the creatinine level was 2.22 mg per deciliter (196 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), which was stable, as compared with values obtained the previous year. He also had hypothyroidism, with a normal thyrotropin level 8 months earlier (3.38 \u03bcU per milliliter [reference range, 0.40 to 5.00]), as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal motility disorder, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic back pain, depression related to the death of his wife several years before, and recurrent urinary tract infections. In the past, he had had pneumonia and had undergone angioplasty of the right renal artery (10 years earlier), a cholecystectomy, a lobectomy of the right middle lobe due to a spiculated nodule that was found to be benign, photoselective vaporization of the prostate due to obstructive benign prostatic hypertrophy (2 months before this presentation), and wrist surgery. Medications included atenolol, vitamin D3, a fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhaler, aspirin, citalopram, a fluticasone nasal spray, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and levothyroxine. Lisinopril had caused a cough, and zolpidem tartrate had caused nightmares. The patient was retired and lived alone. He could independently perform activities of daily living, and he managed his own medications. His three children lived nearby and were in frequent contact with him, but he came to most medical appointments unaccompanied. He was under the regular care of an internist, a nephrologist, a cardiologist, and a urologist. Immunizations were up to date. He had stopped smoking many years earlier and did not drink alcohol. His father had died of liver cancer, and a son had sarcoidosis; his two other children were healthy. On examination, the patient was pleasant, smiling, and in no distress; he spoke with a hoarse voice. The blood pressure was 130/72 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air, the weight 86.8 kg (approximately 4.5 kg greater than it had been 1 month earlier), and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 29.9. There was facial swelling and periorbital edema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of glucose, total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, and total bilirubin and the plasma anion gap were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An appointment with an otolaryngologist was scheduled, and the patient returned home. Two days later, when the results of the laboratory tests were known, he was instructed by his physician to stop taking atorvastatin, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled for 9 days later in the outpatient clinic for repeat blood tests. Laboratory Data. Seven days after presentation, the patient called his doctor\u2019s office at his daughter\u2019s urging to report persistent hoarseness and swelling of his face and abdomen, which he indicated had been present for months but had, according to his daughter, worsened recently. Four days later, 11 days after presentation, he was seen in the outpatient clinic, where he reported markedly worsening fatigue, especially after walking, with associated dyspnea, facial edema, weight gain, cough that produced white mucus, and laryngitis. He reported no chest pain or worsening arthralgias and stated that he was taking all his medications. Chest radiographs were obtained. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1) showed no changes, as compared with chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans obtained 9 months previously. In addition to sutures from the lobectomy of the right middle lobe, there were small reticulonodular opacities at the right base, findings suggestive of scarring due to recurrent aspiration or prior infection. No evidence of pulmonary edema, lymphadenopathy, or a mediastinal mass was seen. Chest Radiographs.Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) were obtained 11 days after presentation. The box in each panel shows the area that is enlarged in the inset. There are reticulonodular opacities at the base of the right lung (Panel A, inset) and chain sutures from a lobectomy of the right middle lobe (Panel B, inset). Incidentally noted are a healed right-rib fracture (Panel A, arrowhead) and interposition of the transverse colon between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm (Panels A and B, arrows).

The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nausea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was administered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers. On the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope occurred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solution were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography revealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed.

ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy. Electrocardiographic Studies.An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained on the initial presentation to the emergency department of the other hospital, on the day of the first admission (Panel A), shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute; borderline ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression are present in leads I, II, V5, and V6. An ECG obtained 10 days after the first admission (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute; ST-segment elevation and PR-depression are no longer present. An ECG obtained approximately 9.5 months after the first admission (Panel C) shows sinus tachycardia at a rate of 126 beats per minute; premature atrial and ventricular contractions are present, along with flattening of T waves. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was present. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities. Three hours after arrival, the patient was transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medications, herbal remedies, or nutritional supplements and had no known allergies. His immunizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sudden infant death syndrome. His maternal grandmother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were administered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appointment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the patient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient\u2019s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown inTable 1. ECG was performed. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Figure 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were no longer present. Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric nephrologist and a medical geneticist were scheduled but not kept by the patient. Results of laboratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown inTable 1. Approximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and lightheadedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air.

The patient was in poor health, with end-stage renal disease that required hemodialysis. Two years before the current presentation, pathological examination of a renal-biopsy specimen revealed advanced global glomerulosclerosis with tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as well as collapsing focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, findings that were superimposed on advanced membranous nephropathy. Six months before the current presentation, evaluation at this hospital revealed severe hypertension, hyperkalemia, and azotemia. Hemodialysis was initiated. Three months before the current presentation, initial evaluation for renal transplantation revealed that the patient had received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis 11 years earlier (on the basis of a positive rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test at a 1:2 dilution and a negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis), for which he received three doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine at 1-week intervals; a follow-up RPR test that was performed 4 years before the current presentation was nonreactive. Results of serologic testing for hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus were consistent with protective immunity. Testing was negative for hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and positive for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Shortly thereafter, the patient noted a rash on his forearms that he thought was associated with oxycodone, which he was taking for pain associated with the placement of a new hemodialysis fistula. Three weeks before the current presentation, as part of the pretransplantation evaluation, he was seen by an infectious-disease specialist in the outpatient clinic of this hospital. He reported no recent fevers, chills, or weight loss and no history of eczema, psoriasis, or a similar rash. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Nummular (circular or oval), scaly, plaquelike lesions were present on the trunk, arms, and legs, and there was bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the examination was normal. An RPR test was reactive at a 1:1 dilution. Renal transplantation was postponed, pending evaluation by a dermatologist. During the next 3 weeks, the rash became pruritic and progressed, with more extensive involvement of the torso, arms, and legs. Three days before the current presentation, while awaiting dermatologic consultation, the patient fell and injured his right leg and left shoulder. Three days later, he came to the emergency department of this hospital because of pain with weight bearing and leg swelling. The patient had hypertension, a bicuspid aortic valve, and an ascending and aortic-root aneurysm; 13 years before this presentation, he had had a positive tuberculin skin test with a negative chest radiograph. He had had unintentional weight loss of 12 kg during the previous 2 years. His medications were oxycodone with acetaminophen, calcitriol, calcium acetate, clonidine, diltiazem, labetalol, atorvastatin, sertraline, ergocalciferol, a multivitamin, and, during dialysis, epoetin alfa. He also topically applied an emollient and a 5% lidocaine patch. He had no known drug or food allergies. He was born in Haiti and had moved to the United States 30 years earlier. He was married and retired from work in a medical facility. He had smoked cigarettes for 15 years before stopping 20 years earlier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His parents had died in their 80s, and his siblings and children were well. There was no family history of skin cancer or other dermatologic diseases. On examination, the vital signs were normal. The right leg was erythematous, with increased warmth and tense nonpitting edema on the medial proximal leg, point tenderness on the medial leg below the knee, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, and no findings suggestive of a thrombosed vein. A diffuse rash was present on the torso, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. A radiograph of the knee and leg showed no evidence of a fracture or dislocation. Noninvasive vascular studies of the legs revealed no evidence of deep or superficial venous thrombosis. Vancomycin was administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the observation unit of this hospital. On examination by a dermatologist, the skin type was Fitzpatrick type VI. Large, brown, thin, flat-topped papules were widespread, and many coalesced into polygonal plaques. There was a powdery and occasionally thick scale on the neck, arms, axillae, wrists, dorsal hands, trunk, anterior thighs, legs, and feet (Figure 1). Wrinkling of axillary plaques was present bilaterally. Multiple thin, brown macules and patches with a collarette of scale were present on the palms, and a few were present on the soles. The buttocks and genitalia were spared. Clinical Photographs.On initial evaluation, the patient had diffuse large, brown papules that coalesced into polygonal plaques, and he had a powdery, thick scale on the neck, arms, wrists, and hands (Panel A), as well as on the thighs, legs, and feet (Panel B).

She was reportedly evaluated by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, but no cause for her symptoms was identified. Two months before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened, palpitations and dizziness developed, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, a low blood level of haptoglobin, and an elevated blood level of lactate dehydrogenase. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed schistocytes. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, complement levels were reportedly low, and a low titer of cold agglutinins was present. Testing for antibodies against \u03b22-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin was negative, as was a screening test for lupus anticoagulant. Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and other common respiratory viruses was negative.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 2 years earlier. Packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs\u2019-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia. On the third hospital day, anemia persisted, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a working diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed, and on the sixth hospital day, treatment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization. During the second week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic anemia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65% (reference value, >67%), and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped. During the third week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was continued, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however, the patient still received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treatment, there was no reduction in hemolysis. During the fifth week of the hospitalization, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days, and thrombocytopenia developed. Treatment with glucocorticoids was resumed, and treatment with twice-weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predominance. During the sixth week of the hospitalization, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted, treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also reported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells. Twenty-one years earlier, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 (according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis classification system), estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2013negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy, radiation, and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeutic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and mammography of the breasts, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination. Three years before the current admission, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, latent tuberculosis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admission. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis. On examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaundice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the forearms and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter (254 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter (22 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]).

The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Two weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Stool cultures and tests of the stool forClostridioides difficileantigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. During the next week, the episodes of diarrhea decreased in frequency to once a day; however, the rectal pain persisted.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. One week before this admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because the rectal pain had worsened; she was unable to sit down, and new tenesmus was present. A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed. Three days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the episodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weakness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia. The patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension developed during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed. Ten years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medications, including prednisone and labetalol, without talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she presented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation. Routine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, prednisone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplantation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed. At the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydrocortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allograft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots. The hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 0 per microliter. A peripheral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Figure 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding. A small amount of free fluid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontaneously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi were seen. CT of the Renal Allograft.Coronal and axial images (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show a renal allograft in the right lower quadrant. The transplanted kidney is enlarged and surrounded by extensive perinephric fat stranding (arrows). A small amount of free fluid is also present. There is moderate hydroureteronephrosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contain spontaneously hyperdense material (arrowheads) that is suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing calculi are shown. Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were transfused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglobin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter.

The patient had been well until 7 years of age, when a diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease was made after she presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss (2.3 kg), and fevers. Laboratory testing revealed lactase deficiency and antibodies to outer membrane protein C (OmpC) IgA and bacterial flagellin (CBir1). Colonoscopic examination revealed multiple shallow ulcers throughout the colon, rectum, and cecum. Pathological examination of biopsy specimens obtained on upper and lower endoscopy revealed evidence of acute gastritis, a granuloma in the duodenal bulb, moderately active ileitis, and chronic active colitis, findings consistent with Crohn\u2019s disease. Omeprazole (20 mg twice daily), balsalazide disodium (up to three 750-mg capsules twice daily), and azathioprine (up to 50 mg daily) were administered, and a modified specific carbohydrate diet (without nuts) was begun. Symptoms resolved, and 14 months before the current admission, a routine follow-up endoscopic examination and biopsy revealed no evidence of colitis. During the next 6 months, all medications were discontinued, and the patient remained asymptomatic while on a vegetarian diet. Approximately 5 weeks before the current admission (concurrent with the start of the school year), nonbloody diarrhea developed, occurring three or four times daily. Three weeks before admission, intermittent crampy periumbilical pain developed, radiating to both lower quadrants. Four days before admission, the patient had increased abdominal pain and diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, arthralgias, and fever, with a temperature as high as 38.9\u00b0C. Two days before admission, she was seen in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. The patient rated the pain at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, she was alert. While she was in a supine position, the blood pressure was 108/50 mm Hg and the pulse was 104 beats per minute, and while she was in a standing position, the blood pressure was 100/50 mm Hg and the pulse was 110 beats per minute. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds, and was tender in all four quadrants, without guarding or grimacing. Her stools were watery and foul-smelling, with no visible blood; testing for occult blood was positive. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin and results of liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Testing forClostridium difficiletoxin in the stool was positive; a stool culture for enteric pathogens was negative. Laboratory Data. Treatment with metronidazole (250 mg three times per day with meals) was begun. However, the severity and frequency of pain and diarrhea increased; there were loose, liquid bowel movements four or five times per day. On the morning of admission, the patient had nonbilious, nonbloody emesis after taking metronidazole, and her stools became blood-tinged. She was admitted to this hospital. The patient\u2019s family reported that she had decreased energy and intake of solid food, with a weight loss of 2.2 kg (from a weight of 39 kg 2 months before admission) since the onset of her current illness; she had lost 1 kg in the 2 days before admission. Nine months before admission, she had had a cough for 2 weeks; a chest radiograph and results of complete pulmonary-function testing were normal, and the symptoms resolved. She was taking no other medications; immunizations were reportedly current. She was allergic to tree nuts (anaphylaxis) and peanuts; she had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her mother and three siblings and attended school. She was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her father and sister had Crohn\u2019s disease, her father had arthritis, and her mother had asthma. On examination, the patient appeared to be in mild discomfort. The blood pressure was 112/68 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the temperature 36.0\u00b0C, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air, and the weight 36.8 kg. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with hypoactive bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the periumbilical region and lower quadrants on palpation. The arms and legs were cool, without cyanosis, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin were normal, as were the results of the remaining metabolic laboratory tests. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. Metronidazole, esomeprazole magnesium, ondansetron, ketorolac tromethamine, and crystalloid fluids were administered intravenously, vancomycin was given orally, and acetaminophen and lorazepam were administered as needed for pain and discomfort. In the afternoon of the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.1\u00b0C. In the evening of the second hospital day, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild thickening and increased enhancement of the wall of the terminal ileum and ascending colon, a finding consistent with ileocolitis (Figure 1A). There were reactive lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant, with no evidence of an abscess or fistula. However, there were multiple subpleural lung nodules, measuring up to 13 mm in greatest dimension. These nodules had central hypoattenuation, a feature consistent with central necrosis (Figure 1B and 1C). Imaging Studies.A reconstructed coronal image from a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel A), obtained on the second hospital day, after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon (arrowhead) and incidental nodules at the lung bases (arrows). Axial images of the bases of the right lower and left lower lobes (Panels B and C, respectively) show nodules that have central hypoattenuation (arrows), a feature consistent with central necrosis. A frontal maximum-intensity-projection image from an18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron-emission tomography\u2013CT (FDG-PET\u2013CT) scan (Panel D) shows avid FDG uptake in the lung nodules, including the largest lung nodule, in the lingula (arrow). There is no other abnormal FDG uptake suggestive of an extrathoracic malignant tumor. An axial image from a CT scan of the chest, obtained 4 weeks after discharge, after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows the large lingular nodule (Panel E, arrow). Several of the other nodules have increased in size while others have shrunk, a finding that is not consistent with a malignant process. On the fourth hospital day, CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed additional bilateral pulmonary nodules in a subpleural distribution, measuring up to 13 mm in greatest dimension. Several of the nodules had central hypoattenuation, and other nodules had indistinct margins. The thymus was normal, and there was no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. There was no pleural effusion. The differential diagnosis for these nodules is broad and includes inflammatory, infectious, and malignant entities. Integrated whole-body18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron-emission tomography\u2013CT (FDG-PET\u2013CT) revealed FDG avidity in many of the lung nodules, a finding indicating increased glucose metabolism (Figure 1D). No abnormal extrathoracic uptake was seen, which would have constituted evidence of a primary extrathoracic malignant tumor. Blood cultures were sterile, and urinalysis was normal. By the fourth hospital day, the abdominal pain and diarrhea had resolved. On the seventh hospital day, pulmonary-function tests showed a restrictive lung defect, with decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Figure 2). The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day, while awaiting the results of additional diagnostic tests. Two weeks later, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea on exertion developed. Repeat pulmonary-function tests showed a persistent restrictive defect and worsening carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Figure 2). Results of Pulmonary-Function Testing.Nine months before admission, the patient had normal results of pulmonary-function testing. On admission, testing revealed a mild restrictive pattern, with decreased diffusion. Pulmonary function improved 1 month after the initiation of prednisone therapy and was almost back to the patient\u2019s baseline level 4 months after the initiation of therapy. Pulmonary function declined after prednisone was discontinued, but it improved again after the initiation of infliximab therapy. Twelve months after the initiation of infliximab therapy, the patient was asymptomatic but results of pulmonary-function testing were below her baseline level. DLCOdenotes carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and TLC total lung capacity.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when a headache involving the left temple developed. A similar headache had occurred during an episode of shingles 15 years earlier. He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed, and the headache resolved. Four weeks before the current evaluation, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight, and the patient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo, otorrhea, rhinitis, or sore throat. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination, including a cranial nerve examination, was normal. An audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz (Figure 1A). Word recognition was 96% with the right ear and 84% with the left ear (reference range, 80 to 100). Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears. The patient received a prescription for a 12-day tapering course of oral prednisone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormal findings. Audiograms.An audiogram obtained 4 weeks before evaluation in the rheumatology clinic (Panel A) shows sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. The results are asymmetric, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear; the word recognition score (WRS) is 84% in the left ear. An audiogram obtained 3 days before evaluation in the rheumatology clinic (Panel B), after a course of prednisone therapy, shows worsening of hearing loss in both ears and reduction of the WRS to 64% in the left ear. The pure tone average (PTA) is the average of the hearing levels at three frequencies (500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) of tonal sounds (reference range, 0 to 25 dB HL). The speech reception threshold (SRT) is the softest hearing level at which the patient can repeat back spondaic words (reference range, 0 to 25 dB HL). The WRS indicates the patient\u2019s ability to repeat back words (reference range [good to excellent], 80 to 100%); the scores were obtained with words presented at a level of 72 dB HL in the right ear and 75 db HL in the left ear. The air-conduction threshold is indicated by a circle for the right ear and an X for the left ear. Bone-conduction thresholds are indicated by brackets and arrowheads, which open to the right for the right ear and open to the left for the left ear. HL denotes hearing level. Four weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affiliated with this hospital. Hearing loss had progressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze tracking was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive, with the patient rotated to the left, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90% with the right ear and 64% with the left ear (Figure 1B). Results of tympanometry were normal. The patient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation. Three days later, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing hearing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermittent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vaccine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone, vitamin B12, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs. On examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patient\u2019s eyes were open, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examination, including skin, joint, and neurologic assessments, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), and the C-reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The patient was referred for an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital, which was to take place on the same day. On ophthalmologic evaluation, the patient reported no blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, itching, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses, which he changed daily. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. There was evidence of anterior uveitis, with 7 cells per high-power field in the right anterior chamber and 6 to 7 cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber.

The patient had been in his usual health until 4 days before admission, when increasing fatigue, malaise, headache, intermittent testicular discomfort, yellowed eyes, dark urine, nausea, and diffuse body aches developed and chronic leg pain worsened. No fever, rash, hematuria, dysuria, melena, or neurologic symptoms were present. On the day of admission, he came to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been generally well, with intermittent asthma, acne, and chronic leg pain until 4 months earlier, when he traveled from an urban area of New England to his family's home in North Africa and stayed for 3 months. While he was there, a prolonged cough productive of green sputum developed, associated with fatigue, subjective fevers, chills, drenching night sweats, and intermittent dyspnea at rest, and he reportedly had a weight loss of 9.1 kg. Ten days after his return to New England, and 20 days before this admission, he was seen in the medical clinic at this hospital. On evaluation at that time, the patient appeared well. The weight was 92.7 kg, the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.6, and the pulse 101 beats per minute; the blood pressure and respirations were normal. Evaluation revealed mild acne, nasal turbinates that were boggy and pale and had clear secretions, slight tonsillar enlargement, inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and expiratory wheezes in both lung apexes, and surgical scars on the right leg. The level of platelets and results of hemoglobin electrophoresis were normal, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was normal. A Mantoux tuberculin skin test was negative. The patient was advised to continue the administration of fluticasone and albuterol by inhalers, which had been prescribed as treatment for asthma. He returned home. On the day of admission, he called his physician's office and was advised to go to the emergency department for evaluation. He was subsequently admitted to the hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient had a history of fractures of the right leg after a motor-vehicle accident 3 years earlier, which required internal fixation of the tibia for nonunion, as well as bone and skin grafting; he had persistent chronic leg pain and venous swelling. One year before this admission, after tibial surgery, the hematocrit decreased to 34.4%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 77 fl (normal range, 80 to 100); the anemia resolved within 4 months. Other medications included ginkgo biloba, a multivitamin, and nicotine patches for smoking cessation. He had no known allergies to medication. The patient had emigrated from North Africa to the United States 9 years earlier. He was a student, smoked marijuana and cigarettes, and reported no current alcohol or intravenous drug use. He was sexually active with his girlfriend. While the patient was visiting his family in North Africa, his 14-year-old brother died of an unspecified disease. During that trip, the patient was exposed to sheep and drank unpasteurized cow's milk. His mother had osteopenia; his father and four other siblings were healthy. On examination, the blood pressure was 123/85 mm Hg and the pulse 115 beats per minute; the temperature, respirations, and oxygen saturation were normal. The patient appeared tired, with conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. The second heart sounds were loud, without murmurs. The abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was greatest in the right lower and left upper quadrants; the testicles were diffusely tender, without masses. Mild tenderness was present over the right knee and anterior shin, with healed surgical scars; the remainder of the examination was normal. The platelet count, white-cell differential count, and red-cell indexes (mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were normal, as were the results of coagulation tests and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, lipase, thyrotropin, folate, and vitamin B12. Thick and thin peripheral-blood smears and rapid testing for malaria antigen, antibodies to HIV, and heterophile antibodies were negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test) was negative. Cultures of the blood were obtained. The results of urinalysis were normal, and the stool was guaiac-negative. An electrocardiogram was normal. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs. Narcotic analgesia, ondansetron, dalteparin, phosphorus supplementation, and intravenous fluids were administered. Toxicologic examination of the urine revealed the presence of opiates and cannabinoids. During the next 2 days, jaundice gradually improved. Blood cultures remained sterile.

One year before this presentation, a ballooning lesion had developed in the patient\u2019s left ear canal that partially occluded the lumen and was associated with pruritus and recurrent bleeding. An unknown medication was administered topically into the ear canal, with improvement in both bleeding and pruritus. Two weeks before this presentation, bleeding from the left ear canal recurred, with associated pruritus of both ear canals. The patient was seen by a physician at another clinic, who prescribed an otic suspension (consisting of neomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) and a 5-day course of oral azithromycin, as well as topical clobetasol propionate ointment (0.05%) for pruritus; the symptoms did not improve, and the bleeding did not resolve. She was referred to the outpatient otolaryngology clinic of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The patient reported brief episodes of sharp, stabbing otalgia on the left side, with episodes of disequilibrium that lasted for a few seconds and were not associated with vertigo, tinnitus, or changes in hearing. She had not had recurrent otitis media during childhood, exposure to loud noises, or head trauma with loss of consciousness. She took no other medications and had no known allergies. She worked in a health-related field. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. On examination, the patient appeared to be well, with no craniofacial dysmorphism. A light pink raised lesion (approximately 1.0 cm by 1.0 cm by 0.5 cm), with a cobblestone appearance and several prominent vessels, was present on the posterior tragus of the left ear; on examination with an operating microscope, the lesion extended medially along the anterior wall of the external auditory canal. The eardrums, medial left ear canal, and entire right ear canal were normal. There was no tragal tenderness. A 512-Hz tuning fork was used to show that the Rinne test was positive bilaterally (with air conduction greater than bone conduction) and that, on the Weber test, the sound was located along the midline. The remainder of the examination of the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, pharynx, larynx, neck, ears (for hearing acuity for conversational speech), and third through twelfth cranial nerves was normal, and there was no spontaneous nystagmus. A culture of the left external ear canal grew a moderate amount of coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. Topical nystatin\u2013triamcinolone ointment was administered to the left ear twice daily for 2 weeks, without improvement. One week later, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic.

Approximately 2 months before the patient\u2019s evaluation at this hospital, vertigo developed and resolved spontaneously. One day before evaluation at this hospital, she sought care at another hospital for recurrent dizziness and difficulty walking. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/105 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented, with slow speech, bilateral end-point horizontal nystagmus, and mild dysmetria on the right side on finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing. Strength and sensory function were normal. She had difficulty maintaining a stable stance; her gait was narrow-based and described as \u201cslow and cautious.\u201d The remainder of the examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed an area of ill-defined hypoattenuation that was consistent with vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as regions of white-matter hypoattenuation in both cerebellar hemispheres. Aspirin and atorvastatin were administered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Figure 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an enhancing intraaxial lesion, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 1.7 cm, in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion had internal signal hypointensity that was indicative of necrosis on T1-weighted imaging, as well as surrounding signal hyperintensity that was suggestive of vasogenic edema on T2-weighted imaging. There was local mass effect with effacement of the overlying cerebellar fissures and the fourth ventricle. There was also an enhancing leptomeningeal lesion, measuring 4 mm in diameter, along the left medial frontal lobe in the left superior frontal gyrus, with possible leptomeningeal extension. The lesion was characterized by internal and surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. MRI of the Head.An axial, T1-weighted image obtained after the administration of contrast material (Panel A) and a T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel B) at the level of the fourth ventricle show a ring-enhancing abnormality with a nodular component (Panel A, arrow) and surrounding signal hyperintensity suggestive of vasogenic edema (Panel B, arrow) in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. Intravenous dexamethasone, amlodipine, and labetalol were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital for specialized neurosurgical consultation. On evaluation at this hospital, review of systems was notable for malaise and lethargy, as well as unintentional weight loss of 15 kg during the past year. The patient also reported an increase in urinary frequency without hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain. She had no fever, chills, sinus pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke, which had led to a craniotomy on the right side for evacuation of a \u201cblood clot\u201d 13 years before the current evaluation, with no reported neurologic deficits. The patient reported that, during the admission for craniotomy, she was told that she had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and was treated with an unknown antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen; she could not recall the medications included in the regimen. In addition, she reported that, several years later, further testing revealed that an error had been made and she did not have HIV infection. She reported that ART medications were discontinued at least 3 years before the current evaluation. The patient did not have a history of opportunistic infections or cancer. Three years earlier, a Mantoux tuberculin skin test had been negative. One week earlier, a mammogram had been normal. She had never undergone a colonoscopy or a Papanicolaou test. The patient was born in Ivory Coast, West Africa, and had been living in the United States for more than 20 years. She reported no recent travel. She lived with her children and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was divorced and not sexually active; in her lifetime, she had had one male sexual partner. Her ex-husband and one of her children reportedly had tested negative for HIV. Her father had had a myocardial infarction in his 60s; her mother and sisters were healthy. The patient had not been taking any medications at home before this illness and had no known allergies to medications. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 165/99 mm Hg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.5. The patient was comfortable, alert, and oriented. Her speech was clear, with intact naming and repetition. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full in response to confrontation. She had mild right esotropia and no nystagmus. Her face was symmetric, but there was mild deviation of the tongue to the left. Results of other cranial-nerve testing were normal. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed subtle dysmetria that was greater on the right side than on the left side; there was no dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. Her stance was approximately shoulder-width. Her balance was impaired, and her gait was unsteady and ataxic. Psychomotor slowing was present, and the Romberg sign was absent. An evaluation of power, bulk, tone, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes was normal. She had alopecia and oral thrush. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglobin. An HIV screening test for the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) and HIV-1 p24 antigen was reactive. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was not detected. The CD4+ T-cell count was 39 per microliter (reference range, 348 to 1456). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. A urine sample was obtained for culture. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a mildly enlarged and multinodular left thyroid gland, as well as scattered pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm in diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hypoattenuating hepatic lesion measuring 1.1 cm in the greatest dimension that was consistent with hemangioma, as well as diffuse lytic osseous lesions in the thoracolumbar spine and pelvis.

Seven years before this evaluation, the patient had received a diagnosis of superficial bladder cancer (low grade), for which a transurethral resection was performed. During the next 5 years, urologic evaluation with annual surveillance cystoscopy revealed no evidence of recurrent disease. Urination occurred frequently and urgently, and tolterodine was administered as needed for symptom control. Twenty-one months before the current evaluation, the patient was seen by a urogynecologist for persistent urinary incontinence that occurred with bending over, coughing, and sneezing. Urination occurred up to 12 times daily and twice nightly. The patient reported no hematuria, dysuria, incomplete voiding, high fluid intake, pelvic or vaginal pressure or heaviness, prolapse, or fecal incontinence. On an examination that was limited to the pelvis, the uterus was estimated to be similar in size to the uterus of a pregnant woman at 12 weeks of gestation. The uterus was mobile and nontender, and these features were thought to be consistent with a fibroid. The adnexa were difficult to assess because of the enlarged uterus. Point-of-care urine dipstick testing was positive for blood. On measurement of the postvoiding residual urine volume, 270 ml of urine was left in the bladder. Pelvic ultrasonography was performed, and the patient was referred for pelvic-floor physical therapy. On a pelvic ultrasound image, the uterus measured 8.5 cm by 8.9 cm by 9.6 cm. A heterogeneous mass (measuring 6.4 cm by 7.8 cm by 8.4 cm) was identified in the uterus. There were multiple small areas of hypoechogenicity in the mass that were most likely consistent with cystic changes or necrosis. The mass had some areas of increased peripheral vascularity. The endometrial echocomplex was not well visualized because of distortion by the mass, but the visualized portion measured 6 mm. The ovaries were not identified, but there were no large adnexal masses. Seventeen months before this evaluation, the patient presented to her gynecologist for follow-up. She had completed 3 months of pelvic-floor physical therapy and noted that the urinary incontinence had improved slightly. On examination of the pelvis, the mass was reportedly unchanged in size, but the uterus was estimated to be similar in size to the uterus of a pregnant woman at 16 weeks of gestation. Additional imaging studies were performed. On repeat ultrasonography performed 15 months before this evaluation, the uterus measured 8.9 cm by 9.2 cm by 11.2 cm and had heterogeneous echogenicity. A large fibroid (measuring 7.2 cm by 7.6 cm by 8.0 cm) was present on the left side of the uterus, and it had areas of internal hypoechogenicity that were probably consistent with fluid. One month later, tenderness in the left lower quadrant developed. After 3 days of symptoms, the patient was evaluated at another hospital, where mild leukocytosis was noted. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital, reportedly revealed a cystic lesion (measuring 7.1 cm by 7.4 cm by 7.4 cm) in the uterus that was thought to represent cystic degeneration. The size of the mass on CT was similar to previous measurements of the mass on ultrasonography. Follow-up pelvic ultrasonography at 2-month intervals was recommended. At that time, it was thought that in the absence of vaginal bleeding, the pain was probably caused by a degenerating fibroid, and it was recommended that repeat pelvic ultrasonography be performed in 6 weeks. Pelvic ultrasonography performed 6 weeks later (12 months before this evaluation) revealed a fibroid (measuring 5.6 cm by 6.5 cm by 6.7 cm) on the left side of the uterus that had internal cystic spaces. The fibroid had decreased in overall size since the previous study but had a higher number of cystic components, and it was probably consistent with a large degenerating fibroid. Follow-up pelvic ultrasonography performed 4 months later (8 months before this evaluation) revealed a hypoechoic lesion (measuring 5.2 cm by 5.4 cm by 5.8 cm) that probably represented a uterine fibroid. Eight months later (4 days before this evaluation), pelvic ultrasonography was again performed (Figure 1). This examination revealed that the mass had increased in size to 6.9 cm by 8.8 cm by 10.3 cm and again had central cystic components. The endometrial echocomplex was 4 mm, with no pelvic free fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis was recommended. Pelvic Ultrasound Images.Coronal and sagittal gray-scale ultrasound images (Panels A and B, respectively) show a large, heterogeneous mass (measuring 6.9 cm by 8.8 cm by 10.3 cm) in the uterus. The mass has focal hypoechoic areas (Panel B, arrow) that are suggestive of cystic changes or necrosis. A color Doppler ultrasound image (Panel C) shows some areas of increased peripheral vascularity in the mass (arrow). The patient was referred to the gynecologic oncology clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, she reported transient vulvar itching, urinary incontinence, and no constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, constipation, diarrhea, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, or dysuria. She had never had an abnormal Papanicolaou smear. The patient was gravida 3, para 2 (two vaginal deliveries). Her last mammogram had been obtained 8 months earlier and was reportedly normal; she conducted breast self-examinations regularly. The patient\u2019s medical history included bladder cancer, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Medications were warfarin, metoprolol succinate, atorvastatin, fish oil, lorazepam (as needed), and doxepin, as well as calcium, vitamin D, and a multivitamin. Adverse drug reactions included a rash with sulfa drugs. The patient was married and did aerobic exercise three times weekly. She drank wine twice weekly and had never smoked. There was no family history of cancer. On examination, the patient appeared younger than her stated age. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 173/77 mm Hg. The weight was 66.7 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.6. The abdomen was soft and nontender. Results of pelvic and rectal examinations were unchanged from the results of recent examinations, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic cardiomyopathy and had a history of myocardial infarctions (an inferoposterior myocardial infarction, which had occurred 29 years earlier, and an apical infarction, which had occurred 14 years earlier and for which percutaneous balloon angioplasty of the first marginal branch of the left circumflex artery had been performed). Nine years before the current admission, a cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33% and a reversible anterolateral defect; subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the right coronary artery and in branches of the left circumflex artery. Seven months before the current admission, echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had worsened to 22%, and a subsequent cardiac stress test with radionuclide imaging (performed at this hospital) revealed a markedly dilated left ventricle, with large, dense inferior and lateral scars and associated minimal inferoapical ischemia. Eleven weeks before the current admission, transthoracic echocardiography (performed at this hospital) revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 23%, dilatation of the left atrium (anteroposterior dimension, 39 mm) and left ventricle (end diastolic dimension, 55 mm), diffuse hypokinesis of both ventricles (mild in the right and severe in the left), mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and no pericardial effusion. Three weeks later (8 weeks before the current admission), the patient was seen in the cardiac-arrhythmia clinic of this hospital to be evaluated for the placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD). He reported exertional dyspnea that was consistent with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of II. He had no palpitations, presyncopal symptoms, syncopal events, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His weight was stable. His medications were aspirin, irbesartan, carvedilol, hydrochlorothiazide, isosorbide mononitrate, atorvastatin, metformin, sitagliptin, and loratadine. He was allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins, which caused a rash, and he reported cough with the use of angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. He was married and had adult children. He had a smoking history of 45 pack-years but had stopped smoking 29 years earlier, and he had recently decreased alcohol consumption from 10 drinks per week to 4 on the advice of his clinicians; he did not use illicit drugs. Several relatives had diabetes mellitus. On examination at that visit, the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. The jugular venous pressure was 6 cm of water; the remainder of the examination was normal, with no cardiac murmur or rub. Placement of an ICD was advised. Ten days before the current admission, a dual-chamber ICD system was inserted through the left axillary vein. Intravenous vancomycin was administered immediately before the procedure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient was admitted to this hospital for routine monitoring. Chest radiographs that were obtained after the procedure and the following morning showed the ICD pulse generator on the left side of the chest, with ICD lead tips projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle, as well as clear and inflated lungs, mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (which was stable, as compared with the silhouette seen on earlier radiographs), and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The morning after ICD placement, repeat device interrogation was performed, and all measurements were within acceptable limits. The patient was discharged home later that day. During the next 9 days, he noted occasional mild positional pain at the ICD placement site that was relieved with acetaminophen. No skin changes or swelling at the ICD placement site were noted. Laboratory Data. At 6 p.m. on the day of the current admission, midsternal chest discomfort and associated diaphoresis and mild dyspnea developed suddenly while the patient was watching television. The pain was exacerbated by movement and deep inspiration, did not radiate, was possibly improved by leaning forward, and was distinct from the pain at the ICD placement site that had been previously reported. The patient had no associated headache, light-headedness, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills. He took two acetaminophen tablets for the pain, and after it lasted for more than 1 hour, he sought medical attention. On arrival in the emergency department, approximately 3.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient rated the pain at rest at 0 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The midsternal pain could be reproduced with deep inspiration; he rated that pain at 7 of 10. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, the pulse 78 beats per minute and irregular, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The skin was cool, with no inflammation or hematoma over the ICD placement site. Adhesive strips over the incision were intact. The first and second heart sounds were normal, with no murmur, and the breath sounds were slightly diminished at the bases. The jugular venous pressure was not recorded, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Cardiac telemetry showed sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and phosphorus were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1) showed a new left pleural effusion, with no other clinically significant changes, as compared with the chest radiograph that was obtained immediately after the procedure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits, and the ICD leads appeared to be in a position similar to that on the previous radiograph. Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained on the current admission, show a new left pleural effusion. Cardiac ultrasonography, performed at the bedside by emergency department personnel, revealed trace pericardial effusion and decreased ventricular contractile function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute, with new ST-segment elevations in ECG leads II, III, aVF, V3, and V4(Figure 2). Aspirin, magnesium sulfate, and insulin were administered. Twenty-six minutes later, approximately 3 hours after the patient\u2019s presentation, severe pain recurred. Fentanyl was administered intravenously. Approximately 30 minutes after the onset of this pain, light-headedness, dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea, and transient hypotension (blood pressure, 67/44 mm Hg) occurred, with a pulse of 59 beats per minute. These symptoms spontaneously improved within minutes; the systolic blood pressure rose to 92 mm Hg and subsequently ranged between 80 and 92 mm Hg, and the pulse ranged between 57 and 64 beats per minute. Vancomycin was administered. Five hours after presentation, the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. On arrival, the blood pressure was 120/55 mm Hg, and the pulse was 65 beats per minute, with an inspiratory decline in systolic pressure of less than 5 mm Hg. Breath sounds were diminished at the left base, the jugular venous pressure was 9 cm of water, and there were normal heart sounds, with no rubs or murmurs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. A repeat chest radiograph was unchanged, as compared with a radiograph obtained on admission. Electrocardiogram.An electrocardiogram, obtained on the current admission, shows sinus rhythm with 1-mm, concave ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and in leads V3and V4, along with T-wave inversions and flattening in the lateral leads. The changes in ST-segment elevations are new, as compared with the tracing obtained 10 days earlier.

On evaluation at a hospital near the patient\u2019s home in South America, transabdominal and scrotal Doppler ultrasonography (Figure 1) revealed a heterogeneous, well-circumscribed mass anterior to the right common iliac artery that had prominent internal vascularity. The testes and scrotum were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Figure 2), revealed a well-circumscribed, solid retroperitoneal mass (2.8 cm by 3.3 cm by 4.6 cm) at the level of the pelvic inlet on the right side, anterior and medial to the psoas muscle and anterior to the right common iliac artery. The mass was solitary and had homogeneous contrast enhancement. There was a 4-mm nodule at the base of the right lung that was indeterminate. Subsequent CT and18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) (Figure 3A and 3B) confirmed the presence of the well-circumscribed mass near the right psoas muscle. FDG avidity was within physiologic limits, and there was no evidence of pathologic uptake. No evidence of other pathologic conditions, upper-tract filling defects, or bladder lesions was present.

His mother had multiple sclerosis, a brother had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, his paternal grandfather had died of heart disease, and his father and other siblings and grandparents were healthy. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs, and he was not sexually active. On examination, the abdomen was soft and the mass was barely palpable; there was no regional lymphadenopathy, pain, or discomfort.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks. Four years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased. Six months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She had difficulty raising her arms above her head, and she could no longer independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands. Three months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern, and anti\u2013U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) antibodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibodies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. In the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms. The patient had a history of Graves\u2019 disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmoplegia and had been treated with methimazole for 2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroidism had developed after radioactive iodine ablation therapy. Other history included latent tuberculosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supplements, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplementation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air.

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fever, chills, myalgias, and headache developed. She also had sore throat, odynophagia, and the feeling of a \u201clump\u201d in the neck. The patient was concerned that she had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative, and she was instructed to quarantine at home. Five days before this admission, the patient returned to the clinic of the other hospital because of persistent symptoms, including daily fevers. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of another nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, as was testing of an oropharyngeal swab for the rapid detection of streptococcal antigen. On the day of admission, the patient\u2019s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and \u201cmental slowness\u201d of 2 weeks\u2019 duration. A review of systems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had immigrated to the United States two decades earlier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 160/80 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and oriented. She was unable to perform simple calculations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small nontender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients. A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, periaortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyperintensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, without corresponding restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement (Figure 1). The findings were unchanged from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation. MRI of the Head.Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images at the level of the centrum semiovale (Panel A) and at the level of the corona radiata (Panel B) show multifocal patchy hyperintensities in the cerebral white matter bilaterally (arrows). Axial T1-weighted images (Panels C and D) and axial diffusion-weighted images (Panels E and F), obtained after the intravenous administration of contrast material, show no enhancement or restricted diffusion corresponding to the white-matter hyperintensities detected on the FLAIR images. Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intravenous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclovir was stopped.

The patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein leftovers from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were followed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material during the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance. Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a complete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin. A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approximately 40 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were administered intravenously. During the next 30 minutes, tachypnea worsened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vancomycin were given. During the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsalis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approximately 110 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were administered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A continuous infusion of propofol was begun. Hypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpuric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenylephrine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was transported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital. On the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermittent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic beverages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs. The patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before admission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at 6 weeks of age. On examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2of 50%. He opened his eyes occasionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and oozing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output.

Six years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospital with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neurologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypodensity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evidence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C). MRI and CT Angiogram.Six years before the current evaluation, MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A diffusion-weighted image (Panel A) shows subtle foci of hyperintensity in the left medial cerebellum (arrow) and left lateral medulla (arrowhead). On an apparent diffusion coefficient map (Panel B), the corresponding lesions are isointense to hyperintense. On a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel C), the lesions are hyperintense (arrow and arrowhead). These findings are consistent with evolving nonacute infarcts. On the current evaluation, CT angiography of the neck was performed after the administration of contrast material. An axial image (Panel D) shows asymmetric irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the C2\u2013C3 level (arrow), a finding consistent with dissection. A maximum-intensity-projection reformation (Panel E) shows a medially directed 2-mm pseudoaneurysm (arrow) along the dissected left vertebral artery (LVA). In addition, MRI was performed before the administration of contrast material. A T1-weighted image obtained at the C2\u2013C3 level (Panel F) shows a curvilinear mural hematoma with intrinsic hyperintensity (arrow) along the dissection site. The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclovir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit scheduled in the neurology clinic. One month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed expected evolution of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow. Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral artery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test. The patient received follow-up care at another hospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsating and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position. The patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetaminophen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self-employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family history was notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia in both of his parents, as well as early-onset dementia in his father. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests. Urinalysis was also normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

CT angiography of the head and neck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 (upper cervical) segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2\u2013C3 level (Figure 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnormality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection (Figure 1F). The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinalysis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis.CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the administration of contrast material. An axial image (Panel A) shows a curvilinear filling defect within the right renal artery (arrow), a finding consistent with dissection.

At that time, she also noted a rash on her abdomen, chest, and right arm; the lesions were small, red, flat, nonpruritic, and nonpainful. She described these symptoms to her father, a physician, who advised her to go to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported that the nausea had resolved and that mild neck stiffness had developed. She had had bacterial meningitis at 9 years of age, with symptoms similar to those of the current illness. She had no history of otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, or skin infections. She had a remote history of hospitalization after a motor vehicle accident. Ten months before the current illness, she had had an episode of nephrolithiasis with spontaneous passage of a renal stone. She also had a history of anxiety. Her medications were citalopram and a combined estrogen\u2013progestin oral contraceptive. Immunizations were up to date and reportedly included vaccination againstNeisseria meningitidis. She had no known allergies. She lived alone, worked as a lawyer, and had not recently traveled outside New England or had exposure to sick persons. She had a new boyfriend but was not currently sexually active. She did not smoke or use illicit drugs, and she rarely consumed alcohol. Her parents lived nearby; she had had contact with their two dogs but had not had any recent tick bites, mosquito bites, or exposure to other animals. There was no family history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She had scattered petechiae on the chest, abdomen, and thighs and a purpuric lesion on the right shoulder that was tender on palpation without crepitus (Figure 1). The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red-cell indexes, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, lactic acid level, and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lipase; other test results are shown inTable 1. Tests for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Urinalysis revealed yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with trace ketones and 1+ bilirubin, occult blood, albumin, and urobilinogen by dipstick; there were 3 to 5 white cells and 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field, with 1+ bacteria, transitional cells, renal tubular cells, squamous cells, amorphous crystals, and mucin. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Lorazepam was administered and a lumbar puncture was performed, after which ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone were administered intravenously. Results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown inTable 1. Photographs of the Abdomen and Shoulder.On admission, there were scattered petechiae on the patient\u2019s abdomen (Panel A), chest, and thighs. A tender purpuric lesion was present on the right shoulder (Panel B). Laboratory Data. Within 90 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the emergency department, the temperature rose to 39.0\u00b0C and the pulse increased to 122 beats per minute. Over the next 3 hours, additional petechiae were noted on her trunk, arms, and legs. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, metoclopramide, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, and sodium phosphate were administered. Additional laboratory tests were performed; the activated partial-thromboplastin time and levels of fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, and thed-dimer level was 785 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The patient was admitted to the hospital. During the first hospital day, the patient continued to have a headache and was noted to have mild nuchal rigidity, but her fever and tachycardia resolved and her myalgias decreased; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Additional laboratory tests were performed; test results are shown inTable 1. Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone were continued.

One week before admission, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nonproductive cough developed. The patient felt feverish but did not measure her temperature at home. No family members or recent contacts had been ill. Two days before admission, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. One day before admission, the patient asked her daughter repetitive questions and appeared to not recognize family members. On the day of admission, the patient reported global weakness and was brought by her daughter to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported no headache, changes in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. She had a history of rheumatic heart disease, with mitral-valve stenosis and regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 60%. Other medical history included osteoporosis, compression fracture of thoracic vertebrae, and chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 ml per minute per 1.73 m2of body-surface area (reference range, >60) according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Fifteen years earlier, she had undergone open mitral-valve commissurotomy and ring annuloplasty, procedures that were complicated by the development of recurrent severe mitral-valve regurgitation, which led to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis, and severe tricuspid-valve regurgitation. Nine years earlier, she had undergone bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement and tricuspid-valve reconstruction with annuloplasty, with placement of a permanent pacemaker for persistent atrial fibrillation with bradycardia. Eight years earlier, transthoracic echocardiography had revealed a well-seated prosthetic mitral valve, an annular ring in the tricuspid position, mild tricuspid-valve regurgitation, and normal right ventricular size and function. In addition, 10 years earlier, a cholecystectomy had been performed. The patient lived at home with one of her grown children, was independent in activities of daily living, and walked for 30 minutes daily. Medications included furosemide, spironolactone, metoprolol, digoxin, and warfarin. She took her daily medications from a pillbox organizer that her daughter filled on a weekly basis. Warfarin therapy was monitored monthly with measurement of the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio; almost all results had been in the therapeutic range. The patient was born in Uganda but had moved to New England when she was 64 years of age to live with her children. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 153/60 mm Hg, the pulse 64 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 39.2 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.7. The patient was cachectic and appeared ill. She was awake but lethargic, and she responded to questions with nonsensical answers in her native language. She intermittently followed simple one-step commands and could move her arms and legs. Results of cranial-nerve examinations were normal (although the function of the first cranial nerve was not tested). The mucous membranes were dry. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender on palpation. The cardiac rhythm was irregularly irregular, with a loud S2heart sound and a systolic murmur throughout the precordium; the jugular vein was nondistended. Crackles were present in the lower lung fields. There was no leg edema. The complete blood count was normal, as were results of liver-function tests and blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and lipase. Urinalysis was normal, except for the presence of 1+ ketones (reference range, negative). Nucleic acid testing of a nasal-swab specimen for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

Chest radiography (Figure 1) revealed wires associated with median sternotomy, a single-lead pacemaker on the left side of the heart, and evidence of mitral-valve and tricuspid-valve repairs. There was evidence of stable, massive, global cardiomegaly and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominent ventricles and sulci, as well as nonspecific, scattered periventricular white-matter hypodensities; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, large territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion. Chest Radiographs.Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) show evidence of marked cardiomegaly, with a cardiothoracic ratio of more than 80%, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema.

When the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation. Several months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking. Six days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were obtained. An ECG (Figure 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Figure 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation. Cardiac Studies.An electrocardiogram (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, and right ventricular hypertrophy, as evidenced by right axis deviation and an increased R\u2032-wave amplitude in lead V1. Echocardiographic images obtained in a parasternal short-axis view (Panel B) and in an apical four-chamber view with color Doppler (Panel C) both show enlargement of the right ventricle (RV); LV denotes left ventricle. There is also flattening of the interventricular septum during systole, a finding that suggests elevated pressures in the right side of the heart (Panel B). There is moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (Panel C, asterisk); on the basis of the tricuspid regurgitation velocity, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 84 mm Hg. Echocardiographic images obtained in other views (not shown) confirmed the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A frontal chest radiograph (Figure 2A) showed enlarged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant. Imaging Studies of the Chest.A frontal chest radiograph (Panel A) shows enlarged hila (arrows). A focal area of coarse calcification is seen over the right upper quadrant (arrowhead). Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the chest (Panels B and C) show enlargement of the right ventricle (Panel B, arrow) and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery and its right (R) and left (L) main branches (Panel C, arrowheads). The calcified mass is partially seen within the hepatic dome (Panel B, arrowhead). The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell differential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting was identified.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Figure 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material and in accordance with a pulmonary embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary artery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular septal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcification was seen in the right lobe of the liver. The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the follow-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdominal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash. The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medications but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability characterized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calming and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phosphatidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school. The patient was a student at a local college. During the current school year, he had been exercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exercise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his maternal aunt. His two siblings were healthy. On examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was 79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2heart sound was accentuated, and a grade 3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left sternal border. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis. An ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy.

One year before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of pancreatitis at another hospital after magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) performed for the evaluation of chronic abdominal pain revealed pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic fat stranding involving the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Blood levels of triglycerides and IgG subclasses were reportedly normal, and the patient had not been drinking alcohol; the pancreatitis was attributed to bevacizumab, which had been administered for the treatment of neurofibromatosis. Bevacizumab therapy was stopped for 2 months. After bevacizumab therapy was restarted, elevated blood lipase levels recurred without any abdominal symptoms, and bevacizumab therapy was discontinued. Seven months before the current presentation, another MRCP showed pancreatic ductal dilatation and a pancreatic pseudocyst with internal calcification. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient was advised to continue to avoid alcohol and fatty foods. Blood lipase levels returned to normal. Three and half months before the current presentation, pain in the ankles developed. The patient reported that the pain was worse after prolonged rest and that his ankles felt stiff for 1 hour after he awoke in the morning. Two weeks later, pain, redness, and swelling in the left lower leg developed, with a central fluctuant nodule on an erythematous base (Figure 1A). Over the next 2 weeks, swelling and redness of the left fifth toe and the right first metacarpophalangeal joint developed (Figure 1B and 1C). The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. Range of motion was limited in the ankles, which had overlying soft-tissue swelling and tenderness on palpation. There was also erythema, tenderness, and soft-tissue swelling of the right fourth metacarpophalangeal joint, the left second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, and the right fourth proximal interphalangeal joint of the hand. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 76 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15), and the C-reactive protein level was 102 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8). Blood levels of calcium, uric acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme, rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide, streptolysin, and DNase were normal; tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A chest radiograph was normal. Empirical treatment with cephalexin was administered. Clinical Photographs.Three months before the current presentation, the patient presented with erythema and swelling in the left lower leg, with a central fluctuant nodule on an erythematous base (Panel A). Ten weeks before the current presentation, erythema and swelling of the left fifth toe (Panel B) and right first metacarpophalangeal joint (Panel C) developed. During the current evaluation, blanching, erythematous, indurated plaques on the medial aspect of the right knee (Panel D) and the lateral left calf (Panel E) were seen. After several days, the patient\u2019s condition had not improved, and he was evaluated by a rheumatologist. He received a diagnosis of possible L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome, and prednisone was prescribed. Over the next 2 weeks, there was a decrease in the swelling and pain in the left fifth toe and right first metacarpophalangeal joint but not in the ankle pain or the skin lesion in the left leg. Pain in the ankles worsened, was minimally alleviated with the administration of oxycodone, and limited the patient\u2019s ability to walk. The dose of prednisone was increased, and colchicine was administered, with a decrease in the ankle pain and resolution of the skin lesion in the left leg. Five weeks before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a second hospital with septic and hemorrhagic shock in the context of infected pancreatic necrosis and bleeding from a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple peripancreatic fluid collections and irregularity of the branch vessels of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, including the gastroduodenal artery, adjacent to areas of pancreatic necrosis and inflammation (Figure 2A and 2B). CT Scans of the Abdomen.Axial images obtained 5 weeks before the current presentation (Panels A and B) show extensive pancreatic necrosis and multiple large peripancreatic fluid collections (Panel A, white arrows), with a percutaneous drainage catheter placed in the dominant collection (Panel A, dashed arrow). Vessel irregularity and probable pseudoaneurysm involving the gastroduodenal artery (Panel B, arrowhead) are adjacent to areas of pancreatic necrosis. An axial image obtained on the current presentation (Panel C) shows a slight decrease in the size of necrotic peripancreatic fluid collections (white arrows), with a percutaneous drainage catheter in place (dashed arrow). Percutaneous drainage of the pancreatic necrosis and angioembolization of the gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm were performed. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. At this hospital, five intraabdominal drainage catheters were placed, with a decrease in the size of the multifocal fluid collections in the abdomen. Cultures of intraabdominal fluid grewPantoea agglomerans(formerlyEnterobacter agglomerans), abiotrophia species (formerly nutritionally variant streptococci), and lactobacillus species. The patient completed a course of piperacillin in combination with tazobactam and was discharged from this hospital to a rehabilitation facility on the 24th hospital day. Seven days after discharge, periumbilical and right lower abdominal pain developed, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. There was no fever, nausea, vomiting, or joint pain. He reported 5 days of painful skin lesions and swelling of the right leg. Other medical history included hypertension, neurofibromatosis type 2, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sensorineural hearing loss, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and anxiety. There was no history of sinusitis, inflammatory eye disease, neuropathy, or testicular disease. Neurofibromatosis had been complicated by cervical spine ependymoma, meningiomas, and vestibular schwannomas and had been treated with bevacizumab for 8 months before the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Medications included aspirin, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide, lorazepam, losartan, metoprolol, omeprazole, oxycodone, pancrelipase, prednisone, tamsulosin, and tolterodine. There was a history of heavy alcohol use, but the patient had stopped drinking alcohol 3 years before this presentation. There was a remote history of tobacco use and no history of illicit drug use. He lived with his mother in a suburb of Boston. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 107/68 mm Hg, the pulse 118 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 73.6 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with five percutaneous drainage catheters in place. There was pitting edema in the right foot. A blanching, erythematous, indurated plaque (5 cm in diameter) with superficial scale was present on the medial aspect of the right knee (Figure 1D); a similar lesion (1 cm in diameter) was present on the superior aspect of the right knee. There were two blanching, erythematous, thin plaques (1 cm in diameter) on the left lateral calf (Figure 1E). There were several nontender, hyperpigmented patches on the lower legs that were consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. There was pain on palpation and diffuse erythema and warmth of the right lower calf. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 weeks before admission to this hospital, when she underwent elective termination of pregnancy with methotrexate. The pregnancy had occurred despite the presence of an intrauterine device, and the device was removed a few days after the termination. Oral contraception was initiated. Three weeks later and 1 week before admission to this hospital, pain in the left upper quadrant, vaginal bleeding, and headache developed. The patient was admitted to another hospital. The blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin was 24 IU per liter (normal range, <6 IU per liter); the level had been 21,000 IU per liter 3 weeks earlier, when she was pregnant. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, amylase, lipase, total protein, and albumin were normal, as were results of renal-function tests, the prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio, and the partial-thromboplastin time. An examination of a peripheral-blood smear for babesia and a direct antiglobulin test were negative; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Imaging studies were obtained. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension; normal range, \u226412 cm), as well as a central filling defect in the splenic vein that was compatible with acute splenic-vein thrombosis. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed low lung volumes, scattered ground-glass opacities, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. CT Scan of the Abdomen.A coronal reconstruction of a CT scan of the abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension), as well as a central filling defect (arrow) in the splenic vein that is compatible with acute splenic-vein thrombosis. Oral contraception was stopped. On the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s abdominal pain diminished, and she was discharged home. Four days later, severe bifrontal headache and loss of vision in the left visual field developed. The patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, she had decreased peripheral vision superiorly and inferiorly in the left visual field. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was scheduled, but the severity of her headaches increased, and she was evaluated at the other hospital. Additional imaging studies were obtained. CT of the head and neck (Figure 2) revealed a confluent area of hypodensity and sulcal effacement involving the superior right parietal lobe that extended inferiorly into the right occipital lobe and the right aspect of the splenium of the corpus callosum (a finding suggestive of a recent infarct) and small, focal areas of hyperdensity (findings consistent with hemorrhagic conversion). Although a focal occlusive thrombus was not identified, the distal branches of the right posterior cerebral veins were not visible. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital. Imaging Studies of the Head.A CT scan of the head (Panel A), obtained before the administration of contrast material, shows an area of hypodensity and sulcal effacement involving the right parietal lobe that extends into the right aspect of the splenium of the corpus callosum, a finding suggestive of edema and a recent infarct. Also shown are small, focal areas of hyperdensity, findings consistent with hemorrhagic conversion. A CT venogram (Panel B), obtained in frontal projection after the administration of contrast material, shows no evidence of filling in at least one right cortical vein that drains into the superior sagittal sinus. MRI of the head was performed, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion-weighted, and gradient-echo images (Panels C, D, and E, respectively) show evidence of edema, ischemia, and hemorrhage involving the right parietal lobe. A transfemoral cerebral angiogram (Panel F), obtained in lateral projection during the venous phase after the administration of contrast material in the right internal carotid artery, shows multiple filling defects in cerebral veins (arrows), findings that indicate thrombosis of the right frontal and parietal cortical veins, with no involvement of the major dural sinuses. On evaluation in the emergency department, the patient reported persistent headache, vision changes in the left visual field, photophobia, phonophobia, and pain with extraocular movements. She had a history of chronic back pain that was related to a vertebral disk herniation, for which she had undergone spinal-fusion surgery 4 years before admission to this hospital. During the 3 years before admission, she had had two episodes of self-limited thrombocytopenia that were thought to be associated with methotrexate treatment for an unknown skin disorder. She had no history of bleeding or clotting disorders and had had no spontaneous miscarriages. She had a 2-year history of waxing-and-waning dull epigastric pain that was associated with nausea and occasional episodes of bilious emesis; the pain partially improved with omeprazole. The patient\u2019s medications included diclofenac, baclofen, controlled-release morphine sulfate, hydrocodone\u2013acetaminophen, and omeprazole. She had taken oral contraception in the past for extended periods of time. She lived in coastal New England and worked in communications. She drank alcohol occasionally and smoked less than 1 pack of cigarettes per week; she had not smoked during the past few months. She did not use illicit drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal medications. There was no family history of bleeding or clotting disorders, spontaneous miscarriage, or hematologic cancer. On examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the pulse 54 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was in mild distress because of her headache, but she was alert and oriented to time and place. Examination of the neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, and oral mucosa was normal. Left homonymous hemianopia was present; other cranial-nerve functions were normal, although function of the first cranial nerve was not tested. Strength, sensation to light touch, and deep-tendon reflexes of the arms and legs were normal. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing showed no dysmetria. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear showed 0 to 2 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop and pencil cells, occasional large platelets, and normal-appearing white cells. Urinalysis showed 1+ ketones, 2+ blood, 1+ protein, 1+ urobilinogen, a specific gravity greater than 1.040 (normal range, 1.001 to 1.035), and a pH of 5 (normal range, 5 to 9) by dipstick; microscopic examination of the sediment revealed no red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (normal range, 0 to 2). Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of this hospital, and additional imaging studies were obtained. MRI of the head confirmed the infarcts and hemorrhagic conversion that had been seen on CT angiography and venography (Figure 2). A cortical vein was not visible over the lesion, which suggested either cortical-vein thrombosis or secondary compression due to mass effect of the parenchymal lesion. On the second hospital day, transfemoral cerebral angiography (Figure 2) showed multiple cerebral venous thromboses involving the right frontal and parietal cortical veins, with no involvement of the major dural sinuses.

The patient had been well until several months before the current admission, when she began feeling vaguely ill. Approximately 10 days before this admission, a severe throbbing headache developed that was different from her usual headaches. During the following week, her family noticed inattentiveness and slowing of her thinking and speech; she noted mild weakness on the left side, a tendency to veer to the left while walking or driving, and worsening depression. Two days before this admission, evaluation by her physician revealed anemia. She was referred to another hospital. On examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was 142/82 mm Hg; the other vital signs were normal. Her speech was slow but otherwise clear and fluent, and her affect was flat. There was mild weakness of the left arm and leg and a mild pronator drift of the left arm. Plantar reflexes were flexor. Her gait was wide-based, and ambulation was slow, without apparent listing to the left. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. The platelet count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, vitamin B12, and folate and results of coagulation and liver- and renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and the hematocrit increased to 31.1%. Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Figure 1A) revealed an intrinsically hyperdense mass (3.7 cm by 2.6 cm by 3.0 cm) in the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe and adjacent corpus callosum, with associated edema in the surrounding white matter and mild midline shift to the left; the ventricles were normal in size. Intravenous dexamethasone (4 mg every 6 hours) was administered for 1 day. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed a large, enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe and corpus callosum, with extensive vasogenic edema in the right frontoparietal white matter and mild midline shift to the left. On the third day, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no evidence of a primary cancer. CT of the chest was normal. The blood level of carcinoembryonic antigen was normal. The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. Imaging Studies Obtained at Diagnosis.A CT scan of the head (Panel A), obtained without the administration of contrast material, shows an intrinsically hyperdense mass in the medial aspect of the right frontal lobe and adjacent anterior corpus callosum, with a moderate amount of edema in the right frontal white matter and mild midline shift to the left. Axial and coronal T1-weighted MRI images (Panels B and C, respectively), obtained after the administration of gadolinium, show abnormal enhancement in the body and genu of the corpus callosum (greater on the right side than on the left), extending into the septum pellucidum and left anterior caudate region (Panel C, arrow). An axial T2-weighted image (Panel D) shows that the mass has a moderate amount of associated edema in the right frontal white matter. A susceptibility-weighted image (Panel E) shows no intratumoral signal abnormalities. An apparent-diffusion-coefficient image (Panel F) shows abnormal restricted diffusion in the mass, a finding suggestive of high tumoral cell density. A corrected map of cerebral blood volume (Panel G) shows mild-to-moderate elevation of the relative cerebral blood volume in the mass. A combined positron-emission tomography and CT scan (Panel H) shows intense18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the mass. The patient reported no diplopia, dysarthria, vertigo, dysphagia, numbness or tingling, bowel or bladder incontinence, aphasia, seizure or loss of consciousness, fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, abdominal or urinary symptoms, weight changes, cough, or chest, back, or neck pain. She had hypertension, depression, dysmenorrhea, menometrorrhagia with uterine fibroids, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and she had had an ankle fracture after a fall. Medications at home included enalapril and fluoxetine, and medications on transfer to this hospital included lorazepam, as needed, for anxiety. She had no known allergies. She lived with her husband and one of her three adult children and did not work outside the home. She had smoked cigarettes (less than 1 pack per week) until 1 week before admission; she drank wine occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. Her father and aunt had lymphoma (the aunt reportedly had involvement of the central nervous system [CNS]), her mother had hyperlipidemia, a sister had thyroid cancer, and a brother had hypertension. On examination, the vital signs were normal, as was the oxygen saturation while the patient was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric. There was mild weakness of the left arm and leg (with strength rated at 4 to 4+ on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating normal strength), as well as orbiting (circling of the right arm around the left on a forearm rolling test), slowed movements, and mild pronator drift of the left arm. Reflexes were brisk and symmetric, and Hoffman\u2019s reflex was elicited. Finger-to-nose coordination was imprecise on the left side; the gait was wide-based, tentative, and unsteady, and there was decreased elevation of the left foot when the patient marched in place. Tandem, heel, and toe walking were not tested because of obvious weakness. The remainder of the physical and neurologic examinations was normal. The platelet count, lipid profile, and plasma osmolality were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, vitamin B12, folate, CA 19-9, CA-125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyrotropin and results of coagulation and renal- and liver-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed white cells and 1+ albumin, with 3 to 5 red cells, 10 to 20 white cells, few bacteria, few squamous cells, and mucin per high-power field. Urine osmolality was 971 mOsm per kilogram of water. A chest radiograph was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 53 beats per minute and was otherwise normal. On the second day, transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal right and left ventricular function, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 67%, trace regurgitation of the mitral valve, and trace insufficiency of the aortic, pulmonary, and tricuspid valves. MRI of the head (Figure 1B through 1G), performed after the administration of gadolinium, revealed a homogeneously enhancing mass (2.6 cm by 4.5 cm by 2.5 cm) that was centered in the right cingulate gyrus and body of the corpus callosum. On T2-weighted imaging, the mass had a predominantly intermediate signal, homogeneous internal enhancement, and abnormal restricted diffusion that was suggestive of hypercellularity. The enhancement and restricted diffusion extended into the caudate heads bilaterally, as well as into the septum pellucidum, left fornix, left aspect of the anterior commissure, and right genu of the corpus callosum. There was extensive vasogenic edema in the right frontoparietal white matter, with approximately 8 mm of midline shift to the left. There was no evidence of abnormal leptomeningeal or spinal cord enhancement in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. On the third day, combined positron-emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) revealed substantial18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the enhancing mass in the region of the corpus callosum but no abnormal FDG uptake in the rest of the body.

On awakening the next morning, the left side of her face was numb from lower eyelid to mouth and from nose to ear. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or other intracranial abnormalities. The patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, numbness persisted in the middle of the face; evaluations by her primary care provider, a neurologist, and a dentist did not reveal any abnormalities. Two weeks after the onset of symptoms, the numbness resolved, but ptosis of the left upper eyelid developed, along with double vision that was characterized by one image appearing diagonally over the other. The patient presented to a second hospital, where CT and CT angiography of the head and neck revealed mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses and the left sphenoid sinus, as well as air\u2013liquid levels in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. A complete blood count, white-cell differential count, and metabolic panel were normal, and a pregnancy test was negative. A 2-week course of an unspecified antibiotic agent was administered. Several days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of gadolinium, reportedly revealed changes consistent with sinusitis but was otherwise normal. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, and an ophthalmologist prescribed an eye patch to treat diplopia. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid that was obtained during a lumbar puncture (including nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus) and blood cultures were reportedly negative. Two weeks before admission, periorbital pain on the medial left side developed, without pressure, headache, or double vision. One week later, diplopia recurred, with associated abnormal deviation of the left eye. Results of studies of visual evoked potential were nondiagnostic. In the left eye, visual acuity was decreased and color discrimination was abnormal. Three days before admission, the patient had nausea and vomiting, along with vertigo that resulted in her falling in her bathroom. Diplopia persisted, and she rated left periorbital pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The evening before admission, repeat MRI was performed at the second hospital. MRI of the head revealed abnormal soft tissue along the anterior and lateral walls of the left sphenoid sinus, in the left orbital apex, and extending posteriorly into the left cavernous sinus. This soft tissue was intermediate in intensity on both a T2-weighted image (Figure 1A) and a contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (Figure 1B). A coronal contrast-enhanced MRI image (Figure 1C) showed abnormal enhancement at the junction of the cavernous sinus and Meckel\u2019s cave on the left side, with enhancing tissue extending to the inner aspect of the foramen ovale. Imaging Studies of the Sinuses and Orbits.MRI of the orbit was performed at another hospital. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) and an axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (Panel B) show tissue of intermediate intensity lining the sphenoid sinus and involving the left orbital apex and the cavernous sinus (arrows). A coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (Panel C) shows enhancing soft tissue that extends inferiorly to the foramen ovale. An axial CT image of the orbit (Panel D) shows that the bone between the sphenoid sinus and the orbital apex is relatively intact despite the presence of abnormal soft tissue on both sides (arrow). On the basis of the results of MRI, the patient was advised to go immediately to the emergency department of this hospital. On arrival, she reported that ibuprofen provided minimal relief of periorbital pain. She had no history of fever, night sweats, chest pain, dysuria, diarrhea, rashes, muscle or joint aches, or weight loss. She had hypothyroidism, chronic rhinosinusitis, and environmental allergies to mold and dust; she had had herpes zoster involving the trigeminal nerve that had resolved and had undergone excision of a breast fibroadenoma in the past. Medications included levothyroxine, aspirin, a calcium supplement with vitamin D, and ibuprofen for pain. She had no known allergies to medications. She lived with her husband and children and worked from her home. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. Her maternal grandfather had had lymphoma; other family history was not known. On examination, the temperature was 37.4\u00b0C; the other vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive, with a left afferent pupillary defect. Results of color-vision testing with Ishihara color plates were normal on the right side (8/8 correctly identified) and 0/8 on the left. Intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg on the right side and 11 mm Hg on the left. Slit-lamp examination revealed normal anterior segments bilaterally. Examination of extraocular motility revealed full motility in the right eye; the left eye had limited adduction, supraduction, and infraduction and no abduction, with minimal intorsion on attempted abduction (Figure 2). Trace ptosis of the left upper eyelid was present, and margin reflex distances were 4.5 mm in the right eye and 3.5 mm in the left. Levator function was normal, at 15 mm bilaterally. Exophthalmometry measurements were 16 mm in the right eye and 18 mm in the left, with a base of 92 mm. There was mildly reduced sensation in response to pinprick in the second branch of the fifth cranial nerve on the left side, and facial strength was normal. Results of funduscopic examination were unremarkable bilaterally; the optic nerves were normal, without pallor, edema, or hemorrhages. Results of visual-field testing, which was performed reliably on each eye, were normal on the right side; the left side had a large central scotoma, with preservation of the peripheral vision. Endoscopic endonasal examination revealed that the turbinates were moderately hypertrophied; a left septal bone spur and mild-to-moderate septal deviation were present. The remainder of the otolaryngologic, neurologic, and general examinations was normal. Photographs of the Patient\u2019s Eyes.In primary gaze (Panel C), there is mild ptosis of the left upper eyelid. The left eye has mild deficits of elevation (Panel A), adduction (Panel B), and depression (Panel E), and no abduction (Panel D). The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, white-cell count, differential count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, glucose, C-reactive protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and results of renal-function and coagulation tests. Testing for human chorionic gonadotropin in blood and urine was negative. Serum testing was positive for anti-Ro antibodies (optical density units, 63.37; reference range, 0 to 19.99) and antinuclear antibodies (at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions, in a homogeneous pattern); testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (anti-PR3 and anti-MPO), anti-La antibodies, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies was negative. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones, trace occult blood, and protein by dipstick, with 0 to 2 red cells, very few renal tubular cells, and few squamous cells per high-power field and mucin per low-power field. The patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second day, a lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 17.5 cm of water. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed very few mononuclear cells and no white or red cells. Levels of glucose, total protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal; testing for very-low-density lipoprotein was negative. Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms, electrophoresis revealed no oligoclonal bands, and cytologic examination revealed no malignant cells. A chest radiograph showed clear lungs and no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. On the third day, CT of the orbits was performed. CT of the orbits (Figure 1D) revealed that the bone between the abnormal soft tissue in the left sphenoid sinus and the abnormal soft tissue in the left orbital apex is largely intact.

liver function. The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 3 days before presentation, when epigastric distress and ankle edema occurred. He also reported increased personal stress, difficulty sleeping, dysgeusia, and nausea. On presentation in an outpatient clinic at this hospital, he reported epigastric pain that he rated at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain) and no weight loss. He had a history of asthma, pain and effusion of the right knee associated with a Baker's cyst, occasional swelling of the right ankle, and varicose veins. He had had normal results on colonoscopy 3 years earlier. His medications were pirbuterol by inhalation as needed for asthma and sucralfate as needed for stomach discomfort; he reported no use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. He lived with his partner and worked in an office. He consumed two or three glasses of wine per night and did not smoke or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 110/68 mm Hg, the weight 81.8 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 25.8. There was pitting edema of the ankles and superficial varicosities of both legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal, as were results of renal-function tests and blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase. Other test results are shown inTable 1and revealed a new anemia as compared with test results from 4 months earlier, which included a hematocrit of 42% and a mean corpuscular volume of 88 \u03bcm3. Review of a peripheral-blood smear revealed 1+ polychromasia and basophilic stippling (Figure 1). A diagnosis of gastroenteritis was made, with possible peptic-ulcer disease and a bleeding ulcer. Omeprazole and sucralfate were administered, tests for blood in the stool and for antibodies toHelicobacter pyloriin the blood were ordered, an upper endoscopy was scheduled, and a bland diet was recommended. The patient was instructed to follow up in 3 days, or sooner if his condition worsened. Peripheral-Blood Smear (Wright\u2013Giemsa stain).Review of a peripheral-blood smear reveals several erythrocytes with coarse basophilic stippling (Panel A, arrows), as evidenced by punctate basophilic inclusions that are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Some red cells are enlarged, with a purplish hue (arrowheads); this polychromasia reflects increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes. A few nucleated red cells (Panel B, arrow) are also present. Laboratory Data. The next day, the patient called his doctor's office to report pain in both legs and increasing dysgeusia. He reported that his stools were looser than usual, without hematochezia or melena. The following day, 2 days after presentation, he was seen by his primary care physician in an outpatient clinic at this hospital. He reported increased abdominal pain, pain in the right knee and both shoulders, and fatigue that had lasted for at least 1 week. On examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/89 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the height 177.8 cm, the weight 80.3 kg, and the BMI 25.4. The abdomen was normal, and the right knee was tender on palpation, with a mild effusion and no erythema; the remainder of the examination was normal. Stool obtained during a rectal examination was negative for occult blood. The patient scheduled a follow-up visit and returned home. That night, the patient presented to the emergency department at this hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain that was worse with eating and radiated to the left side of the chest, neck, shoulder, and back. Pain that was initially intermittent had become constant, and he had had constipation for 2 days. On examination, the blood pressure was 187/90 mm Hg; other vital signs, the oxygen saturation, and the remainder of the examination were normal. The blood level of lactic acid and results of coagulation tests were normal, and testing for antibodies toH. pyloriin the blood and for blood in the stool was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and was otherwise normal. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. Oxycodone and ondansetron were administered. The patient was advised to avoid acetaminophen and alcohol, and he went home in the early morning hours. Later that morning, the patient returned to the hospital for an outpatient visit and rated the pain at 4 out of 10. He had hypoactive bowel sounds and periumbilical fullness, with no epigastric pain on palpation. The blood level of C-reactive protein was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis C virus, antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and HIV antigen was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. The next day, upper endoscopic examination revealed a hiatal hernia, a nonobstructing Schatzki's ring at the gastroesophageal junction, and nodularity in the duodenal bulb. That evening, the abdominal pain markedly increased. The next day, 5 days after the patient's initial presentation, he returned to the outpatient clinic. He reported pain in the lower abdomen (rated at 8 out of 10), constipation that had lasted for 4 days, nausea with dry heaves, shortness of breath, and insomnia due to pain. On examination, he was tearful and writhing in discomfort. The temperature was 37.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 129/80 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The bowel sounds were hypoactive, and there was diffuse tenderness in both lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was transported to the emergency department at this hospital by wheelchair. On examination, he appeared anxious and uncomfortable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, and he had discomfort on palpation in the lower quadrants. The blood levels of calcium, total protein, albumin, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, and routine toxicologic screening of the blood was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Radiography of the abdomen revealed a dilated colon, with findings suggestive of stool in the right and transverse colon to a transition point in the proximal descending colon. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of contrast material, revealed a large amount of stool in the cecum and no evidence of obstruction.

At 8:50 a.m., the blood pressure was 110/90 mm Hg, the pulse 51 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98%, with the patient reporting chest pain rated at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute; ST-segment elevation of 2 to 3 mm in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and in leads V3through V6and of 2 mm in right-sided leads V4and V5; and ST-segment depression with T-wave inversion in leads aVL, V1, and V2. Transport to this hospital began at 8:52 a.m. Three minutes later, the patient vomited, became increasingly pale and diaphoretic, and was unresponsive to voice. Normal saline (a 500-ml bolus) was administered. An attempt at tracheal intubation was unsuccessful. However, since a gag reflex was present, a nasopharyngeal airway was inserted instead, without complication. Thereafter, the patient was noted to be breathing on his own. The ambulance arrived at the hospital at 9:04 a.m. The patient had a history of coronary artery disease with unstable angina; 12 years before admission, at another hospital, a bare-metal stent (3.0 mm by 24.0 mm) had been placed in the middle portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery at the level of bifurcation with the first diagonal artery. Seven years later, angina recurred, and a nuclear stress test was positive for anterior ischemia; repeat cardiac catheterization at the other hospital revealed obstructing lesions (95% and 60%) in the left circumflex artery, and two drug-eluting stents were placed. Medications the patient was taking before admission were unknown; in the past he had reportedly taken atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and aspirin (325 mg) daily. He had reported no allergies. The patient was divorced and lived with his girlfriend, with visits by his children. He worked in the construction and entertainment industries. Family members reported that he drank alcohol in moderation and had stopped smoking 11 years earlier. There was a family history of coronary artery disease. In the emergency department triage area, the patient was alert and oriented; the blood pressure was 110/90 mm Hg, and the pulse 70 beats per minute. Within seconds after he arrived, the pulse decreased to 36 beats per minute and the width of the QRS complexes on the cardiac monitor increased. External pacing was attempted, without mechanical capture. Seizure activity occurred briefly, and runs of ventricular tachycardia with wide ventricular complexes were seen; the blood pressure and carotid pulses could not be obtained, and the patient was unresponsive. The cardiac monitor revealed ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was begun, and the patient was moved to a resuscitation bay. The plasma level of total carbon dioxide was 19.5 mmol per liter (reference range, 23.0 to 31.9), the anion gap 17 mmol per liter (reference range, 3 to 15), the level of phosphorus 2.3 mg per deciliter (0.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]), and the level of glucose 145 mg per deciliter (8.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Blood levels of other electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of a complete blood count and tests of liver and renal function; screening for troponin I was negative. During resuscitation, the trachea was intubated. Amiodarone and lidocaine were administered intravenously and nine direct-current countershocks were administered.

The hospital is associated with Massachusetts General Hospital. Five months before admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic in South Africa for evaluation of a lesion on his left upper eyelid. On examination, violaceous, raised lesions were present on the left eyelid and right side of the chest (Figure 1A). Physical Appearance and Pathological Examination of the Chest Lesion.A photograph of the patient's skin shows violaceous, raised lesions that are representative of the lesion excised from the right side of the chest (Panel A). Pathological examination of a specimen of the patient's skin shows a malignant vasoformative tumor that is composed of a nodular spindle-cell infiltrate arranged in short, interlacing bundles, with intervening slitlike vasculature and angiomatous foci (Panel B, hematoxylin and eosin), features suggestive of Kaposi's sarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8 shows nuclear immunoreactivity in the spindle cells and confirms the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (Panel C). Pathological examination of an excisional biopsy specimen of the chest lesion showed a malignant vasoformative tumor of the dermis. The tumor was composed of a nodular spindle-cell infiltrate arranged in short, interlacing bundles, with intervening slitlike vasculature and angiomatous foci. Intratumoral hemosiderin pigment, erythrocyte extravasation, hyaline globules, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were conspicuous findings (Figure 1B). Immunohistochemical staining for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) confirmed nuclear immunoreactivity in the spindle cells (Figure 1C). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. An antibody test was positive for HIV type 1 (HIV-1), and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 330 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 500 to 2010). In preparation for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the patient completed pretreatment classes. During the next 3 months, new skin lesions appeared on the thighs. Sixteen weeks before admission, a productive cough developed. Two weeks later, a specimen of sputum was negative forMycobacterium tuberculosisby polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and culture. The CD4 T-lymphocyte count was 268 per cubic millimeter. A chest radiograph obtained 14 weeks before admission showed nodular opacities, 5 to 7 mm in diameter, in both lungs, most prominently in the middle and lower zones; there was loss of definition of the right hilum, with irregular peribronchovascular thickening and air bronchograms. No pleural effusions, hilar lymphadenopathy, or paraspinal masses were seen (Figure 2A). Chest Radiographs.A chest radiograph obtained 14 weeks before admission (Panel A) shows bilateral reticular and ill-defined micronodular opacities in the middle and lower zones, with peribronchovascular and perihilar predominance. Bilateral peribronchial cuffing is present. Partial opacification and air bronchograms are apparent in the right lower zone, and the right border of the heart is obscured, indicating pathology in the right middle lobe. In the lingular segment of the left upper lobe, there is poorly marginated opacification, and the left border of the heart is partially obscured. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions can be seen. A chest radiograph obtained on admission (Panel B) shows marked progression of the previous findings, with extensive central perihilar and peribronchovascular coalescent consolidation and irregular borders. There is a marked increase in size and profusion of the reticulonodular opacities. Eleven weeks before admission, therapy with tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz was begun. A chest radiograph at the time of the initiation of ART revealed no changes. One week later, the patient was seen in the infectious diseases clinic at the hospital for evaluation of worsening productive cough, daily fevers of 2 weeks' duration, weight loss of 2 kg, and night sweats. He reported full adherence with the ART regimen and noted no change in his skin lesions during the week he was receiving therapy. On examination, the temperature was normal. Small, violaceous lesions were noted on the left upper eyelid and thighs, with a healed surgical scar on the right side of the chest. The lungs and the remainder of the examination were normal. Additional sputum specimens were obtained; PCR testing and acid-fast bacilli staining and cultures forM. tuberculosiswere negative. The patient returned home. Symptoms persisted, and a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made. Seven weeks before admission, the administration of rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and isoniazid was begun. Worsening dyspnea, cough, malaise, anorexia, and an additional weight loss of 8 kg developed during the next 7 weeks, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. He reported increased numbers of skin lesions since his last visit, 10 weeks earlier. He had had a painless mass in the left inguinal region for the past 5 years, which he thought was a hernia caused by lifting weights. Approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of ART, the mass \u201cerupted\u201d and drained purulent material. Medications on admission included antiretroviral and antituberculous medications. The patient was born and lived in South Africa. He reported being heterosexual and monogamous with his wife. He had drunk alcohol socially until the onset of this illness; he did not smoke or use illicit drugs. His parents reportedly died of old age; his five siblings were healthy. He had no known exposure to tuberculosis. On examination, the patient appeared cachectic, with temporal wasting. The oxygen saturation ranged between 93% and 96% while he was breathing ambient air, and dyspnea developed with minimal exertion. The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, and the pulse 120 beats per minute. There were crepitations over the left middle and lower lung fields; the liver edge was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin, and the spleen tip was palpable. Violaceous skin lesions were present on the legs, arms, torso, palate, and left eyelid. There was lymphadenopathy in the cervical and axillary regions, with a draining lymph node and a groove sign (visible separation of enlarged inguinal and femoral lymph nodes by the inguinal ligament) in the left groin. The blood levels of electrolytes, bilirubin, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase were normal, as were the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal-function tests. The results of screening tests for hepatitis A and B viruses were consistent with immunity from previous exposure, and the results of screening for hepatitis C virus were negative; other results are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. A chest radiograph showed marked progression of previous radiographic findings (Figure 2B). There was extensive central perihilar and peribronchovascular confluent consolidation. Irregular nodular opacities were seen in the periphery of both lung fields, with some in the left upper lobe showing possible cavitation or air bronchograms. There were no pleural effusions. Given this constellation of radiographic findings in an immunocompromised patient with cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, the differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma\u2013associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Atypical tuberculosis andPneumocystis jiroveciiinfections could be further considerations.1\u20133 Gram's staining of a sputum specimen revealed scanty gram-positive cocci, and a culture grew normal respiratory flora; Ziehl\u2013Neelsen and auramine staining, direct fluorescence antibody testing forP. jirovecii,and a mycobacterial culture were negative. The administration of antiretroviral and antituberculous medications was continued, and doxycycline, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, prednisone, and oxygen (40%, administered through a nonrebreather face mask) were added.

Two days before this admission, increasing weakness, lethargy, chills, and diarrhea developed. The patient became less responsive to his family and increasingly irritable and confused. He stopped taking his medications. On the day of admission, his oral intake was 500 ml of liquid. His family reported that he was in an \u201calmost catatonic\u201d state; he was unable to arise from bed, had recurrent epistaxis, and reported pain in his chest and left arm. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital. The patient had been in poor health, with a recent diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin. He had a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac evaluations that had been performed over the previous decade had revealed an exudative pericardial effusion that had spontaneously resolved, as well as heart failure predominantly on the right side (left ventricular ejection fraction, 69%; pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, 61 mm Hg). A biopsy of the right side of the heart did not reveal a cause of the heart failure. The patient had had recurrent epistaxis since childhood, and it had recently worsened. Additional medical history included hyperlipidemia, pancytopenia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and headaches; there was also a possible history of an arteriovenous malformation of the brain, which had been noted on an imaging study obtained 20 years earlier but had not been confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at this hospital 7 years before this admission. He had undergone excision of a basal-cell carcinoma and an appendectomy. One month before this admission, the patient had been admitted to this hospital because of acute confusion and worsening edema. During that admission, ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant was performed. An image of the right lower lobe of the liver showed a communication between the right portal vein and the right hepatic vein, a finding consistent with a hepatic venovenous malformation with portosystemic shunting (Figure 1). Ultrasound Images of the Right Upper Quadrant.An image of the right lower lobe of the liver (Panel A) shows a communication between the right portal vein (arrow) and the right hepatic vein (arrowhead). Doppler ultrasound images show the portal vein (Panel B, arrow) and the hepatic vein (Panel C, arrow). A diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy was made. The confusion improved after the initiation of treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. On the current admission, medications included warfarin, metoprolol, simvastatin, furosemide, spironolactone, potassium chloride, lactulose, rifaximin, ferrous sulfate, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, and, owing to enrollment in a clinical trial investigating therapies for pulmonary hypertension, either sildenafil or placebo. The patient had had adverse reactions to azithromycin, lansoprazole, and metolazone. He lived with his wife and was retired from a position in higher education. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His parents had died when they were in their 70s; his father had had heart disease, and his mother had had a stroke. His mother and his daughter had a history of recurrent epistaxis and of easy bleeding. On examination, the patient was somnolent but easily roused by vocal stimulation. He was oriented and cooperative, with waxing and waning attention, and he was uncertain about why he was in the hospital. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/61 mm Hg, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and dried blood was noted around the nares. There were multiple telangiectasias on the face, lips, and torso, and there were nonblanching cherry angiomas on the chest. The heart sounds were irregularly irregular; the first and second sounds were otherwise normal. The lungs were clear bilaterally. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds were present. There was no abdominal distention, and the edge of the liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. Testing for Murphy\u2019s sign was negative. No rectal masses were detected on palpation; the stool was brown, with trace blood. There was no asterixis. The legs were dark and discolored, a finding consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. The remainder of the general and neurologic examinations was normal. Blood levels of total and direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid were normal, as were levels of vitamin B12and folate, which had been obtained 1 week earlier; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear yellow fluid, with a specific gravity of 1.020, a pH of 5.5, and trace blood; the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells and 0 to 2 red cells per high-power field, 20 to 100 hyaline casts and 0 to 2 granular casts per low-power field, and mucin. Screening of the urine for toxins was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, frequent premature ventricular contractions, ST-segment depression of at least 1 mm in leads II, III, and aVF, and downsloping ST-segment depression of 2 mm in lead V6. Laboratory Data. A radiograph of the chest showed evidence of persistent interstitial edema and focal opacities in both lower lobes; these findings could represent alveolar edema, superimposed pneumonia, or aspiration. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed with the administration of oral contrast material, revealed nonspecific pneumatosis of the ascending colon to the level of the hepatic flexure, without associated portal venous gas or other inflammatory changes. Cholelithiasis, atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and mesenteric vessels, and cardiomegaly were also present (Figure 2). CT Scan of the Abdomen.An axial image shows pneumatosis of the hepatic flexure (arrow) and atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta (arrowhead). Intravenous normal saline, vancomycin, cefepime, and oral potassium chloride were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. On his arrival in the inpatient unit, the dose of rifaximin was increased, warfarin and furosemide were discontinued, and lactulose and other outpatient medications were resumed.

During the evaluation, the patient described his mood as \u201cnot that good.\u201d He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing \u201cdepressive episode\u201d during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; however, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been increased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallucinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concentrating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma. The patient\u2019s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medications included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12and D3, as well as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with paroxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins. The patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of premature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiatric disease or substance use disorder in first-degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs. The patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and Santeria beliefs and also practiced tarot card reading; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adolescence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient immigrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He reported that he had experienced recurrent discrimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault. The patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had \u201cput a Vodou curse on me\u201d and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but \u201cthe damage cannot be undone.\u201d For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with colleagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a professional or social setting would see \u201cdiscoloration\u201d when they looked at his face. In his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current consultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to receive care from the same therapist for approximately three decades. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient\u2019s persecutory beliefs affected interpersonal relationships and led to the feeling of isolation at work. The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treatment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the frequency of nightmares but was discontinued owing to orthostatic hypotension. He had undergone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect. On examination, the patient was a well-groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye contact and speech of an appropriate rate and volume. He was oriented to time, place, and situation, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical information. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were levels of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram obtained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.

The patient had been well until 2 p.m. on the day before admission, when nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting developed. The next morning, he was seen at another hospital, where he reported increasing asthma and right-sided back pain, which he rated at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). On examination, he was in moderate distress. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 112/69 mm Hg, the pulse 125 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. The mucous membranes were dry, and he had scattered inspiratory wheezes, pallor and decreased skin turgor, and puncture wounds on his arms and hands. Laboratory-test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis was normal. Ipratropium and albuterol were given by inhalation, and famotidine, ondansetron, normal saline, metoclopramide, and methylprednisolone were administered intravenously; hydromorphone was then administered because of increasing pain. Laboratory Data. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed at the other hospital after the oral (but not intravenous) administration of contrast material, did not reveal any findings of acute disease (e.g., bowel distention or bowel-wall thickening) to explain the patient's severe pain and vomiting. The spleen appeared small, measuring 8 cm in the maximal craniocaudal dimension (normal range for adults, 12 to 14 cm), with at least two granulomas. There was also mild enlargement of the caudate lobe of the liver. Shortly after CT was performed, skin mottling and livedo developed, and additional history was obtained. Three days before presentation, the patient was bitten on his hands and forearms while bathing his dog; later that day, his wife washed the wounds with hydrogen peroxide. Levofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam were administered at the other hospital. He was transferred to this hospital, arriving approximately 23 hours after the onset of symptoms. On presentation, the patient reported malaise, shaking chills, a burning pins-and-needles sensation in his limbs, and diffuse body pain that he rated at 10 out of 10. He had had head trauma caused by a rusty nail a few days before presentation and dental extractions 1 to 2 weeks before presentation. He also had a history of asthma, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety, depression, chronic back pain, and alcohol abuse (with recent consumption of up to 18 beers daily); he had stopped drinking 3 days before admission. His medications were citalopram and omeprazole daily, alprazolam as needed for anxiety, and albuterol and a combination of budesonide and formoterol, which were administered by inhalation as needed for asthma. He was allergic to codeine, and tramadol had caused auditory hallucinations. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily (and had done so for 30 years), and he had used illicit drugs in the past. He reported no recent tick bites or exposures to other animals, sick persons, raw oysters, freshwater, or saltwater. He lived with his wife and his dog, which was fully vaccinated. He worked sporadically and had recently installed air-conditioning systems. His parents both died at 72 years of age from myocardial infarctions. On examination, the patient appeared ill, anxious, and diaphoretic. The temperature was 35.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 154/102 mm Hg, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the lower quadrants and without guarding or rebound. Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs, there was some mottling on his flanks and abdomen, and his fingers and ears were slightly blue (Figure 1). There were numerous lacerations with necrotic edges and scratch marks on his hands and forearms; the largest mark on his right forearm (3 to 4 cm in length) had a surrounding border (5 to 7 cm in diameter) with a purplish tinge and without exudate, crepitus, or bullae. Capillary refill occurred in 5 seconds. The remainder of the examination was normal, as were blood levels of glucose, direct and total bilirubin, phosphorus, globulin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, methemoglobin, and haptoglobin; other test results are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph with poor inspiratory effort showed elevation of the left hemidiaphragm that did not have an obvious cause; there was no evidence of pneumonia. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 132 beats per minute and low-voltage QRS complexes, with Q waves and ST-segment elevations (\u22642 mm) in the anterior leads. Vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, alprazolam, and 3 liters of normal saline were administered, and calcium and magnesium were given as needed. Photographs of the Hands, Flank, and Legs.On admission, the patient's fingers appeared slightly blue (Panel A), and there was mottling of the skin on his abdomen and flank (Panel B). Diffuse, purple, blanching livedo extended over his arms and legs (Panel C). During the first 3 hours after presentation, the level of pain decreased (rated at 4 out of 10); the respiratory rate ranged from 22 to 40 breaths per minute, and wheezing developed in the anterior lung fields. The rash progressed to involve the back, chest, and abdomen, with purpura that blanched in some areas. During the next 2 hours, the patient became increasingly confused, with delirium and periods of agitation. Additional test results are shown inTable 1. Etomidate and succinylcholine were administered, the trachea was intubated, and positive-pressure ventilation was begun. Penicillin, ceftazidime, doxycycline, heparin, and hydromorphone were added, vancomycin was continued, and cefepime and metronidazole were stopped. CT of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, masses, or infarction. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. Methylprednisolone was administered. Testing for antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. A frontal chest radiograph showed opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, as well as a pleural effusion on the left side (Figure 2A). Radiographs of the Chest and Forearm.A frontal chest radiograph (Panel A), obtained on the day of admission, shows interstitial opacities and bilateral hilar fullness, findings that are consistent with pulmonary edema. There is also new blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a hazy opacity in the left lower lobe that is obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, findings that are consistent with a pleural effusion. The next day, radiographs of the right hand and forearm (Panel B) were obtained that show soft-tissue reticulation, a feature that is consistent with edema. There is no soft-tissue gas. On the second day, the temperature rose to 39.6\u00b0C. Dermatologic examination revealed diffuse, symmetric, coalescing, retiform patches of purple ecchymoses and purpura involving most of the abdomen, chest, arms, legs, and face but sparing the forehead. The rash was predominantly nonblanching. Multiple discrete bite and scratch marks were present on the hands and arms; the largest was on the left forearm. The earlobes and fingers had a bluish hue, which persisted with elevation and warming, and did not have bullae, target lesions, mucosal involvement, crepitus, or exudate. Radiographs of the right hand and forearms showed soft-tissue swelling but no soft-tissue gas (Figure 2B). Noninvasive vascular studies revealed thrombosis in the right radial vein; the results were otherwise normal. The plasma ammonia level was normal, and testing for antibodies to hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and hepatitis B surface antigen was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was begun. Clindamycin, meropenem, hydromorphone, aspirin, omeprazole, ipratropium, and albuterol (by inhalation) were administered, and vancomycin and ceftazidime were stopped. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at the bedside and revealed a large wall-motion abnormality in the apical two thirds of the left and right ventricles.

Fifteen months before this presentation, at another hospital, the patient received a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the right leg and segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism in both lower lobes. Blood tests for a factor V Leiden mutation and a prothrombin gene mutation were reportedly negative, as were tests for antiphospholipid, anticardiolipin, and \u03b22-glycoprotein antibodies; the blood level of protein S was reportedly low. Treatment with warfarin was initiated. After 3 months of treatment, the patient had persistent cough and dyspnea on exertion, and repeat imaging studies were obtained. Twelve months before this presentation, computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. There was pulmonary embolism in the right lung, with occlusion of the interlobar pulmonary artery that extended into the middle and lower lobes, including segmental arteries. There was also a new focal dilatation (1.1 cm in diameter) of the pulmonary artery in the left lower lobe, as well as a new small right pleural effusion (Figure 1). CT Angiogram of the Chest.A CT angiogram of the chest was obtained 12 months before this presentation. There is an occlusive filling defect in the right interlobar pulmonary artery (Panel A, arrow), a finding consistent with a pulmonary embolus. The embolus extends into the right middle and lower lobes (Panel B, arrow). There is a focal dilatation (1.1 cm in diameter) of the pulmonary artery in the left lower lobe (Panel C, arrow). Warfarin was discontinued, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. After 6 months of treatment, additional imaging studies were obtained. Six months before this presentation, CT angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. A large pulmonary embolus occluded the distal right main pulmonary artery, and the previously identified pulmonary emboli had not resolved. The dilatation of the pulmonary artery in the left lower lobe, which contained a thrombus, had not changed. Because additional thromboembolic events had occurred while the patient was receiving apixaban, this medication was discontinued. Treatment with therapeutic subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium was initiated, after which the results of an anti\u2013factor Xa assay were reportedly within the therapeutic range. After 4 months of treatment, repeat imaging studies were obtained. Two months before this presentation, CT angiography of the chest was performed at the other hospital. The right main pulmonary artery was completely occluded by thromboembolic material. There were several areas of consolidation that most likely represented evolving infarcts, as well as a thrombosed subsegmental artery in the left lower lobe in the area of the previously identified dilatation. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%, and the atria and right ventricle were of normal size and function. A ventilation\u2013perfusion scan revealed a complete absence of perfusion to the right lung and multiple wedge-shaped perfusion defects at the left lung base. The patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. On evaluation, the patient reported weight loss of 18 kg during the previous 3 months but no fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, oral ulcers, genital ulcers, rashes, or eye pain or redness. She had no known exposures to tuberculosis. She had a history of hypothyroidism and seizure disorder. Medications included subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, levothyroxine, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. The patient reported consistent use of subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium, and the results of an anti\u2013factor Xa assay were reportedly in the therapeutic range. The patient resided in New England and had traveled to Florida during the year before this evaluation. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had diabetes; there was no family history of pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, or deep venous thrombosis. On physical examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 102/62 mm Hg in both arms, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 48 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 17.5. The patient was breathing comfortably. Both lungs were clear. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were normal. There was no clubbing or edema. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained to further evaluate the thrombus of the right main pulmonary artery. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest was performed before and after the administration of gadolinium. There was almost complete occlusion of the distal right main pulmonary artery and bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries that was consistent with thromboembolism. In the area of the occlusive thromboembolic material, there was enhancement of the wall of the main pulmonary artery, which was smooth and 2 mm in thickness (Figure 2). The main pulmonary artery was not dilated, and there was no evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. A new aneurysm (2.4 cm in diameter) of the pulmonary artery in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe contained a small amount of eccentric thromboembolic material. There were enlarging pulmonary infarcts in the right lung with a small amount of adjacent loculated pleural fluid. MRI of the Chest.T1-weighted images were obtained after the administration of gadolinium. There is a filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery that does not show enhancement (Panel A, arrow), a finding consistent with a pulmonary embolus. In this area, there is enhancement of the wall of the pulmonary artery, which is smooth and 2 mm in thickness. There is also an infarct in the periphery of the right lower lobe (Panel A, arrowhead). There is a new aneurysm (2.4 cm in diameter) of the pulmonary artery in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe (Panel B, arrow) that contains an eccentric thrombus. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, the complete blood count and differential count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal. Assays for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, as were tests for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and type 2 antibodies and type 1 p24 antigen. Blood cultures showed no growth. Screening for antitreponemal antibodies and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis were negative, as were the results of a blood test for galactomannan antigen (negative index value, <5.0). The 1,3-beta-d-glucan level was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference range, <60), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 69 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level was 106 mg per liter (reference range, <8). Venous ultrasonography of both legs showed a partially occlusive deep venous thrombus (1.0 cm in length) in the right popliteal vein.

Eighteen weeks before the current presentation, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patient\u2019s primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital. Eleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepening of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal bossing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing between the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal-sized pituitary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subsequently recommended. Seven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed, given the patient\u2019s diagnosis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloroquine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial perfusion imaging performed after the administration of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was moderately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. During intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexamethasone and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were administered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pressure gradually decreased (Figure 1A). Sixteen minutes after induction began, the blood pressure was 96/48 mm Hg and the heart rate 75 beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring (Figure 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenylephrine and an ephedrine bolus were administered. The blood pressure increased to 110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolution of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor therapies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit. Intraoperative Vital Signs.Vital signs were recorded during two separate episodes of hypotension with concurrent ST-segment elevation after the administration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the induction of anesthesia that preceded the first attempted procedure (Panel A), there was a gradual onset of hypotension over a period of 10 to 15 minutes for which the patient received doses of vasopressors that were higher than those typically used to restore normotension. During the induction of anesthesia that preceded the second attempted procedure (Panel B), there was an abrupt and profound drop in the systolic blood pressure immediately after the administration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. Dexamethasone was administered to treat possible adrenal insufficiency, and epinephrine was administered in escalating doses, followed by an infusion. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer during the first induction and through an arterial catheter during the second induction. Intraoperative Telemetric Monitoring.Intraoperative telemetric monitoring performed during the patient\u2019s hypotensive episodes shows ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF, with reciprocal depressions in leads I and aVR, during the administration of anesthetics before the first attempted procedure (Panel A) and during the administration of anesthetics before the second attempted procedure (Panel B). On admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9); 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomographic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and isosorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery disease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was determined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.

On the day of the current presentation, she was again taken to the operating room to undergo transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative blood pressure, as measured through an arterial catheter, was 118/67 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when she awoke from sleep with swelling and discoloration of the skin of the left arm above the elbow. There was no history of trauma to the arm. Over the next 2 days, the swelling and discoloration spread to the elbow and forearm and pain developed. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 153/65 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. Ecchymosis extended from above the left elbow to the left wrist, and there was pain with palpation of the left forearm. The radial pulse was normal, as was range of motion in the left elbow and wrist. Radiographs of the left forearm showed diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes of the wrist joint, without fractures or bone lesions. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Ibuprofen was administered, and the patient was given a shoulder sling for comfort and discharged home.

Over the next 2 days, the pain in the left arm worsened and the ecchymosis spread to the left hand and digits. The pain did not abate with the use of ice packs or acetaminophen or with elevation of the arm. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was widowed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.3. There was discoloration of the left arm with sharp demarcation in the middle of the upper arm, proximal to the elbow, and uniform extension to the metacarpophalangeal joints (Figure 1). There was tenderness with palpation of the forearm and dorsal wrist, passive range of motion of the wrist and elbow, and diffuse swelling and mild firmness of the forearm, without induration. Sensation to light touch was intact throughout the arm and hand. The radial pulse was normal, and the fingers were warm, with brisk capillary refill in all the digits. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Clinical Photograph of the Left Arm.A photograph of the patient\u2019s left arm obtained on the day of admission to this hospital shows discoloration with sharp demarcation in the middle of the upper arm, proximal to the elbow, and uniform extension to the metacarpophalangeal joints. Computed tomography (CT) of the left arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed disproportionate enlargement of the brachioradialis muscle, a finding suggestive of intramuscular hematoma. There was hyperdense stranding in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm, a finding consistent with hemorrhage (Figure 2). CT angiography of the arteries revealed heavy, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80% stenosis (Figure 3). The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or delayed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection. In addition, an enhancing mass was not identified. The visualized superficial and deep veins were patent on delayed-phase images. CT Scan of the Left Arm.A coronal image (Panel A) shows high-density material consistent with blood products in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow (arrowhead); the lines correspond to the levels at which the images in Panels B, C, and D were obtained. Axial images obtained from the upper arm at the level of the proximal humerus (Panel B), the elbow (Panel C), and the proximal forearm (Panel D) show extension of the high-density material into the forearm (Panels C and D, arrowheads). The bulging contour of the brachioradialis, disproportionate to the adjacent musculature, is suggestive of intramuscular hematoma (Panel C, arrow). CT Angiogram of the Left Arm.Volume rendering of the aorta and arterial vasculature of the left arm (Panel A) shows multifocal calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic and abdominal aorta; the axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries are patent. Curved planar reformation of the subclavian arteries (Panel B) shows heavy, calcified atherosclerotic plaque with associated high-grade stenosis (arrow).

The patient had been well until approximately 3 years before admission, when herpes zoster infection (shingles) occurred; shortly thereafter, episodes of bloody diarrhea developed, after which a diagnosis of inflammatory colitis was made at another hospital. Two years before admission, mesalamine was administered for treatment of the colitis, with improvement of his symptoms. During the next 2 years, progressive dyspnea on exertion occurred. One year before this admission, pulmonary-function tests were performed, and diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and advanced emphysema were made. Tiotropium bromide was administered by inhalation. During the 6 months before this admission, numerous episodes of worsening dyspnea occurred. Supplemental oxygen (2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, as needed), multiple courses of antibiotics, and tapering courses of prednisone were administered, with transient improvement. Approximately 5 months before this admission, cough with sputum production developed. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, performed at the other hospital, showed moderately severe centrilobular emphysema with bilateral lower-lobe basilar opacities, which may represent mild atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. The main pulmonary artery was dilated, which can be seen in cases of pulmonary hypertension. Three months before admission to this hospital, a stress echocardiogram revealed fair-to-poor exercise capacity that was consistent with deconditioning, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%, diastolic dysfunction, and an estimated pulmonary-artery pressure of 45 mm Hg. The patient traveled to Florida for 1 month and felt relatively well on his return. Approximately 7 weeks before this admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened; supplemental oxygen (2 liters per minute through a nasal cannula) was administered. A CT image of the chest obtained according to the pulmonary-embolism protocol at the other hospital showed emphysema with bronchial-wall thickening and new tree-in-bud and small nodular and reticular opacities in the lower lobes, the right middle lobe, and the lingula. A new, irregular nodular opacity in the right lower lobe measured 1.8 cm by 1.4 cm. The findings were thought to represent aspiration or pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Approximately 3 weeks before admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened and was associated with a nonproductive cough and temperatures to 37.8\u00b0C; the patient became unable to walk short distances in his home. Prednisone, tiotropium (by inhalation), mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (in combination, by inhalation), and azithromycin were administered, without improvement. Oxygen saturation on exertion measured 75% while the patient was breathing 2 liters per minute, and supplemental oxygen was increased to 4 liters per minute through a nasal cannula, 24 hours daily. The administration of levofloxacin was begun, and 2 days later, he was admitted to the other hospital. Medications at home also included metoprolol, lisinopril, and gabapentin. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/73 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute; the oxygen saturation was 70% while the patient was breathing ambient air, and it rose to 95% with supplemental oxygen flow at 4 liters per minute. Examination of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base and diffuse wheezing in the upper lung fields. Blood levels of platelets, electrolytes, glucose, calcium, creatine kinase, and creatinine were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed occasional premature ventricular complexes. Laboratory Data. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs showed new hazy opacities in both lungs, most prominently in the right middle lobe (Figure 1A and 1B). CT of the chest was then performed, which revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities (Figure 1C and 1D), with more severe involvement of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and superior segment of left lower lobe and less severe involvement of the upper lobes. The tree-in-bud and nodular opacities noted on the previous CT scan had resolved, a finding consistent with resolved pneumonia. There was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions. No evidence of traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing was found, which would have suggested interstitial fibrosis. The heart was not enlarged. Chest Imaging.A chest radiograph shows new bilateral hazy opacities that are most predominant in the right middle lobe (Panels A and B, arrows). CT images of the chest show diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities without evidence of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions (Panel C, axial image, and Panel D, coronal image). Serologic testing, including testing for antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and rheumatoid factor, was negative. A blood test for galactomannan antigen was negative. Prednisone, gabapentin, mesalamine, ipratropium bromide by inhaler, albuterol sulfate by inhaler, and levofloxacin were administered. The patient remained afebrile and without sputum production. Two days before admission to this hospital, his respiratory status worsened. His supplemental oxygen needs increased to 80% oxygen through a face mask to maintain oxygen saturations between 85% and 90%. Prednisone was stopped, and methylprednisolone and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were administered. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, an ejection fraction of 50%, and a positive bubble study (i.e., the injection of agitated saline showed evidence of right-to-left shunting across the interatrial septum). One day before admission, cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries, a mean pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg, and a pulmonary-artery pressure of 39/20 mm Hg (mean, 28), with no evidence of left-to-right shunting. On the ninth day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. The patient had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Medications on transfer included methylprednisolone sodium succinate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, escitalopram, gabapentin, heparin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, mometasone, acetaminophen, and lorazepam; he also was receiving 80% oxygen through a face mask. He had no known allergies. He was retired, having previously worked in sales. He lived with his wife and pet dogs and cats. Before this illness, he did yard work occasionally and had no known exposures to pet birds or hay and no occupational exposures, including asbestos. He drank two alcoholic beverages daily, did not use illicit drugs, and had smoked for 50 pack-years until stopping 8 months before admission because of dyspnea. His mother had COPD, and his children and grandchildren were healthy. On examination, the temperature was normal, the blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. Breath sounds were diminished, without wheezes or crackles. Oxygen saturation was 67% on arrival, while the patient was breathing oxygen (4 liters per minute) through a nasal cannula; it rose to 89 to 90% with the administration of oxygen (10 liters per minute) through a face mask, and approximately 2.5 hours later, it increased to 93% with the use of a high-flow face mask that delivered a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60%. The remainder of the examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 91 beats per minute, with occasional premature ventricular complexes and possible premature atrial complexes with aberrant conduction.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before the current presentation, when sore throat, fever, and fatigue developed while he was visiting relatives in the Southwest region of the United States. The symptoms persisted despite regular use of acetaminophen. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital in the Southwest, where a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reportedly negative. Oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home. Ten days before the current presentation, a tongue ulcer developed, along with dry scaly nodules on the face and hands and migratory arthralgias in the wrists, fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Because of worsening symptoms, the patient returned home to Boston by airplane. When he landed in Boston, the patient felt too weak to stand, and an ambulance was called to transport him to this hospital. In the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, and sore throat. He had lost 4.5 kg over a 1-month period. He had no eye redness or pain, genital ulcers, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. There was no notable medical history, and the patient had not been taking any regular medications before this illness. He had completed a course of oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline the day before presentation, and he had been taking acetaminophen for the past month. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in China and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. He lived with his wife in Boston. He had not traveled internationally for more than 10 years. The patient had previously worked in environmental maintenance but was retired. He had no history of exposure to animals or fresh water and no sick contacts. He had not been sexually active for several years. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, and he drank alcohol socially; there was no injection-drug use. His family history included colon cancer in his father, lung cancer in his mother, pancreatic cancer in his sister, and hepatocellular carcinoma in his brother. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/69 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 59 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.2. The patient appeared unwell. There was no conjunctival injection. Oral mucous membranes were dry. There was a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. Strength was 4/5 in both shoulders. The remainder of the neurologic examination was normal. There were several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers, an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow, and two erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead (Figure 1). There were no genital lesions. Clinical Photographs.Panels A and B show several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers. Panel C shows areas of hyperkeratosis on the lateral aspect of the fingers. Panel D shows an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow. Panel E shows two dull erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead. Panel F shows a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. The ferritin level was 3089 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 20 to 300) and the creatine kinase level 505 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Urinalysis showed 2+ ketones and 1+ protein.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent reticular opacities throughout the lower lobes of the lungs (Figure 2). CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a left adrenal nodule, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. Imaging Studies.CT was performed on hospital day 1. An axial image through the lower lungs (Panel A) shows dependent reticular and ground-glass opacities. A coronal image through the mid-lungs (Panel B) shows perilobular thickening and patchy ground-glass opacities and septal thickening without honeycombing or fibrosis. MRI was performed on hospital day 6. A T2-weighted oblique image of the left shoulder (Panel C) shows patchy mild intramuscular edema that is most pronounced in the trapezius and deltoid. Repeat CT was performed on hospital day 11. An axial image through the mid-lungs and lower lungs (Panel D) shows progressive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative opacities, a finding compatible with organizing pneumonia, as well as small left and trace right pleural effusions. Coronal and sagittal images (Panels E and F, respectively) show perilobular and septal thickening and consolidation. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Intravenous fluid and oral fluconazole were administered. Biopsies of skin lesions on the left elbow and left side of the forehead were performed. During the next 5 days, the fatigue, arthralgias, skin lesions, and mouth pain continued, and daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.8\u00b0C were recorded. The mouth lesion did not abate with the use of fluconazole, which was being administered for presumptive oral candidiasis, and the agent was discontinued. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the forehead lesion revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, pigment incontinence, and sparse perivascular chronic inflammation.

Brezina(Hematology): A 60-year-old man was seen in the outpatient cancer center at this hospital because of bone pain and skeletal lesions on imaging. The patient had been well until approximately 2 months before this evaluation, when he had a gradual onset of pain in the back of his neck and shoulders, which was followed later by a sharp pain in the middle of his back that began suddenly after sneezing. The pain increased after exercise and did not decrease with physical therapy, massage therapy, or a course of prednisone. One month before this evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest that was performed at another hospital revealed numerous lytic lesions in the thoracic spine and pathologic compression fractures of T5 and T7 (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) parameters (also performed at the other hospital at that time) revealed numerous lesions with high signal intensity involving the vertebral bodies and posterior elements (Figure 2). CT Scans of the Thoracic Spine.On a sagittal reformatted image obtained 9 months before the initial presentation (Panel A), no lytic lesions are present. On an image obtained 1 month before presentation (Panel B), there are numerous lytic lesions at T5, T6, and T11 (arrows); a lytic lesion at T7 has resulted in a pathologic compression fracture and an approximately 50% loss of height (asterisk). On an image obtained 1 week before presentation (Panel C), there is an increase in the size and number of lytic lesions (arrows), progression of a previously minimal pathologic compression fracture of T5 (arrowhead), and evidence of vertebral augmentation at T7 (asterisk). MRI Scans of the Lumbar Spine.A sagittal image obtained with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) parameters 1 month before presentation (Panel A) shows numerous lesions with high signal intensity throughout the vertebral bodies and posterior elements of the lumbar spine (arrows). An image obtained with STIR parameters 2 months after the diagnosis (Panel B) shows an increase in the size and number of lesions with high signal intensity (arrows). A lesion at L1 has resulted in a pathologic compression fracture, with approximately 50% loss of height (asterisk). Nurse Practitioner Brezina:Pathological examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen that was obtained at that time reportedly revealed mildly hypocellular bone marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. Immunoperoxidase stains for CD34, CD117, CD3, CD20, and CD138 and in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda light chains showed no abnormal cells. Examination of the bone marrow aspirate revealed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and scattered mast cells, including occasional cells with an atypical spindle-shaped appearance. Flow cytometric and cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for aCHIC2deletion associated withFIP1L1\u2013PDGFRAfusion was negative. A narcotic analgesic agent was administered. The level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 2.9 ng per milliliter. One week later, a CT-guided biopsy of a lesion in the iliac crest was performed, and examination of the specimen reportedly revealed slightly hypocellular marrow and a mildly increased number of CD117+ mast cells, including spindle-shaped cells. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed at T7 for pain relief; pathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the T7 vertebra reportedly revealed necrosis, fibrosis, and bone remodeling, with prominent osteoclastic activity. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a few CD117+ mast cells in fibrotic marrow, with no definite coexpression of CD2 or CD25 cells. Ghosts of spindle-shaped cells were observed in necrotic areas. The hematocrit was 37.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 74 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15), and the blood level of tryptase 20 ng per milliliter (reference range, 2 to 10). The white-cell count and differential count were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and \u03b22-microglobulin, results of liver-function tests and serum protein electrophoresis, and the 24-hour urinary histamine level. Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was reportedly negative, as was FISH analysis for theBCR-ABLrearrangement and testing of peripheral-blood leukocytes for the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation and theKITD816V mutation. Nine days before the current evaluation,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography and CT (PET\u2013CT) revealed FDG-avid lesions throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton (Figure 3). Combination18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron-Emission Tomography and CT (PET\u2013CT) Scans.On axial PET\u2013CT images, there are FDG-avid lesions in numerous bones, including the cervical spine (Panel A, arrow), sternum and right scapula (Panel B, arrows), thoracic spine and left eighth rib (Panel C, arrows), upper lumbar spine (Panel D, arrows), lower lumbar spine and iliac bones (Panel E, arrows), and right ischium and right femoral head (Panel F, arrows). Nurse Practitioner Brezina:The day before this evaluation, the patient was seen in the allergy and immunology clinic at a second hospital. Physical examination revealed no cutaneous urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, or angioedema. Review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens and the iliac bone and vertebral-body biopsy specimens showed features that were interpreted as suspicious for but not diagnostic of systemic mastocytosis; repeat biopsy of a bone lesion and the administration of interferon-\u03b1 were recommended. The next day, the patient was seen in the cancer center at this hospital. The patient reported severe pain in the neck, back, and pelvic bone, as well as decreased appetite and a weight loss of 4.5 kg during the previous 2 months, intermittent mild heartburn, and no flushing, tachycardia, pruritus, urticaria pigmentosa, or diarrhea. Urinary retention had developed after initiation of pain medications, and he reported psychological stress and anxiety. He had a history of shingles, and until 5 years before this illness, he had had occasional episodes of syncope when standing. There was no history of gastric ulcers, bone fractures, abnormal blood counts, allergic rhinitis, heart disease, or prior surgeries. Medications included alprazolam, mirtazapine, zoledronic acid (administered once by infusion 1 week earlier), a fentanyl patch, hydromorphone, and tamsulosin (for urinary retention after the administration of pain medication). He had no known allergies. He was married and worked at a health care organization. He had a smoking history of 40 pack-years, currently smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day, and drank alcohol occasionally. His mother was over 90 years of age and had dementia, and his father had died at 84 years of age with coronary artery disease and prostate cancer; there was no family history of hematologic cancers. On examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and in pain. The vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. There was mild midepigastric tenderness on deep palpation, without rebound, and tenderness on palpation of the spine in the mid-thoracic and lumbosacral regions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hematocrit was 37.8%, the blood level of lactate dehydrogenase 251 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210), the globulin level 4.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 2.3 to 4.1), the uric acid level 3.4 mg per deciliter (202 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 3.6 to 8.5 mg per deciliter [214 to 506 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the tryptase level 23.2 ng per milliliter (reference value, <11.5); the platelet count, red-cell indexes, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, albumin, and parathyroid hormone.

At an affiliated hospital, the infant was born by cesarean section to a 30-year-old primigravida mother at 34 weeks 6 days of gestation, after late-onset oligohydramnios and premature labor occurred and a nonreassuring fetal heart-rate pattern developed. The membranes were ruptured at delivery, and the baby emerged vigorous, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The weight was 2.15 kg (34th percentile for gestational age), the head circumference 31.5 cm (54th percentile), and the length 46 cm (64th percentile). The oxygen saturation was 95% while the baby was breathing ambient air. The initial blood pressure was 40/25 mm Hg (reference range for a premature newborn, 55 to 75 systolic and 35 to 45 diastolic), with a mean arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination revealed features consistent with those of a late preterm infant. The standard dose of vitamin K was administered shortly after birth. The infant was admitted to the special-care nursery. Subsequent blood-pressure recordings reportedly revealed a systolic blood pressure between 30 and 39 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure between 10 and 19 mm Hg. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. Supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and boluses of normal saline and dextrose were administered, without improvement. Blood oozed at the site of peripheral punctures, and fresh-frozen plasma was administered. A repeat hematocrit was 29%, and packed red cells were transfused. A chest radiograph reportedly showed diffuse, nonspecific pulmonary haziness. Laboratory Data. A blood culture was performed, and ampicillin and gentamicin were administered 1 and 2 hours after birth, respectively. Approximately 7.5 hours after birth, the total serum bilirubin level was 6.4 mg per deciliter (109 \u03bcmol per liter) and the direct bilirubin level was 1.5 mg per deciliter (26 \u03bcmol per liter); phototherapy was begun. A Kleihauer\u2013Betke test (hemoglobin F stain) for fetal\u2013maternal hemorrhage (fetal blood loss across the placenta and into the maternal circulation) was positive 4 hours after birth. Fresh-frozen plasma was transfused 14 hours after birth. Blood samples were obtained on the first day of life, before the transfusions were performed, and sent to the New England Newborn Screening Program; the results were reportedly indeterminate, and a requested follow-up sample could not be definitively interpreted because blood products had been administered. Hypotension persisted. Dopamine was administered intravenously, and the blood pressure rose to 64/24 mm Hg, with a mean arterial pressure of 36 mm Hg. Anuria developed. The patient was transferred to this hospital by the neonatal transport team, arriving 16 hours after birth. The patient\u2019s mother had a history of genital herpes and had been treated during the pregnancy with valacyclovir; she had no active lesions at delivery. She had received prenatal care and was immune to rubella; tests for hepatitis B surface antigen and syphilis were negative. Her ABO blood type was O, Rh positive, and screening for antibodies to red cells was negative. Results of testing for group B streptococcus were not known. She reported no history of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit-drug use. She had emigrated from eastern Europe 12 years earlier, lived with the infant\u2019s father, and worked in an office. On examination, the infant was nondysmorphic, with pink skin, a normal cry, and normal activity. The blood pressure was 58/28 mm Hg (with a mean arterial pressure of 38 mm Hg), the pulse 168 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 to 49 breaths per minute, and the temperature 36.8\u00b0C. A harsh systolic murmur, grade 2/6, was loudest at the left lower sternal border, and there were mild respiratory retractions and coarse breath sounds. The umbilical-cord stump oozed blood; bruising was present around sites of intravenous-catheter insertion, and there was a small caf\u00e9 au lait spot on the left side of the chest. Muscle tone was slightly decreased, and the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of phosphorus and calcium were normal; other test results are shown inTable 1. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen revealed clear lungs and a normal bowel-gas pattern. Infusions of glucose and dopamine were continued; acyclovir, phytonadione (vitamin K), ampicillin, cefotaxime, and oxygen (through a nasal cannula) were administered. Cryoprecipitate (1 unit) and fresh-frozen plasma (1 unit) were transfused. Overnight, generalized edema increased, and ecchymoses and bleeding at the venipuncture sites and crackling breaths sounds developed. On the second day of life, urine output remained minimal. Results of screening for partial-thromboplastin time\u2013lupus anticoagulant were interpreted as negative. Additional laboratory test results were obtained (Table 1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a patent foramen ovale with trace left-to-right shunting, a patent ductus arteriosus (2 mm in diameter), dilatation of the ascending aorta, trace aortic insufficiency, elevated pulmonary resistance, slight right ventricular dilatation, and normal left ventricular function (estimated ejection fraction, 65%). Oxygen saturation decreased to 89 to 91%. Midazolam and fentanyl were administered, the trachea was intubated, mechanical ventilation was initiated, and a central venous catheter was placed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed without the administration of gadolinium. T2-weighted imaging showed a diffuse hypointense signal in the liver and pancreas, a moderate amount of ascites, and anasarca. The kidneys appeared to be normal. Vecuronium, vancomycin, calcium gluconate, furosemide, famotidine, vitamin E, total parenteral nutrition, and additional doses of acyclovir, cefotaxime, ampicillin, and vitamin K were administered, and infusions of glucose and dopamine were continued. Additional fresh-frozen plasma, packed red cells, platelets, and albumin were transfused. A rectal culture for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, a nasal culture for methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus, and a blood culture were negative. The next day, ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed ascites and normal kidneys; intrarenal arterial Doppler ultrasonography revealed an absence of diastolic flow, which was most likely caused by vasopressor treatment, and no evidence of renal-artery stenosis or renal-vein thrombosis. Dopamine was tapered and discontinued, and a mean arterial pressure above 40 mm Hg was maintained without the use of pressors.

The patient had a history of a pelvic kidney and had otherwise been well until approximately 2 months before this admission, in the early spring, when high fevers occurred daily for 5 days, stopped for 4 days, and then recurred for 4 to 5 days. On examination by her pediatrician, a slightly erythematous tympanic membrane was reportedly present, as were labial adhesions, which precluded collection of a urine specimen for analysis or culture. A 10-day course of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was administered for possible otitis media or urinary tract infection, and the fevers resolved on the third or fourth day of treatment. Nine days before this admission, fever (with temperatures up to 40.6\u00b0C) occurred at night, with no other localizing symptoms. The patient was seen by her pediatrician the following day. The evaluation included urinalysis and culture of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization; these tests were reportedly negative. The fever recurred during the next 4 days, despite alternating treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and then resolved. Two days before this admission, in the afternoon, the temperature rose again to 40.6\u00b0C, with associated irritability. The next day, the patient returned to the pediatrician\u2019s office. On examination, the pharynx was slightly erythematous; the remainder of the examination, including assessment of the tympanic membranes, was normal. Analysis of a urine specimen that was obtained by means of catheterization revealed 1+ blood and trace protein and ketones by dipstick. The pediatrician advised the family to take the patient to the emergency department the next day for further evaluation. The parents reported that the patient had decreased oral intake; she drank only sips of breast milk and a rehydration solution with glucose and electrolytes. She did not have a cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash. She was born after a full-term gestation. Ultrasonography that had been performed while the patient was in utero had revealed a pelvic left kidney; since birth, she had been monitored by a nephrologist. Her growth and development had been normal, and she was crawling without difficulty during this illness. Her immunizations, including the influenza vaccination, were current; she had taken no medications before this illness and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents, older siblings, and a dog and two cats. She had no exposure to tuberculosis or sick contacts and had not traveled outside the country. Her father had Graves\u2019 disease, her mother had the polycystic ovary syndrome, her sister had had a urinary tract infection, and her brother had esophageal atresia and tracheomalacia. On examination, the patient was alert, had flushed cheeks, and did not have signs of sepsis. The temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the examination was normal. The posterior oropharynx could not be visualized. Blood levels of glucose, ferritin, total protein, albumin, globulin, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed 1+ ketones and 1+ occult blood by dipstick, with 0 to 2 white cells and red cells, few bacteria, and few squamous cells per high-power field and amorphous crystals. Specimens of blood and urine, which were obtained by means of catheterization, were cultured. Screening of the nasal secretions for respiratory viruses was negative. Laboratory Data. Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Figure 1A and 1B) show mild pulmonary hyperinflation and mild interstitial opacities, without a focal air-space opacity; these findings are consistent with reactive airway disease, or bronchiolitis. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Ultrasound images of the kidneys (Figure 1C and 1D) show that the right kidney (7.2 cm in length, in the renal fossa) and the left kidney (4.7 cm in length, in the left lower quadrant) have a normal appearance. There is no evidence of pyelonephritis, perinephric-fluid collection, abscess, hydronephrosis, or bladder abnormality. Imaging Studies Obtained in the Emergency Department.Frontal and lateral chest radiographs (Panels A and B, respectively) show mild pulmonary hyperinflation and mild interstitial opacities. Ultrasound images of the abdomen and pelvis (Panels C and D, respectively) show that the right kidney has a normal appearance and location and that the left kidney, located in the pelvis, is ectopic but otherwise normal. In the emergency department, the temperature rose to 40.0\u00b0C. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Examination revealed pharyngeal injection without exudate, a palpable left inguinal lymph node (1 cm in diameter), and normal femoral pulses. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Ceftriaxone and acetaminophen were administered, and crystalloid solution was infused. A tuberculin skin test was performed. On the first hospital day, the maximum temperature was 39.2\u00b0C.

Approximately 1.5 years before the current evaluation, while the patient was in the Dominican Republic, she sought medical attention for episodic pain of the right flank, with no other symptoms. At that time, she was told she had microscopic hematuria that may be due to kidney stones, and she received a prescription for unknown oral medications. After she took the medications, the flank pain resolved, and she had no further follow-up. Two weeks before the current evaluation, bilateral back and flank pain developed. She was evaluated at a local health center. An abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a partially exophytic mass (2.8 cm by 2.6 cm by 2.5 cm) in the lower pole of the right kidney, with mixed echogenicity and internal vascularity. No hydronephrosis or renal stones were visualized, and the sizes of the kidneys were normal. The patient was referred for a consultation with a nephrologist at this hospital. On evaluation in the nephrology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported mild headache, nausea, and constipation; there was no abdominal or pelvic pain, hematuria, foamy urine, weight loss, anorexia, peripheral or facial edema, or rash. She had a history of stage 4 chronic kidney disease (with a baseline creatinine level of 1.8 mg per deciliter [159.1 \u03bcmol per liter]), diabetes mellitus type 2, systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, tinnitus, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and had undergone an appendectomy and a hysterectomy. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, atenolol, chlorthalidone, sitagliptin, and iron sulfate. The patient was from the Dominican Republic and had immigrated to the United States 1 year earlier. She had four children and was retired. She smoked two to five cigarettes daily and had done so for the past 30 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She had no family history of kidney stones, renal disease, or cancer. On examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. There were well-healed incisions in the right lower quadrant and along the midline of the abdomen. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable masses. No flank or costovertebral-angle tenderness, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or peripheral edema was present. The remainder of the examination was normal. A complete blood count and iron studies (including levels of iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin) were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, and albumin; other test results are shown inTable 1. Urinalysis revealed clear, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.008, a pH of 7.0, 1+ occult blood, 3+ albumin, 5 to 10 red cells and 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field, and no glucose, bilirubin, ketones, or nitrite. Laboratory Data. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive (at a dilution of 1:160). Tests for antibodies to double-stranded DNA, hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B core IgM antibodies, and Bence Jones protein were negative. Levels of C3, C4, and immunoglobulins were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis. Lisinopril was prescribed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys was performed without the intravenous administration of gadolinium because of impaired renal function. The images showed a complex, solid mass (measuring 3.0 cm by 2.9 cm by 2.9 cm) in the lower pole of the right kidney. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (Figure 1A and 1B), the lesion had heterogeneous signal intensity. On T1-weighted gradient-echo in-phase and out-of-phase images (Figure 1C and 1D), there was loss of signal at the posterior aspect of the lesion, a finding consistent with the presence of intravoxel fat. The mass was suspicious for renal carcinoma. MRI Scans.An axial T1-weighted image with fat saturation (Panel A) and a coronal T2-weighted image without fat saturation (Panel B) show an exophytic lesion (3.0 cm by 2.9 cm by 2.9 cm) arising from the anterior lower pole of the right kidney (arrows), with heterogeneous signal intensity. Axial T1-weighted gradient-echo in-phase and out-of-phase images (Panels C and D, respectively) show loss of signal at the posterior aspect of the lesion (arrows), a finding consistent with the presence of intravoxel fat.

On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and 1B) was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Figure 1C and 1D), the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal. Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis, Other Hospital.At the time of admission to the other hospital, coronal (Panel A) and axial (Panel B) images from CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. Surgical clips related to a previous cholecystectomy are visible (black arrow), and the common bile duct measures 7 mm in diameter, with smooth distal tapering to the ampulla (white arrowheads). Small-bowel loops of normal caliber are seen throughout the abdomen (white arrows). There is mesenteric edema (black arrowhead) and anasarca (not shown). One day after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel C) and axial (Panel D) T2-weighted images from magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. The common bile duct again measures 7 mm in diameter (arrowheads), without choledocholithiasis. A 1.9-cm simple cyst is seen in the left kidney (arrow). Eight days after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel E) and axial (Panel F) images from CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. There are new dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that are not seen on the initial CT scan; the loops measure up to 4 cm in diameter, with an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant (arrows). After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domestic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient\u2019s discharge to an assisted-living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospital day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained. Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1E and 1F), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels and an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant. Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1), and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient\u2019s overall health, the patient\u2019s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been having difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her surgical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included pantoprazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline \u2014 all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sister in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have contact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipolar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. On examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachectic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangential, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional laboratory test results are shown inTable 1.

The patient was well until the day before admission, when his mother noted bruising on both medial thighs, which she attributed to use of a jumping chair. On the morning of admission, she noted increased bruising on his thighs and \u201cbroken capillaries\u201d on his cheeks and eyelids. On examination at another hospital, he was active and behaviorally appropriate. The rectal temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 146 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were multiple scattered petechiae on the face, chest, and legs; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory results are shown inTable 1. He was transferred to this hospital. Laboratory Data. The patient was active and developmentally normal. At 3 months of age, intermittent urticaria had developed when small amounts of a milk-based formula were given, mixed with breast milk. There was no history of trauma, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, or blood in the urine or stool. He was born to a primigravida by cesarean section because of preeclampsia, after full-term gestation. Immunizations were current, excluding influenza A (H1N1) and seasonal influenza vaccines. Acetaminophen had been administered for teething pain until 2 days before this presentation. He had no known allergies. He lived with his parents and two dogs, did not attend day care, and had no exposures to sick persons. A cousin of his mother had splenomegaly of unknown cause; there was no known family history of hematologic disorders. The vital signs and physical examination were unchanged. The ABO blood type was A, Rh-positive, with negative screening for antibodies to red cells. Blood levels of electrolytes, phosphorus, magnesium, urea nitrogen, direct and total bilirubin, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and liver function; other test results are shown inTable 1. Anti-RhD immune globulin (referred to as anti-D) (550 \u03bcg [50 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight]) was administered intravenously. Test results from the next day are shown inTable 1. Blood cultures drawn at the other hospital remained sterile, and the patient was discharged home. Subsequent outpatient evaluation revealed platelet counts of 120,000 per cubic millimeter on the second day after discharge and 32,000 per cubic millimeter on the sixth day after discharge; the hematocrit was 28.1%, the hemoglobin level 9.6 g per deciliter, and reticulocytes 16.6%. Ten days after discharge, the platelet count was 1000 per cubic millimeter. The patient was readmitted to this hospital. The pulse was 139 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the weight 11.2 kg; other vital signs were normal. There were isolated petechiae on the tongue and fine petechiae on the face and thighs. Test results are shown inTable 1. Intravenous immune globulin was infused, and the patient was discharged the next day. During the next 9 days, testing for antinuclear antibody was positive at a 1:40 dilution and negative at 1:80 and 1:160 dilutions (normal, negative at 1:40 and 1:160 dilutions) with a speckled pattern, and testing for antigranulocyte antibodies was negative; other test results are shown inTable 1. When the patient was 8 months of age, a diagnosis of milk allergy was made based on the presence of urticaria, diarrhea, and radioallergosorbent testing, and soy-based formula was begun. Diarrhea resolved, but he vomited frequently. Two months after the first admission, when the patient was 8.5 months of age, fever to a temperature of 38.9\u00b0C developed that was unresponsive to outpatient ceftriaxone therapy. This was followed by worsening diarrhea, nonbilious emesis, and increasing lethargy over a period of several days, as well as fever to a temperature of 40\u00b0C. Blood cultures were sterile.

The patient had been well until 7 years before this admission, when gray stools with mucus and streaks of blood developed. During the next year, evaluation at another hospital led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. Mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was administered. Four years before this admission, he was admitted to another hospital because of a severe flare of ulcerative colitis. Colonoscopic examination confirmed clinically significant disease extending to the transverse colon, and histologic examination confirmed active colitis. Prednisone and mesalamine were administered, and the patient's condition improved. He declined additional immunosuppressive therapy, and prednisone was gradually tapered off. Approximately 3 years before this admission, the patient was seen in an outpatient clinic at this hospital because of increased stool frequency and hematochezia of 1 week's duration. He reported that he had previously decreased the dose of mesalamine and then had stopped it altogether for a total of 2 weeks because of acneiform lesions that he attributed to the drug. He then resumed taking the decreased dose of mesalamine. A tapered course of prednisone was prescribed. He declined azathioprine treatment. During the next 2.5 years, symptoms of ulcerative colitis flares recurred, for which he sporadically took delayed-release mesalamine and courses of prednisone; 6-mercaptopurine was transiently administered but was discontinued because of elevated liver-function values. He declined anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor therapy. The patient maintained a grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free diet with probiotics. He was seen intermittently at an outpatient clinic of this hospital for follow-up visits for his ulcerative colitis; laboratory test results from 5 months before this admission are shown inTable 1. Laboratory Data. Approximately 2 months before this admission, fluctuating symptoms that were thought to be consistent with a flare of ulcerative colitis occurred, including abdominal cramping in the left lower quadrant, frequent liquid diarrhea with urgency, bloody stools, back spasms, and joint pains. The patient declined colonoscopic evaluation, but the fecal calprotectin level was elevated at 473 \u03bcg per gram of stool (normal value, \u226450). Twenty days before this admission, on follow-up evaluation at an outpatient clinic of this hospital, he reported partial symptomatic improvement with dietary changes, rest, and additional probiotics, and he noted that he was not taking other medications. He was reportedly allergic to penicillins and erythromycins. He asked about possible fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of his disease flare; he was informed that FMT was an available therapy for recurrentClostridium difficilecolitis, but efficacy in ulcerative colitis was not proved. On examination, he appeared comfortable; the weight was 67.7 kg, and the remainder of the examination, including an abdominal examination, was normal. Laboratory test results are shown inTable 1. He declined colonoscopy and 5-aminosalicylic acid\u2013based medications, including enemas. Prednisone was administered. Fourteen days before this admission, the patient began taking an increased dose of prednisone because of increasing stool frequency (up to six episodes daily) and persistent hematochezia. Two days later, he had a telephone consultation, and hydrocortisone enemas were prescribed; partial improvement was noted after 5 days. Three days before this admission, he reported fevers with a peak temperature of 38.1\u00b0C, a stool frequency of four or five episodes per day, and hematochezia. On the day of this admission, the patient returned to the outpatient clinic because of persistent symptoms. He reported that he had urgent, frequent, bloody bowel movements up to 10 times daily, weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, minor joint pains, left-sided abdominal pain not related to eating, weight loss of 4 kg during the preceding 3 weeks, drenching night sweats, and fever, with a peak temperature of 38.8\u00b0C the previous evening. He revealed that he had performed home FMT with stool obtained from his wife and 10-month-old child on four occasions several weeks earlier. He had a history of iron-deficiency anemia (for which iron had been administered orally and intravenously), low testosterone (for which clomiphene citrate had been administered in the past), vitamin D deficiency, anxiety, seasonal allergies, and a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (for which isoniazid had been administered in the past). Medications also included probiotics and vitamin D3. He lived with his wife and child and worked in an office. He drank alcohol rarely and did not smoke cigarettes or use intravenous drugs. He had traveled to Central America and South America in the past. He was of European ancestry. There was no family history of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. On examination, the patient appeared pale and thin. The temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/56 mm Hg, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 64.0 kg, the height 180 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.8. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, with bowel sounds and mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were results of tests of renal and liver function; other test results are shown inTable 1.

In childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adulthood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bronchitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids. Twelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin-prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmental allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed.

DLcodenotes diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and FVC forced vital capacity.\u2020On bronchodilator testing, a positive response was defined as an increase in the FEV1of more than 0.2 liters or by more than 12% after the administration of a bronchodilator. Eleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation \u2014 a patchy ground-glass pattern \u2014 at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal congestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <127), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary-function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol was prescribed. Five years 9 months before this evaluation, the patient was referred for pulmonary consultation. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastroesophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheezing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range, <600), with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were undetectable. Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. The patient was seen by an otolaryngologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range, <5). The patient was unable to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmonologist; inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol was substituted for inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and weight loss was advised. Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown inTable 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months before this evaluation are shown inTable 1. At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. The blood hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pattern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <114), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, andCladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patient\u2019s symptoms had not abated, and subcutaneous benralizumab was prescribed. Three months before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown inTable 1. One month later,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. The patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a \u201craspy\u201d voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years. The patient\u2019s medical history included eczema, hypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple procedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, including shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone\u2013umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizumab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisinopril had caused a cough, and macrolides had caused diarrhea. The patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for approximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and allergen-proof bedsheets.", "true_dx": "Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia.", "pred_dx": "Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis", "correct": false, "sentences": [{"s": "Alright, let's see what's going on here.", "t": 0, "c": "15", "i": 1, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "We've got a 70-year-old woman who's having trouble breathing when she exerts herself.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 2, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's also got some allergy issues, like eczema and hay fever, which seem to have calmed down over the years.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 3, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But now, she's dealing with something more persistent.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 4, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Hmm, let's dig into her past.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 5, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She had pneumonia and was exposed to some nasty stuff at a construction site, which led to bronchitis.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 6, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's definitely something to keep in mind.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 7, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Now, she's experiencing respiratory problems again, and it seems like it's getting worse.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 8, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Her lung function tests show some interesting patterns.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 9, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "There's a drop in FEV1 and FVC, indicating some kind of restrictive lung disease.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 10, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "And there's this thing called DLCO, which is low too.", "t": 2, "c": "7", "i": 11, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "This could mean something is affecting how her lungs exchange gases.", "t": 5, "c": "8", "i": 12, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Oh, and she has these lung nodules on her CT scans.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 13, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "They're small, about 2 to 4 mm, and they've been there for a while.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 14, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "It's not just the nodules though; there's this mosaic pattern on her lungs, which suggests some kind of inflammation or scarring.", "t": 1, "c": "1", "i": 15, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's been to a bunch of doctors, and they've tried different treatments.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 16, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She's on all sorts of medications, including inhalers and even biologics.", "t": 1, "c": "4", "i": 17, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "But nothing seems to really help her symptoms.", "t": 1, "c": "5", "i": 18, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "That's concerning.", "t": 2, "c": "9", "i": 19, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "Let's think about what could cause these symptoms.", "t": 0, "c": "12", "i": 20, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "She doesn't smoke, and there's no sign of infection or cancer.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 21, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "No mold or chemical exposure either.", "t": 5, "c": "0", "i": 22, "x": null, "y": null}, {"s": "So, what else could it be?
